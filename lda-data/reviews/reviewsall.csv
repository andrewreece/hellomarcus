The third outing for a herd of toys that should have stayed in their boxes.__Despite its manifest improvements, there is something so sour and unpleasant about the new film that it left me almost nostalgic for the innocent idiocies of its predecessor.__At 157 minutes, "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" isn't just a movie. It's a sentence.__For good or ill, Bay is the soul of a new machine, the poet of post-human cinema, the CEO of Hollywood's military-entertainment complex.__Marveling at its grotesque gigantism doesn't make this two-and-a-half-hour-long movie any less dull.__If you're going to make a movie in which some of your stars are animated toys and much of downtown Chicago is reduced to rubble, this is the way to do it: shamelessly, with no expense spared and no cliche avoided.__One can argue that summer is built for spectacle. Now if only it could be truly spectacular, too.__It's a lousy movie, but at least it's a lousy movie with a serviceable story, killer CGI and an action climax that goes on forever (at least an hour).__Watching Transformers: Dark of the Moon makes you die a little inside. Is this the future of movies? God help us! Michael Bay, you've done it again.__OK, I'll admit it -- this is hard -- the big silly thing is sort of great.__Fine actors like John Turturro and John Malkovich are encouraged to strip-mine the scenery. Frances McDormand, playing a government bigwig, can now rest content knowing she has given the worst performance of her career. (Not her fault, either.)__A wearyingly overlong series of battles and explosions with the thinnest of connective tissue and an ADD-like disregard for follow-through.__I miraculously survived a preview screening with a throbbing headache and slight nausea; others may not be so lucky.__Between Bay's obsession to make his 3-D matter and the artistry of the special effects legions amassed for the project, the visual payoff is striking.__The more action sequences, locations, actors, historical events, machines, effects, monosyllables, weapons, and American-flag close-ups the movie shoves in its mouth and ours, the less we're able to taste.__Shot by shot, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, like all of Bay's work, has a meticulous commercial sheen that's distinctive and beautiful, but he never lingers on any one of them for long, and they rarely make sense in sequence.__It's a momentous achievement and it will make untold amounts of money and you should see it even though it's hateful and empty and preaches the worst kind of reactionary violence without even really meaning it.__The biggest casualties in this third installment of the robot franchise from director Michael Bay are storytelling and character development.__Bay provides his usual Bayisms: bloated close-ups, manly slo-mo, visual hyperbole and glamour shots of a hot babe standing amid the wreckage.__Easily the best Transformers of the series, Dark of the Moon is everything that's boisterous and lively about our big studio cinema.
The Hangover Part II isn't a dud, exactly -- some of it is very funny, and there are a few memorable jolts and outlandish dirty moments. But it feels, at times, like a routine adventure film set overseas.__The missing person, the seamy urban setting, the gradual accretion of clues: The Hangover films are, essentially, hard-boiled crime stories spun into comic depravity.__I can't dismiss the ugliness behind many of its antics.__I can't believe how precisely everything does happen again, except that what was fresh and surprising in Las Vegas turns rancid and predictable in Bangkok, where yet another wedding is scheduled to take place.__Directed, like the wildly successful first film, by Todd Phillips, it airlifts the original characters, premise, and story structure out of Vegas and plonks them down in Bangkok in near-identical form, save for a few instances of ante-upping.__It's a tribute to the filmmakers, particularly director and co-writer Todd Phillips, that the best way to approach The Hangover Part II is to talk about what it isn't. It isn't a typical sequel, either a watered-down encore or a muddled [extension].__One of the most uninspired and unoriginal sequels you'll ever see. Or not see, if you're lucky.__Phillips and his co-writers, Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong, seem to have launched into this project with a misguided faith in their own brilliance, but nothing resembling an idea or a story.__The filmmakers can't recapture the original's novelty or freshness, so they up the raunch level considerably; the matter-of-factness of the transsexual and gay-panic jokes is almost progressive.__The Hangover made the actors A-list Hollywood stars. But despite the indisputable talent of this cast, The Hangover Part II doesn't deliver the same zany punch of its predecessor.__Maybe what goes on in Vegas really should stay in Vegas.__Alas, this time there are about three or four mild laughs in the whole picture, and the entire visual aspect of the movie is a botched disappointment.__Somebody must have roofied me. I left The Hangover Part II feeling dazed and abused, wondering how bad things happened to such a good comedy.__It feels a little bit like that fourth dirty martini - not a good idea at the time, and probably to be regretted later.__Oh, what a headache-inducing, unapologetic money grab we have in "The Hangover Part II."__While these characters were amusing the first time around, Phillips and his screenwriters don't bring much new to the party.__For all the talent Hangover II reassembles, our boys just can't muster the hair of the dog that bit them the first time around.__If you want to avoid plot spoilers for The Hangover Part II, don't watch The Hangover.__The result is a cinematic illustration of the law of diminishing returns, in which more money, more exotic locales, more crazy situations and more Mike Tyson all fuel a familiar carnival of abasement.__Phillips seems to be relying all too heavily on the idea that we just want to see the first movie again. (We can do that. At home. For a lot less money.)
Depp, grimacing, edges in and out of the action and seems irrelevant and bored most of the time.__I've never seen a film in which what was actually onscreen seemed so irrelevant.__Ahoy me hearties, No. 4 is surprisingly not bad.__The franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it...__It's never quite clear what the relationship between Jack and Angelica is. Sometimes it's love, sometimes it's hate; it probably depended on who was writing the script that day.__Ian McShane gives Blackbeard as much menace as a goofball romp can handle.__Except for one moment in the climactic Fountain of Youth scene, I never once thought, wow, what a magical place I'm being invited to visit.__It has the feel of a TV drama renewed for one season too many, a last, furtive run at the till before it closes for business.__Small kids won't really appreciate Johnny Depp either, though frankly he's getting to be less fun as the series ages, possibly realizing that what's riskiest in Pirates 4 isn't walking the plank, but jumping the shark.__With further sequels already in the works, and billions more to be made, I would nevertheless like to point out that the wind went out of these pirate ship sails a long time ago.__Marshall deserves props for putting the "show" back into the Pirates business. But face it, he's polishing a giant turd.__The movie was written by "Pirates" stalwarts Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. They're funny guys, and the script might well be funny too, but it's hard to tell from the metronome rhythms set for the actors by the director, Rob Marshall...__"On Stranger Tides" feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails.__The more sequels spun off, the clearer it becomes that one movie about these swashbucklers would have sufficed.__Cutlasses flash, music swells, mast sways, critic yawns.__For all his faults, Gore Verbinski at least handled the action with panache. Those movies thrummed with derring-do. This one sinks.__If you want to burden your movie from the outset, give it a protagonist who can't grow, can't change, can't feel and wants nothing. Then give Depp total license to mug his way out of this confinement.__Dead Man's Chest and At World's End meandered so far off course, and took so long to get there, that almost any Act 4 encore would qualify as a quantum leap forward.__There's little if anything here to keep us emotionally invested, and so the pile-it-on mutinies and sword fights and perilous dives off vertiginous cliffs exist just to wow us.__POTC was never about nuance, and now it's even less so: It's about watching Depp fall into peril and wriggle his way out, over and over, for hours.
Fast Five is grindingly mechanical -- and not just because of all the emphasis on car repairs and retooling.__[Johnson's] skin looks as though it's been slathered in butter; his enjoyment is infectious and keeps the movie speeding along.__That force of chaotic and unsatisfiable desire that Freud called the id is much closer to the surface in a movie like "Fast Five" than ever before in action-cinema history, and part of Lin's peculiar genius is that he barely tries to conceal it.__The chemistry of the core cast - steered by Vin Diesel and Paul Walker - keeps this outing from running on fumes.__The whole thing progresses to one of the looniest heists of all time. The result is the most exciting, visually jazzy, and absurd entry in the series.__As the summer of 2011 approaches with the speed of a souped-up Dodge Charger, I'm going to take my action-movie blessings where I can find them.__You can't say Fast Five delivers the goods, but it delivers what it's supposed to.__Always preposterous though never actually silly, knowingly funny without ever being self-conscious, Fast Five is a passable action flick that will more than entertain its core audience.__Bold and beautiful in its hard-charging simplicity.__Embarrassingly fun, the sort of speedy, senseless, violence-crammed action flick that virtually defines the summer season, with superheroes who aren't gods or crusaders in tights but guys in T-shirts and jeans who can drive cars really fast.__If there were any more testosterone here, Jose Canseco could have boiled down the screen and injected it.__By shifting into a previously untapped gear, it delivers the most entertaining "Fast and Furious" adventure while also getting 2011's summer movie season off on the right lead foot.__Something like Ocean's Eleven and its various numerations, except with muscle cars and knuckleheads and without the laughs.__Instead of a vroomer, we get a knucklehead "Ocean's 11."__Gets lots of mileage from a combination of high spirits, scorn for the laws of physics, readily renewable energy and an emphasis on family values -- not those of the nuclear family, but of hell-raising, drag-racing outlaws...__Ignoring the rules of physics doesn't make a movie more entertaining; it merely makes the writing easier. If a screenplay can cheat at any time, it encourages sloppy authorship.__The first sequel to the 2001 "The Fast and the Furious" that's worth watching, that isn't an embarrassment or a travesty of the original picture.__The series takes the curious, surprising and rather brave route of ditching the street-racing shenanigans that defined the series in favor of a more standard action-oriented plot. It's an interesting approach, but the series' shallowness remains__A movie with exploding toilets, cars that move sideways and a big chase sequence with Walker and Brewster fleeing favela goons by crashing through the tin roofs of shanty-town shacks.__Who knew the fourth sequel to The Fast and the Furious would not only refuel a flagging franchise, but lead the pack as the best of the bunch?
Don't tell the kids, but Santa Claus isn't real and Pixar is fallible.__Time, perhaps, for the franchise to be towed off to the scrapyard. Sorry, Pixar.__It's an example of what a sequel should, or at least can, be.__Cars 2 is marginally better than its predecessor, but the same problem still remains: Cars just aren't very interesting as anthropomorphic animation vehicles (pun intended).__...by Pixar's outrageous standards of Oscar shoo-in virtuosity, this sequel is a disappointment at best.__Larry the Cable Guy has helped make Mater one of Pixar's sweetest creations. He just happens to reside in the studio's least-magical franchise.__Not that Cars 2 is an actively bad animated film. It's just sort of an average animated film.__Unlike most Pixar fare, this isn't a movie you can imagine many adults wanting to see without their children in tow.__Although it would be unfair to label Cars 2 as unwatchable, it is surprisingly tedious in parts and not as satisfying as one might expect.__Someone must like Mater, who's already had his own spinoff TV show. Just as someone must like Larry the Cable Guy, who voices him. But that someone isn't me, and if it isn't you, you're in for one very long matinee.__As lovable as Mater is, let's face it: A little bit of Larry the Cable Guy goes a long way.__They said it couldn't be done. But Pixar proved the yaysayers wrong when it made its first bad movie, "Cars." Now it has worsted itself with the even more awful "Cars 2."__Lasseter and his team's pitch-perfect way with genre cliches revs up the espionage subplot.__It's a worthwhile diversion... but let's hope that Lasseter and friends soon return to the emotional ambition that has made Pixar such a reliable brand to date.__Cars 2 demonstrates that not every hit movie merits a sequel.__"Cars 2" teaches gentle kid-friendly lessons about the importance of friendship and being yourself and introduces some great new characters in its parallel spy drama and auto racing plots.__In terms of story and atmosphere and overall feeling, "Cars 2" is a brand-new experience - and a distinct improvement.__The law of averages has finally caught up with the most remarkable studio in modern movie history, the dream factory that lived up to Buzz Lightyear's joyous cry of "To infinity and beyond." This frenzied sequel seldom gets beyond mediocrity.__We've come to expect perfection from Pixar, mostly because Pixar expects perfection from itself.__"Cars 2" might be a better James Bond film than five or six of the actual Bond films, and the fact that its hero is a bucktoothed, redneck tow truck without a hood does nothing to detract from its (admittedly modest) appeal.
It's complete trash and makes a mockery of Holmes's vaunted deductive reasoning.__Downey's career is something of a game of shadows, but it's one still worth playing, for now.__Downey and Law remain this presumptive franchise's draw.__What this film really celebrates is crunch-and-thud video-game-style action, not especially well choreographed by director Guy Ritchie.__It doesn't take a master of deduction to see that Ritchie has decided to play it too safe with this sequel.__In an act of criminal negligence, Ritchie has wasted Robert Downey Jr. in a sequel that eliminates smarts in favor of relentless headbanging.__Downey may think this interpretation is an insight, or funny, but it pushes what was already a rude rewriting of the classic characters into eye-rolling camp. And it throws everything off balance.__I was let down by this loud and flashy but utterly empty sequel.__This movie wants to be a horse but, even measured in box-office millions, it's just another nag.__Something of an overlong, overblown, disorganized mess, despite being slightly better than its predecessor.__Ritchie's franchise - 7% classic formula, 93% adrenaline - is smart in a showoffy way that flatters its star as well as its audience.__The skill level in the script is elementary school, my dear Watson.__It's a modest improvement on bad-boy director Guy Ritchie's first tweaking of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective.__There's nothing here but wreckage. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows" is so ineptly made that the story is advanced solely through announcements.__As Johnny Depp has done so brilliantly with his devilish Jack Sparrow, Downey has made this sly sardonic Sherlock stylistically all his own. Case closed.__The game is now afoot with Holmes' arch-nemesis, Professor James Moriarity -- and that makes a notable difference. This time, Holmes is up against an equal, and it's elementary indeed that muscle and firepower alone won't carry the day.__This new outing matches the original Sherlock in wit, action and the bromance between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.__The chemistry between Watson and Holmes is spotty, and their banter grows tedious.__Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows doesn't rip enough yarn.__"Diminishing returns" is a description that applies to many film series. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows" is a delicious exception.
Let's hope Branagh was well-compensated, at least. To quote his favorite author: No profit grows where is no pleasure taken.__Thor is on much safer ground here on Earth. The tone is immediately different: more relaxed; comic, not cosmic.__There is pleasure to be plundered from some of the battle scenes, especially when Thor is confronting ice monsters with blood-red eyes, and from the culture clash that resounds when he descends to present-day Earth...__The story might perhaps be adequate for an animated film for children, with Thor, Odin and the others played by piglets. In the arena of movies about comic book superheroes, it is a desolate vastation.__A giant notch up is Hiddleston, who'd make a good Edmund in King Lear: You register the chip on his shoulder rather than the villainy.__This is eminently missable, though the mosaic design of Asgard, Thor's mythical realm, is pretty cool.__I approached this new lollapalooza with an open mind that was quickly addled by loads of back story and front story and an ear-splitting avalanche of special effects.__Nothing against the buff, blond God of Thunder, but Thor just doesn't have a built-in wow factor among the nongeek brigade.__[Kenneth Branagh's] Shakespearean chops add texture in scenes that require the care and feeding of literature's grander themes: pride, paternity and honor.__Essentially, when the movie comes down to Earth it's pretty good. But when it spends time across the universe -- and it spends a lot of time across the universe -- it's pure geek fare. Which may thrill geeks but leave others yawning.__For those with a taste for the genre, Thor is a worthy addition to the pantheon.__The visuals are breathtaking without it, all swirling cosmic nebulae and mythic cityscapes of the Norse-god capital Asgard.__Thor seems to have little more on its mind than winning the first weekend and making its money back overseas, which it probably, predictably, will.__Branagh's Thoris big enough and bold enough to fit under the Marvel umbrella but infused with sufficient uniqueness to make it work for those weary of generic superhero stories.__Many things within Thor must be accepted at face value, but these very things are what make the whole enterprise feel inconsequential.__It's as if Branagh, fearful that his artsy reputation precedes him, has gone to the opposite extreme and low-balled the material.__Hemsworth, an Aussie actor with a vocal command to match his heaving brawn, doesn't just play the role, he owns it.__The effects are effective. The humor is humorous and just self-referential enough to let you know the film doesn't take itself too seriously.__The ripping outer-space fights are the main attraction, and they're mostly entertaining, though not in a way that will make you feel good about yourself.__If this is a harbinger of the season to come, may heaven and its suburbs help us.
Caesar [the main ape] is the reason to see this daft, breathless picture.__Rise of the Planet of the Apes is spectacle with a kick: the transcendence of the normal in creatures so like ourselves is both an entertainment and a needling rebuke to human vanity.__The action scenes (particularly a battle between humans and apes on the Golden Gate Bridge) are inventively spectacular, and the story at the movie's core is evocative and engaging.__Distinguishes itself from other ill-conceived reboots in general, and from Tim Burton's disastrous 2001 remake in particular, by looking with fresh, simian eyes at its core conflict between human and primates.__A well-crafted B movie with astonishingly effective motion capture CGI technology.__Tthe movie has some plot-point missteps. But it seldom puts the brakes on a story that moves toward a furious ape-human rumble, not in a jungle, but atop the Golden Gate Bridge.__A creature feature of disappointing stupidity, Rise of the Planet of the Apes replaces the sociopolitical underpinnings of the original film and its sequels with a limp warning about the evils of animal testing.__Pass the bananas.__[H]alf good and half bad, and the primary dividing line is by genus.__Since the only really good Planet of the Apes movie was the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, I've always wondered why filmmakers can't just leave well enough alone.__What isn't here are any of the joys of the classic film.__It's faint praise to say that this is the best of the "Planet of the Apes" movies, because the evolution of special effects and makeup was predictable. But the unexpected strength of the film is its heart.__The running time is efficient, the direction is clean, the story is simple but resonant, the effects are understated yet impressive, and the near-wordless star of the show puts on an acting clinic.__They probably should have called it "Beneath the Dignity of the Planet of the Apes," but "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is tolerable if you'll just keep in mind that the original feature was an overachieving B-movie.__The filmmakers seem to have spent so much attention and, presumably, money on getting the primates right that they completely forgot about the people.__Sweet fragrant bananas, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a blast.__Conjured through the ever-expanding magic of performance-capture technology, the apes are easily the most compelling elements of Apes.__The first half (presumably where most of the narrative scenes were excised) is frustratingly arrhythmic; more satisfying is the ape revolution of the final half-hour, a scary and deftly handled passage.__With its skillful blend of live action and motion-capture technology, it's a handsomely made prequel to familiar monkey business.__It is not what could be fairly called a bad movie, but neither is it fine enough to be a good one, with its lineup of dull characters and a limp story that functions like a conveyor belt.
It doesn't try too hard for irony or style; the comic-book sensibility remains pure, square, and happily stupid.__Pacy and punchy, but not quite a knockout.__Comic book fans are likely to appreciate Captain America, which does a good job of consolidating the disparate origin aspects of the character into something easily digestible.__The movie looks wonderful.__Kudos, then, to the creators of Captain America's big-screen blockbuster for keeping the action rooted in the past; except for some brief present-day bookends.__The only problem is that we've been there -- been nearly everywhere Captain America goes -- in countless previous movies.__Director Joe Johnston has fun with the myth of Captain America.__What lingers most about Captain America is its innocent, throwback ethos, a firm, unqualified embrace of the Little Guy.__With its mix of World War II nostalgia, Bam-Pow comic book sensibilities, underdog determination and red-white-and-blue battle scenes, Captain America: The First Avenger is the best Marvel superhero flick since the first Iron Man.__Scrawny Steve is such a guileless and likeable little dude that his sweetness endures long past the super-sizing.__Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely... whip up a Captain America story that often feels like its only purpose is to deliver Steve Rogers into the 21st century.__Joe Johnston -- returning to the vibe of his first directorial effort, The Rocketeer (1991) -- creates a fun retro-futurist environment with a World War II setting, and he has the discernment not to let the effects overwhelm the story.__Despite all the advance hype preceding its release, Captain America, yet another 3-D Marvel Comics concoction, straggles onto the screen with little reason to exist except as a marketing machine.__A forced love angle and vapid dialogue dooms Captain America.__"Captain America" smashingly layers superhero stuff such as magic serums atop a wry appreciation for campy WWII propaganda and '60s cinematic rousers that kept Richard Burton, Robert Shaw and Lee Marvin constantly employed.__The small things -- from the leading man to '40s flourishes -- are what make the movie work. If only Johnston had sweated the big stuff as well.__Rather than fight against the character's flag-waving, Nazi-busting roots, the movie embraces them, going back to the early '40s to remind us what made the "greatest generation" so great.__Captain America: The First Avenger is pretty good, insofar as it's not nearly as terrible as it seemed destined to be.__Captain America's metabolism, Peggy tells him, burns energy four times faster than the average person's. The movie's metabolism burns out.__Yes, the characters are cartoonish (they're comic book heroes, after all), but this is the kind of old-fashioned popcorn entertainment summer is made for.
Yes, it gets a bit sentimental. Yes, some 'Ya-Ya Sisterhood' friendship cliches creep in. Yes, it glosses history. But it's also heartfelt, hilarious and the cast is a dream-team topped by Viola Davis.__"The Help" takes us on a pop-cultural tour that savors the picturesque, and strengthens stereotypes it purports to shatter.__Thanks to a talented cast -- starting with leads Emma Stone, Viola Davis&#8203; and Octavia Spencer&#8203; -- the movie is often entertaining. But The Help should have been challenging too.__As in many reductive period pieces, there are no real characters here, just archetypes, namely reactionary cretins and sensitive souls who anticipate modern attitudes.__The Help is a high-functioning tearjerker, but the catharsis it offers feels glib and insufficient, a Barbie Band-Aid on the still-raw wound of race relations in America.__[The Help] is, in some ways, crude and obvious, but it opens up a broad new swath of experience on the screen, and parts of it are so moving and well acted that any objections to what's second-rate seem to matter less as the movie goes on.__Appalling, entertaining, touching and perhaps even a bit healing, The Help is an old-fashioned grand yarn of a film, the sort we rarely get these days.__A splendid entertainment -- a film that makes us for root for the good guys, hiss at the bad and convulse in laughter when good wreaks vengeance with a smile.__The Help brings a chick-flick sensibility to a serious subject, which is more daring than it might sound. It's also incredibly refreshing.__While the book's minor -- but crucial -- details are often overlooked, the major themes are thrust on screen with forceful simplicity, as if Taylor doesn't trust us to understand the stakes.__The Help will make you laugh, yes, but it can also break your heart. In the dog days of August moviegoing, that's a powerful recommendation.__The Help belongs to Viola Davis.__Now comes the inevitable movie, which, in the hands of writer/director Tate Taylor, does a novel about injustice an injustice itself: It turns lite into featherweight.__There's something lived-in and genuine about this infectious melodrama.__Shot like an inductee in the Hallmark Hall Of Fame, The Help covers an ugly era in superficial gloss that's only punctured by the particulars of Mississippi race law or hiring practices that are a mere hairsbreadth away from slavery.__While it may not always be subtle, it pulls off a rare feat of sincerity.__The movie isn't perfect; it sometimes shows its stitching. But mostly it's a stirring salute to subjugated women who hold their heads high.__For every obvious turn The Help takes, there is Davis, the ideal counterweight.__Mississippi's burning, but it's nothing a little race-transcending grrrl power won't cure.__"The Help" definitely worked on me as a consummate tear-jerker with a terrific cast, and it's pretty much the summer's only decent Hollywood drama.
The star and co-writer of Bridesmaids, Kristen Wiig, puts herself and her female co-stars through the comedy wringer.__Bridesmaids is likely to be a hit with both women and men, being half formula chick-flick, half raunchy comedy of humiliation. It's hilarious -- and too bifurcated to be satisfying.__Onetime Saturday Night Live castmates Wiig and Rudolph make Annie and Lillian's friendship believable. Which is why Annie's shenanigans are sad -- and hilarious.__The movie won't change your life or grab a fistful of Oscar nominations come next winter. But it will make you laugh, hard and often, and it proves that sometimes girls just want to have fun.__An effortless blend of bad taste and good humour with a wholly believable, often very touching emotional core, all centred around one of the finest star-making comic performances in recent memory.__The movie is uneven and lurching, but it provides many laughs.__Bridesmaids is a stiletto-sharp, raunchy, no-holds-barred yuk-fest that stands as a worthy female counterpart to the likes of Wedding Crashers and The Hangover.__Wiig has terrific audience rapport, a prerequisite for comics, and a squiggly way of seeming totally reasonable and altogether daft at the same time.__The only question is: Will Kristen Wiig ever be this good again? The answer is, let's hope so. Bridesmaids rocks. Hopefully, a movie star is born.__In the end, Bridesmaids is touching and funny and a tiny bit sickening. Just like a real wedding.__The warring impulses within Wiig set a wonderfully skittish tone for the painfully hilarious new movie Bridesmaids, a screwy tale of female friendship and wedding planning from hell.__It's not a movie for people looking for a decorous night at the movies. It is a film, though, for folks eager for some good dirty jokes, some refreshingly real female characters - and, just maybe, a new comic voice.__If this is only a chick flick, then call me a chick.__It's the smaller, more observant moments in "Bridesmaids" that make it worth savoring.__By the time two hours had dragged by, I felt a lot like I had sat through a five-hour wedding.__Kristen Wiig is the best sketch comic alive, and "Bridesmaids" should finally make her a movie star.__That rarest of treats: an R-rated romantic comedy from the Venus point of view.__After shining on SNL, Kristen Wiig finally has a lead role worthy of her comic talents. And wedding prep gets the absurdly humorous treatment it deserves.__A film of great hilarity, humanity, idiosyncrasy and grade-A, eyebrow-singeing raunch.__Bridesmaids has a couple of X chromosomes up its sleeve, and you're wrong if you think that's merely a cosmetic difference.
[A] satisfying, if less than sensational, sequel to the funny, charming and action-packed animated feature from 2008.__A solid slice of summer entertainment: forgettable, perhaps, but plenty of fun while it lasts.__Jack Black once again shows his excellence as a voice actor.__Hardly a scene goes by that isn't visually striking or kinetically thrilling, and all of it enhanced by 3-D.__Po and friends redeem themselves with a terrific third act, the animation (in three distinct styles) is superb and there's enough hiii-YA-ing to keep the kids yipping throughout.__The film's visuals are thrilling, beguiling, vivid: the greens of a glade or a terraced hillside; the molten reds of Shen's smelting works or yellow-orange arcs of fireworks.__No, we're not talking about Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter, although it does feel that way early on in the animated Kung Fu Panda 2.__Alas, this time there are about three or four mild laughs in the whole picture, and the entire visual aspect of the movie is a botched disappointment.__Has a bright palette, an amiable vibe and enough vivacity to keep kids entertained and any accompanying moms from bolting for Bridesmaids.__The original film was a compelling surprise, an unusually fun and sophisticated take on the wacky-animal CGI movie. The sequel remains visually beautiful and strikingly designed, but otherwise, it's a surprise in all the wrong ways.__For a movie touting "inner peace," this 3-D sequel sure goes in for its share of battle scenes, but for the most part they are excitingly conceived by director Jennifer Yuh Nelson and her writers, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger.__The freshness and novelty that made the original film such a kick back in 2008 has been, well, kicked to bits.__The kinder, gentler Kung Fu Panda 2 will surely try the patience of older children and fun-seeking parents.__What really makes the film work... is director Yuh's sense of timing. She knows how to get in and out of a joke before beating it to death. A quick Pac-Man reference during a chase comes and goes, delighting without ever dragging.__A breezy, funny, touching, action-packed sequel.__Like that kung pao chicken at the back of your fridge, none of it's quite as crisp the second time around.__Nearly matches the original in charm and kicks.__With its mix of vibrant CG and classical elements, the movie dazzles.__Black's Po manages to retain his requisite bumptiousness while also making a credible action hero.__Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson's true cannon fist is how seamlessly "Panda's" wild skirmishes mesh with its eloquent narrative, even if there are less pauses for reflection this time 'round.
'Puss in Boots' is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven.__Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious.__An almost purr-fect little film that even a dog owner can enjoy.__It would overstate matters to say Puss in Boots leaves its cat holding the bag (we had to get that in). But it also leaves its hero awaiting a richer fable, one befitting his charms and his portrayer's talents.__The character may be here to save the day, but the movie's only here to pass the time and it does that just fine.__It's the morally-cracked Humpty who provides the film's emotional trajectory. Puss in Boots is a fun feline frolic -- with just a little egg on its face.__Almost shockingly good. And not just because a lot of you will approach it with lowered expectations.__With his impeccable comic timing and lyrical Spanish accent, Banderas' swashbuckling charmer is an undeniable treat.__Basically, this toon is a tired riff on Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, punctuated by more puns and cat jokes than you can shake a litter box at.__A cheerfully chaotic jumble of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters parachuted into a Spanish storybook setting.__Perhaps the most engaging thing about "Puss in Boots" is that it never takes itself too seriously.__Puss made his debut in "Shrek 2," then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now he's got a movie of his own, and not a moment too soon.__Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? "Puss in Boots" has about half as much entertainment value.__It's always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience all the way up the line.__"Puss in Boots'' doesn't break any new ground in the storytelling department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike...__In the Shrek films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, is that no one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in Puss in Boots, that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes.__Even if they don't provide much lift, these boots were made for amusement.__Even for a Shrek spin-off, Puss In Boots is mighty thin gruel, based more in outsized emotion than actual narrative.__I left dreaming of a world in which cats could tango - and when's the last time a movie did that?__The cat came back. Good thing, too.
The climax is the biggest letdown, a giant hash of crosscutting and unremarkable (in an era in which we've seen everything) CGI.__As X-Men films go, this one gets the job done and is certainly better than Last Stand or Wolverine. But there are still just too darn many X-Men.__Looks and feels like a very cheesy Cold War-era B movie...__It uses the themes of the previous movies to build an intelligent, fast-paced, and highly entertaining prequel.__This blazing "pre-boot" breathes new life into the sagging franchise__New decade; same ol' same ol'.__Lacking a single memorable joke or striking image, First Class is as perfunctory and passionless as would-be franchise resurrections get.__It's a strangely talky motion picture that tries to advance several philosophical themes; these would have been more interesting if we weren't already aware of how they will play out in the "future" X-Men trilogy.__We all love a good creation myth. That's partly why X-Men: First Class is such fanboy fun.__The finest comic-book flick since 2008's The Dark Knight.__Erik/Magneto, as played by Michael Fassbender, is, well, magnetic.__Even without making the honor roll, "X-Men: First Class" has earned a pass for future semesters.__Revives the flagging franchise with this globe-trotting iteration, infusing it with new life and dazzling visual effects.__The X-Men franchise always had a lot on its mind compared to most of its superhero brethren.__Too bad that First Class torpedoes its lofty intentions with flights of idiocy so wrongheaded as to be almost endearing.__"First Class" happily delivers on the escapism and rich narrative texture the best of its predecessors have promised.__McAvoy and Fassbender are a casting triumph. These two have, yes, real star magnetism, both individually and together: They're both cool and intense, suave and unaffected, playful and dead serious about their grand comic-book work.__[Some] ludicrous but endearing moments of bro-bonding are all that sets this otherwise stock-issue superhero movie apart from its mass-produced brethren.__In most respects it's a solid effort that maintains the integrity of this rather earnest series.__Preaching mutant pride with endearing fervor, "X-Men: First Class" proves to be a mutant in its own right -- a zestfully radical departure from the latter spawn of a sputtering franchise.
Rio is a brightly-colored, dizzying pinwheel of 3D animation in which nothing much happens. Sounds like summer is here early.__Expect the expected.__Rio will not set your heart afire, although its low-level consciousness raising about illegally smuggled animals is nice. Mostly, it's brightly colored fluff, but then, it's supposed to be.__A fairly typical children's movie, but at least it moves along with purpose!__The generic story elements can't spoil the real achievement of Rio, which is a series of vividly choreographed set-pieces.__Eisenberg's tremulous, earnest delivery matches Blu's big worrywart eyes perfectly, and he and Hathaway, to their credit, give it their all.__Buoyed by local color - literally, with a vibrantly sun-drenched palette, a sensationally festive Carnival parade, and a slinky samba-licious soundtrack__This is a movie that takes even the hoariest quest-peril-life lesson tropes of family animated films and imbues them with new life and rhythm.__I have a feeling that older audience members will, like me, be getting restless during this celebrity-voice-driven, generically plotted variation on "Madagascar."__Although the road to "Rio" was paved with good intentions, this 'toon never truly takes flight.__There are worse things than a movie that can't stop moving.__As kids' movies go, "Rio" brings a lot to the party.__More things work than not in this sweetened sweet bird of youth. Maybe the G is for good fun or great music or a gentle good time.__For its stunning iridescent look and infectious music, Rio is a refreshing adventure worth taking.__The humor's a little strange, and the action's a little frenetic, but all of it whooshes past in a swirl of tropical color and pseudo-South American bonhomie.__In an era where Pixar is constantly trying to better itself and other CGI studios are working to not merely imitate it, but to surpass it, it's vaguely grating to sit through another formulaic, paint-by-numbers effort from Fox Animation.__"Rio" is strong on relationships, visually novel, full of fresh ideas and featuring a few vocal actors you might not have expected to be part of the fun.__Here is a splashy display of the innocent, artful exuberance that, these days, the directors of live-action films have left to the guys with pixels.__Storks samba! Toucans tumba! Parrots party in kaleidoscopic formations to the music of Sergio Mendes!__The director, Carlos Saldanha, collaborated on the "Ice Age" trilogy. What he has developed here has tons of atmosphere and, less helpfully, tons of over-plotted chaos disguised as a story.
To play The Smurfs Drinking Game you will need: Two 500cl bottles of Blue Bols (per player), one white sleeping cap, ample powder-blue face paint and too much spare time.__Gosnell directs as if every scene must be either a nauseating roller-coaster ride or a syrupy melodrama.__The Smurfs ends up being just below average, it won't give you nightmares, and small ones might dig it.__That two sequels have been announced is terrifying.__It's raw and mean-spirited, with too many of the Smurf word substitutions more naughty than nice ("Who Smurfed?" or "Where the Smurf are we?"). That's Smurfed up.__The Smurfs mostly takes place in a grown-up world of cosmetics advertising and expectant parents. Without a child character to interpret and join the action, it's a pretty dull way to introduce young viewers to the new blue crew.__Director Raja Gosnell also made "Scooby-Doo" and "Beverly Hills Chihuahua." At least for families, this is a bit smurfing better than those.__I wouldn't smurf Gosnell's 'The Smurfs' on my smurfiest enemy.__'The Smurfs" is a lot like the characters' theme song: sweet, repetitive and grating.__Kids are sure to find it smurf-errific, smurf-ilicious or just plain smurfy. Adults will happily settle for smurf-ectly inoffensive.__[A] relentlessly witless and cynical children's movie packed with potty jokes, product plugs and double-entendres along the lines of "What the Smurf?"__On a hot summer day, "The Smurfs" is a decent enough excuse to haul the little ones into an air-conditioned theater.__"The Smurfs" has brains, heart and style, which will endear it to adults as well as young viewers.__There are a handful of genuinely sweet scenes in Smurfs promptly undone by adult actors and filmmakers, who must believe that the little blue troublemakers couldn't maintain a film on their own.__Even Neil Patrick Harris, who has proved he can save just about any sinking ship (see prime-time awards shows such as the Emmys or Tonys), cannot make this boat float.__Smurfs are the Barneys of the fantasy world.__A better movie than anyone could have possibly expected, thanks in large part to an honest effort by Harris in a thankless role.__In all, the worst parts of "The Smurfs'' can probably be summed up in two words: Smurf rap.__Adorable and annoying, patently unnecessary yet kinda sweet, it's a calculated commercial enterprise with little soul but an appreciable amount of heart.__Does for children's entertainment what lead paint does for children's toys.
__Flails about in search of a creative reason to exist.__The obvious nods to Castaway, Lost and other pop culture references are barely worth a grin.__You usually have to go to an Adam Sandler movie, or the Quad Cinema, to see something as incompetently made as "Alvin and the Chipmunks.''__"Chipwrecked" serves up more of the derivative chaos that floats this franchise's boat.__It's an uninspired and instantly forgettable film. But it completely succeeds by its own standards: an 87-minute rainy-day distraction that will probably make a zillion dollars.__Maybe for the next installment, they can go off to college and find something better to do than making these silly movies.__There is chipmunk gambling. There is seductive dancing by Chipettes wearing only towels. There is a musical gag involving the lyric "whip my tail back and forth."__If only they were truly stranded on that desert island...__Good news: The shrill CG rodents, who last infested theaters in 2009's Squeakquel, are stranded on a jungle island with little hope of survival. Bad news: They've brought us along.__You know there is something wrong with a movie when even David Cross in a giant pelican suit isn't funny.__Either the "Alvin and the Chipmunks" movies are getting better, or I've accidentally buried my brain for the winter.__Eighty-seven minutes, the duration of this auditory assault, would be sufficient to slaughter every brain cell and induce blithering idiocy.__Largely inoffensive but equally unimaginative.__In between the cutesy musical covers (from the Go-Go's to Lady Gaga), the young rodents engage in harmless slapstick and even learn a bit about themselves.__In the end, I'd rather hang onto fond memories of my Eisenhower-era record, squeaky voices and all.__87 minutes of high-pitched singing, shenanigans, bad behaviour and family bonding, enlivened by a decent Sarah Palin joke.__Even by the exceedingly lenient standards of second sequels to terrible kids' films, Chipwrecked feels particularly arbitrary and devoid of inspiration.__For kids, familiarity, silliness and Dave's unconditional love make it appealing. For adults, the best it has to offer are nostalgia and a running time under 90 minutes.__Well, at least it isn't in 3D.
Super 8 is accomplished commercial filmmaking.__A diverting but rather pointless affair, undermined by its obsessive and clinical commitment to recreating past glories.__Spielberg and Abrams are the unwitting targets of their own irony.__A love letter to a cinematic era, before 'blockbuster' became a synonym for 'franchise' or 'tent pole.'__Remember the good old days? This is the movie you went to see on a Saturday afternoon in the good old days.__There's much to like in this story of a group of young movie-makers who stumble upon an event right out of, well, the movies.__If Abrams had stuck with the kids and cut way back on all the sci-fi hoo-ha, his film might have stood a fighting chance of being charming. Big is not always better, even when it comes to fantasies.__Abrams remembers the simple rule that a majority of his contemporaries have forgotten: action and mayhem have meaning only when an audience cares about the people trapped within the maelstrom.__This may not be a children's classic that will last for generations, but it will make for a rollicking afternoon at the multiplex for kids around Joe's age.__Abrams' imitation is a shade too reverent for my taste. He lacks the subversive edge that allowed Joe Dante to bite his producer's hand and bring Gremlins to life, for example, and Abrams seems unsure just how scary he wants things to get.__Abrams fashions Super 8 in such a calculating manner, with every element weighed both for maximum nostalgia value and ironic hipster cred, that it has an artificial feel to it. It's like a birthday cake made of spun glass.__This sci-fi thriller has an engrossing plot and a strong cast of fully drawn characters. There's even a sweet youthful love story. In other words, it's a summer blockbuster firing on all cylinders.__The result is a sci-fi monster movie that keeps its sense of fun and humanity. It's a valentine to a classically American genre -- the B-movie -- and a nostalgic look back on a more innocent time.__This new film isn't perfect, and may not be a world-changer, but it's certainly a world-pleaser.__It's the child actors, heroic indeed, who rescue Super 8 from the blockbuster grip of its adult makers.__For pretty much the first half of the new movie from writer-director J.J. Abrams, Super 8 isn't really even an alien thriller; it's a sad-sweet tale of loss and coming-of-age set in the golden-gone days of the late '70s.__The worst that can be said about the film is that the characters are far more compelling than the mystery they solve.__Its pleasures are borrowed, but durable.__Attempts the difficult feat of balancing self-consciousness about the olden days with wide-eyed, headlong, present-tense fun. For about an hour it succeeds marvelously. The modest letdown that follows exposes the limitations of Mr. Abrams's imagination.__Has moments of greatness, but the ending is a slight disappointment.
Just when you thought you'd seen everything, here comes Chinatown, the animated version.__Though young children may enjoy it, the film is built for viewers of any age with a taste for joyful anarchy.__The first animated film from ILM is also the first memorable motion picture of 2011.__Adults and slightly older children should have a great time.__A CGI western comedy populated by desert critters, Rango gives the film year a belated jump start with a passel of movie-wise fun and a knockout animation style.__With his first animated feature, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski shows ambitions considerably beyond producing the usual standard of most children's fare. To put it plainly, Rango is one weird movie.__Yes, [there are] enough nods to other sources to make Rango a bobblehead. But the movie, and much of John Logan's writing, is still pretty durn clever.__The best of Rango is a lot like the best of the first Pirates movie -- crazily funny and rambunctious.__What elevates it above a cheeky romp is the skilled CGI work, not only the wealth of tactile detail lavished on the parched townsfolk but also the painterly, sand-swept vistas they call home.__Rango's not just a kiddie-flick (though it has enough silly slapstick to qualify as a pretty good one). It's a real movie lover's movie, conceived as a Blazing Saddles-like comic commentary on genre that's as back-lot savvy as it is light in the saddle.__An ultra-quirky animated Western with a vocal tour de force by Johnny Depp that's quite unlike anything I've ever seen.__A sun-baked symphony of rust and dust, Rango has a spiky, unsentimental appeal, sending out slightly risque jokes to parents while staying safely out of the danger zone for kids.__The whole enterprise is redolent of past movies (and drug trips), yet it somehow whiffs fresh.__Without double-crossing the kiddie contingent, "Rango" is iconic like a spaghetti Western, smart like a '70s conspiracy thriller and lively like a Coen brothers comedy.__The film itself is a magically strange hybrid, a spoofy computer-animated Western acted out by anthropomorphic desert creatures.__It is not self-conscious knowingness that drives Rango but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers' heads over the years.__Every other week, it seems there is some new creation full of fantastically realized creatures engaging in eye-tricking action. The ironic effect of this... is a so-what-else-you-got state of jaded exhaustion. And then along comes Rango.__I've made a good case for seeing "Rango," and why not; an eye feast is still a feast in this lean multiplex season.__Its strong suit is visual panache. It's too bad that consistent comedy and emotional resonance get lost amid the dust and cacti.__Say what you will about 'Rango,' the computer-animated Western riding hard on Johnny Depp doing the voice of a lizard - just don't call it business as usual.
Gordon knows what works and what doesn't, pushing the leads' chummy chemistry to the fore while allowing the schematic and, frankly, highly unlikely murder plot to sink into the background.__The movie's main thrust is lowball wish fulfillment, which comes too cheaply.__A lot of low-stakes humor, occasionally brought off by a mostly ingratiating cast.__For something like Horrible Bosses to sparkle, the actors have to shine... and shine they do.__The coarseness wouldn't be so bad if at least the steady stream of obscenities were funny. But there is, after all, an art to talking dirty.__Horrible Bosses offers a reminder that adherence to formula may not be among the signal virtues of comedy, but--provided the jokes are funny--it's no great vice either.__As they say, the best laid plans go oft awry. So what transpires in a comedy about the worst-laid schemes? These guys don't seem built for premeditated murder but are perfectly capable of mayhem.__Still, Day's scene involving a mountain of cocaine is hyperspeed-hilarious, Farrell's unhinged, irrational fuming is marvelously cretinous, and Aniston's fully committed sex-addict sexpot act is wickedly absurd.__Horrible Bosses takes a dark premise -- three buddies band together to off their bosses -- and rings it for a solid, steady stream of laughs.__The screenplay is a hit and miss; but there are some laughs.__What's right about Horrible Bosses is less easy to identify, but it comes down to something like esprit de corps.__The smartest thing about "Horrible Bosses" is that it both refuses to just clock in and waste time - and, at the same time, works extra hard to hold our attention.__Bits that could have courted actual darkness a la Very Bad Things-violence, venality, vindictive sex-simply register as dank shock-jock gags done with little courage, and even less conviction.__There's an underlying, nearly universal relatability to "Horrible Bosses" that can't be denied and that screenwriters Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein use to great advantage.__It's over-the-top stuff, to be sure. But Bosses never crosses that line into the macabre. Don't call in sick to this shift.__Look at how crazy is the craziness we are doing for you. Isn't it crazy? the movie shouts, and the more it does, the less you'll laugh.__A jubilant, vulgar, and extremely funny farce.... Day, Sudeikis, and Bateman are a dream team of comic actors.__The talented cast and colorful vulgarities work overtime to cover for a lack of coherence, but they can only distract for so long.__Basically, "Horrible Bosses" is a handful of characters and a comic situation in search of something to do for 100 minutes.__Watching good actors let their hair down can be fun, but watching them let their standards down isn't.
How many more of these superheroes can we take?__He's an ambiguously...heroic hero.__Apart from having no particular reason to exist onscreen, especially at these prices, it's not half bad.__The result makes the movie seem assembled from bits and pieces of other superhero yarns rather than existing on a plane of its own.__The superhero genre is the home-court of the underdog, of skinny Peter Parkers and mutant outcasts, of heroes born from pain or ingenuity. In Green Lantern, the rich get richer.__Even by the standards of the current run of mediocre comic-book movies, this one stands out for its egregious shoddiness.__As a disjointed rumble in the cosmos, it's both too much and too little, and too dorky looking. In this case, Green means stop.__At least the filmmakers acknowledge that Reynolds in green tights and mask still looks like his non-Green Lantern alter ego, cocky test pilot Hal Jordan. There's none of this Clark Kent/Superman silliness.__It's almost as if no one cared to try hard enough to tell a coherent and engaging story.__[The] movie groans with the strain of explaining who Green Lantern is, while also trying to sell the movie as a big, eye-popping summer entertainment. What gets sacrificed on the altar of this new franchise launch is any real sense of fun.__Neither amusing nor exciting enough to ensure a long-running franchise.__A relentlessly silly superhero flick with eyeball-rolling dialogue - set in vast, familiar-looking digital realms that look like rejected models from the second "Star Wars" trilogy.__Lantern rarely taps the charm Reynolds has shown in previous films. Consequently, it's hard to imagine why the nebulous Corps chose a cypher such as Hal as its savior.__The result is a deadly disappointment, despite Ryan Reynolds's cocky, muscle-flexing charisma.__Half-campy, half-compelling.__Green Lantern opens with the words "Billions of years ago..." Take that as a sign of just how much time this ostensible action movie spends explaining itself.__"Green Lantern" is purely a popcorn movie for 12-year-olds, who won't be disappointed.__More science-fiction space opera than superhero epic, it works in fits and starts as its disparate parts go in and out of effectiveness, but the professionalism of the production make it watchable in a comic book kind of way.__Apart from some spiffy visual effects, which create coherent, scary textures and architecture for outer space, Green Lantern is the most generic of summer time wasters.__Mr. Sarsgaard succeeds in creating a real guy with real passions. Apart from him there's nada.
Kids will love Brand's frenetic drumming take on E.B., adults will love that there are a few clandestine adult jokes.__As fake and forgettable as a marshmallow Peep, "Hop" goes down easy enough. It's the thought of a talented actor stuck on an industry conveyor belt that leaves an unfortunate aftertaste.__Though the integration of live action and animation is improving (especially a scene where E.B. cuddles with Fred's sister), it's still a slightly disorienting experience.__Hop is just too shrill, slick and sickly sweet for anybody's good. Watching it won't rot your teeth, but it could leave an ugly cavity in your brain.__A fun and funny mix of live action and animation that puts the hop back into Easter.__Hop integrates animated characters into live-action settings, relying on director Tim Hill to handle the logistics of convincingly blending both worlds.__It's supposed to be sweet, but "Hop" is a headache waiting to happen.__Presented with the opportunity to do the first-ever big-budget Easter bunny flick mixing live action and animation, "Hop" gives us . . . a bunny who poops jelly beans.__It offers a glimmer of amusement, but only to kids still young enough to believe in the Easter Bunny.__A fairly undistinguished but pleasant and easy-to-take holiday movie, with slow spots and silly spots and a handful of moments of inspiration.__Hop will win audiences over with its goofy charm.__The whole thing raises questions of the type it is almost embarrassing to contemplate; it's almost like "Donnie Darko," for little kids.__All in all, it's hard to know for whom "Hop" is made.__The only thing missing is any real wonder, imagination or comic verve.__"Hop" is hip. And sassy, speedy and slick. It's that rarest of surprises, a movie for kids that transcends age barriers.__Brand does manage to play an obnoxious creature with a kind of charm. He feels like the only person who doesn't need this movie.__Anyone bewailing the near-absence of tacky family films inspired by Easter need bewail no more: Hop has arrived to fill the void.__Smaller kids will think E.B. is real, older kids will be bored by the story and adults will think David Hasselhoff must really need the money.__...the almost willfully brain-dead tone of Hop began trying my patience right off the bat.__If you're 12 or younger, you'll think it's hilarious. If you don't? It's going to be a long 95 minutes.
Joost and Schulman sustain a consistent sense of dread, playing with our own fears of things that go bump in the night.__If you haven't seen the first two movies, why are you watching this? And if you have seen the first two movies, why do you need to watch this?__Series creator Oren Peli and his conscripts have managed to do it again, but you have to wonder how far they can continue to push this found-footage angle.__The shtick movie "Paranormal Activity 3" is the horror equivalent of vaudeville comedy: a little patter, a little pie in the face, repeat.__This third Paranormal is a prequel that occasionally goes off the rails but also offers more laughs and somewhat more character development than the previous installments.__It ... brings fake-out jolts and humor into play.__Far and away the sharpest, most wildly aware film in the series.__There's something to be said for giving people what they want, but in genre movieland, that strategy droops into lazy cynicism quicker than you can say Saw 3D.__"Paranormal Activity 3'' has no interest in art. It just wants to give you the willies with a minimum of gore and a maximum of camcorder dread, and it succeeds.__There are only so many times bodies can be dragged out of frame and tables levitated before the biggest scare of all is the threat of tedium.__If the goal is to generate howls of both laughter and terror, Paranormal Activity 3 falls short. It's too by-the-numbers.__The Paranormal Activity movies are built on fundamental horror concepts, and those fundamentals still hold.__Two movies later, even die-hard supporters are going to find all this stuff dully familiar.__The filmmakers throw in a few cheesy scares: mom in a monster mask, a baby sitter jumping in front of a camera. But the rest is pretty freaking cool.__"Paranormal" reveals itself for what it has become, the "Saw" of found video thrillers.__It's not so much a movie as it is a cinematic cardio exam, with directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the guys who made "Catfish," pounding away again and again to see how much your heart can take.__Inexplicably, there are people who still haven't had enough of these movies. The first was a nifty novelty. Now the appeal has worn threadbare.__The bottom line, for me, is this: I don't scare easily at horror films (that's one of the reasons I tend to pan them), but I watched Paranormal Activity 3 in a state of high anxiety.__Still, cheap it may be, but it's not particularly graphic, so it's got that going for it. And in any case, scares are scares, even if they are cheap.__Although not exactly breaking any new ground with its by now all too familiar found-footage format, Paranormal Activity 3 hews to the formula in expertly crafted fashion, mustering up the requisite scares and then some.
Jennifer Aniston has starred in so many lame romantic comedies that she's become an industry punch line, but drop her into an Adam Sandler movie and she comes off like Katharine Hepburn.__The central conceit serves the new version well enough, despite the filmmakers' regrettable addition of sundry idiotic distractions.__An egregiously unfunny enterprise that seem less crafted than extruded through the great product-mill that is Hollywood at its most homogenized and soulless.__Amidst the wreckage of Just Go With It, Aniston and Sandler have a real chemistry. They should go elsewhere with it.__It's all ridiculous, of course, but it's meant to be.__Sandler has mellowed into an appealingly garlicky, old-school mensch, and Aniston, as a self-sacrificingly practical woman in a race against time, is a genre unto herself.__The experience of sitting through Just Go with It, Adam Sandler's umpteenth comedy directed by good buddy Dennis Dugan, is akin to watching a bad sit-com that never ends.__Adam Sandler plays a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon in Just Go With It, a fumbling comedy directed by Dennis Dugan that could have benefitted from surgical reconstruction. How about some liposuction to siphon off all those lame jokes?__In Funny People, it took a brush with terminal illness for Sandler to rediscover his craft and his self-respect. One can't help but wonder what it might take in real life.__An early contender for worst movie of the year. If they were showing this on an airplane, I'd as for a parachute.__Sandler should know better.__Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston's romantic comedy, idiotic even by their usually low big-screen standards, is stuffed with unpleasant narcissists saying and doing the stupidest, often cruelest things in hope of cheap laughs.__Eeryone should be offended by the time-annihilating suckage of this mirth void.__Don't even think of going with it. It's the perfect Valentine's date night movie, but only with someone you hate.__Sandler and Aniston easily pass the only important test of romantic comedies: We like them and want them to like each other. If only the other cast members were as good.__Once again the hoary and apparently ineffable question comes up: Why won't Hollywood remake movies that actually need redoing?__All in all, the hit-to-miss ratio of Just Go With It is not so terrible. Which is not to say the movie is anything special.__Aniston, taking her cues from her costar, doesn't expend much energy either, but there are glimmers of comic brio. Now and then, she makes a face that suggests she might actually be having some fun.__A very funny romantic comedy that nicely combines Adam Sandler's acerbic sweetness with Aniston's down-to-earth warmth - and that finds an excuse for Aniston to both play an average person and yet dress like a movie star.__When Adam Sandler isn't making bathroom jokes or talking like a 2-year-old with a sinus infection, the guy can be disarming.
It's certainly worth seeing if you missed the original. If you saw it, however, there's no way of unseeing it, and nothing in the new one to top it.__Fincher's Dragon Tattoo is a faithful adaptation that brings the dazzle but shortchanges on the daring... It's gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark.__What he has delivered is adequate, but it doesn't have any flavor - and of all the things Fincher is, "bland" is not usually one of them.__David Fincher's adaptation of the international best-seller is a triumph of craftsmanship over material.__An altogether leaner, meaner, more high-powered, stylish, and deftly directed affair, though similarly hampered by a too-long narrative fuse.__Even Fincher's elegantly gruesome style can't turn this Swedish noir into the meditation on evil and corruption that it fancies itself to be.__Provides all the jolts and forward motion that any good airport novel gives you, but it's the film equivalent of the book that kept you awake from Chicago to Baltimore, only you don't feel bad about leaving it on the seat next to you after you land.__When it comes down to it, this is Rooney Mara's movie, and I don't care if the second and third stories are any good as long as they are full of Lisbeth Salander.__This is what a movie adaptation should be: a film whose base narrative has its roots in the source material but whose soul can be identified through the images that unfold on screen.__I don't think I've seen an actor do more with deadpan expressions than Mara does in this movie. Her face doesn't move but, whether she's tasing a man or standing in front of a mirror watching a cigarette dangle from her mouth, we respond to her.__Mara's Lisbeth can be brashly young and impossibly smart. It's a performance that should well serve the upcoming sequels.__Mara's bristling, unbridled performance gives the film the ballast it needs to pull off that curious, undeniably engrossing, balancing act.__The Swedish version was sloppier and trashier, which suited the material. If that movie was more lurid, it also packed more genuine emotion.__It's stylish, if not exactly subtle, and daringly brutal for a Hollywood movie. It's also so uneven and overlong that it may leave non-fans wondering what all the fuss has been about.__This Dragon flies, but it never really breathes fire.__The kick in this material, especially in this new version which plays down Mikael's surliness, is Lisbeth, a pixieish polysexual outlier who seems equipped with her own portable storm cloud.__Seeing Fincher's version is like getting a Christmas gift of a book you already have.__The dynamic between Craig and Mara in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so sensational, it instantly propels the movie beyond glossy, high-toned pulp into something far more affecting.__This is an ingenious and engrossing work of pop cinema. That said, when it was over I felt a wave of ennui wash over me upon reflecting that we've got two more of these to go.__A solidly crafted, creepily suspenseful thriller.
If you can see past the dismal sexual politics of "Bad Teacher," which I couldn't, you might applaud the gall of a film that expends so little effort in forcing us to like its central character.__A frustrating mix of smart flash and smirking impudence.__Hard to root for such a selfish lead, but "Bad Teacher" has just enough politically incorrect humor to warrant a grade of B.__If you're looking for a funny comedy about a cynical, hard-partying school teacher transformed by his students into a paragon of pedagogical awesomeness, skip Bad Teacher and go rent School of Rock instead.__There are plenty of quality gags seeping through from the margins.__Has its lewd funniness, though not often enough to make it worthy of not only Bad Santa but, more to the point, School of Rock.__Everyone loves an anti-hero, but usually there's something redeeming about the character that makes you want to root for them in the end. Not so much in Bad Teacher.__The best lines were harvested for the trailer -- so if you've seen that, you've seen it all.__Shame the flick's just a one-note joke because, sight unseen, Bad Teacher had me at the title.__The film is fast and often funny. And while it's not for children - really - I bet the adults who just spent a school year with them are going to love it.__This fitfully funny but mostly dull misfire defines exactly where the line can be drawn between truly subversive humor and lazy cynicism.__As film school assignments go, Bad Teacher is a potentially "A" topic with a "C" result that would require considerable remedial writing to upgrade.__A fitfully amusing comedy that promises far more outrageousness than it actually delivers.__"Bad Teacher" immediately brings "Bad Santa" to mind and suffers by the comparison.__Diaz performs with gusto, but the screenplay doesn't give her many funny things to say.__The film's rhythms are disjointed, and there are tedious patches and gaping holes in the story. No one bothered to create anything beyond a vague outline of a superficial character.__Diaz, costars Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake, and a sharp supporting cast (Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith, Thomas Lennon, John Michael Higgins) manage to deliver a crappy good time, mercifully devoid of any heart-tugging teacher-student subplots.__Have talented actors ever struggled so much to so little avail? Ms. Diaz sells her lines like a street vendor peddling fake Timexes.__We're more concerned with the mock-shock screenplay futilely in search of a story, and the characters that could have been created on an Etch A Sketch.__Ms. Diaz has found her down-and-dirty element in the kind of broad comedy that threatens to get ugly and more or less succeeds on that threat.
What started as 'True Grit'-meets-'War of the Worlds' ends up closer to - whisper it - 'Wild Wild West'.__Takes itself much too seriously, with acts of brutality outnumbering the gags.__It's fun to think about what Cowboys & Aliens might have been if any creativity had crept past the title page.__Cowboys & Aliens is an agreeable time-killer, but I'll bet a couple of clever kids could make a livelier movie with a Woody puppet and a Predator doll.__[A] phenomenally successful two-man war against narrative clarity and continuity.__A film that entertains, even if it doesn't live up to the full-on madness potential the title portended.__It's just big silly fun, the kind you're supposed to have at a summer movie with a ridiculous title.__The small moments of poetry ... are lost amid too much digital sound and fury.__Over on the aliens side, it's hard to make out faces, but there's no doubt about their place of origin: These slimy, growling, bug-eyed and distinctly non-scary things are straight from central casting.__Characters are so sketchily drawn that little is really at stake here.__Nothing very exciting happens.__It may be two treats in one, but for an audience that's pigged out on spectacle all summer, that might be two treats too many.__The movie gets by on the strength of agreeable talent who enjoy playing along and can endure the horse manure and space goo being shovelled.__This sharp-looking, committee-written adaptation of a genre-splicing graphic novel wins points by frequently, smartly and affectionately tipping its hat to classic Westerns and their archetypes.__It's hard to say what is most depressing about "Cowboys & Aliens" - the film itself, or the fact that this was the best movie a posse of major Hollywood players could come up with.__A crowd-pleasing summer movie with more wit than most.__A stultifying pileup of nonsense and stupidity, with way too many cowboys (and Indians and Mexicans and a scrappy mutt and a cute, brave orphan) and not nearly enough aliens.__Favreau's film doesn't take any risks, reducing the stakes to the point where the movie descends quickly from its fun exposition to a collection of meaningless explosions and predictable action sequences.__The storytelling, punctuated by incoherent flashbacks, is often inscrutable: I'm still trying to figure out which side of the cosmos gave birth to the woman played by Olivia Wilde.__There is enough to like and to savor in Cowboys & Aliens that it makes for an enjoyable two hours in the dark with a big bag of buttery popcorn.
"Toy Story" goes Shakespearean in this animated retelling of the tale of the star-crossed lovers of Verona.__Gnomeo & Juliet stays too low to the ground to become an animated classic, but if there's a fairer midwinter's tale, wherefore art thou?__Uneven is the course, as the Bard might say, but the ride is plenty of fun.__Sadly, the music is largely wasted on the material, as somehow gnomes racing a lawnmower doesn't organically translate to a song about fighting and getting a little action in.__Seriously, have most small children here even seen a garden gnome? Outside of a website commercial, maybe, or the cover of Grandpa's old "All Things Must Pass" album?__There's nothing here as clever as you find in Pixar fare, or Dreamwork's successful Shrek franchise, although co-writer/director Kelly Asbury did helm the Oscar-nominated Shrek 2.__What is there to say about a movie that beats its eccentric premise to the ground in the first scene, and doesn't stop?__[A] delightfully silly animated flick, which doesn't wear out its welcome.__Given the size of the writing staff, it's no surprise the script feels like a committee job, overstocked with a high ratio of groan-to-grin quips.__Creator Kelly Asbury has discovered imaginative ways to freshen up the timeless material and introduce it to the next generation.__It's a sorry spectacle, watching garden gnomes being robbed of their dignity.__If the movie, which starts out shakily, improves in the second half, it is a discombobulated grab bag of jokes peopled with characters who have little emotional resonance.__What makes the film most endearing is its unabashed eccentricity.__This lively little film, a comic take on Shakespeare's tragedy, is really entertaining.__Much of the play's dialogue is updated. Jokes fall flat. And a ceramic gnome by any other name is still a kitschy little figure.__If only the 3-D hadn't been wasted on the claustrophobic trappings of a backyard feud.__Playful, inventive and endearing, this 84-minute epic is smart enough not to overstay its welcome as it steers clear of the fatuous and the formulaic.__Defiantly derivative and groaning from joke overload, this Disney pickup takes more than half its running time to find a distinctive tone, a reason for being.__Are we in such a hurry to introduce preschool kids to "Romeo and Juliet" that they need to see a computer-animated, bowdlerized version featuring garden gnomes and a happy ending?__As enjoyable as non-Pixar kiddie flicks get, a high-spirited, high-end comic revamp of Big Bill's eternal tragedy.
[It] clocks in at a bloated 118 minutes. There is not, I promise you, 118 minutes worth of vital plot, special effects or comic business in this movie.__Part origin story, part spoof, part bromance -- the movie can't decide. It winks at itself constantly, but only to hide its cluelessness.__A facetious industrial product, and the first out-and-out bore of the year.__Despite its obvious angling to become a franchise, this Green Hornet offers little that's worth committing to even the "cult flick" chamber of your brain.__The Green Hornet doesn't seem worth the outrageous 3-D-glasses surcharge. In all senses, there's little that jumps out at you.__Can a genius and an average Joe pair up and put egos aside to serve mindless adventure? Gondry and Rogen have.__There are elements of a sharp hero/sidekick inversion here: Kato is the handsome, brilliant inventor and karate expert; Britt is, well, rich enough to pay the salary of someone like Kato. But the inversion is inevitably incomplete.__A big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie.__Here's a 3-D movie that should have been shot in Zero-D.__The big-screen Green Hornet, while hardly classic comic-book filmmaking, ain't half bad.__Seth Rogen is the Green Hornet. What else do you need to know?__Once you get to the fiends and fights that make a comic book movie really work, things go stale.__An anemic, 97-pound weakling of the action comedy persuasion, "Hornet" is a boring bromedy that features mumblecore heroics instead of the real thing.__Michel Gondry has crafted an irreverently funny, ultramodern take on the 1930s radio serial, with a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put his feet up on the seat next to you.__There might be a funny movie in a story about a crime fighter who's in it only for the publicity, but "The Green Hornet" isn't it.__Quite a bit less than the sum of its appealing parts.__There's simply no center here, no sense that someone is guiding the ship.__There's nothing here but a concept and a marketing and merchandising strategy, at the center of which somebody - oh, no - had to come up with an actual movie.__Even as a mindless diversion, it's weak.__This morning, the unconscious bodies of three pickpockets were found in front of the Post's offices. Safety-pinned to one was an envelope containing the following movie review.
The Lion King, complete with jaunty songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, is undeniably and fully worthy of its glorious Disney heritage. It is a gorgeous triumph -- one lion in which the studio can take justified pride.__Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers (composed by Elton John and Tim Rice) and silly, rambunctious comedy.__It's perhaps the closest Disney has come to creating a consciously mythical entertainment in the style of Star Wars. Yet like that film it keeps its sense of humor and fun.__Even with its flaws, this latest Disney animated feature once again delivers what its audience wants. Too bad flesh and blood films can't be this consistent.__It bears repeating that The Lion King is quite entertaining as children's fare goes these days. But Disney has established a standard so high on animated features that anything less than a classic leaves you feeling that something's missing.__The rest of The Lion King alternates between grand-opera melodrama and low-comedy hi-jinks, superbly blending the two approaches.__Everyone, young and old, will find something to appreciate in this Shakespearean tale of a young lion discovering his rightful place in the world.__The story line is a Joseph Campbell hero-quest so stripped down to its basics as to become dull.__A computer-animated scene featuring a stampede of wildebeest is positively breathtaking.__The Lion King, more than any of the recent wave of Disney animated features, has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie.__The result is a step toward multiculturalism and ecological correctness, though not without a certain amount of confusion.__Songs variable. Animation staggering. A winner.__A crown jewel of modern Disney animation.__More so than the exuberant movie miracles that came before it, this latest animated juggernaut has the feeling of a clever, predictable product.__A royal treat.__Some of the richest imagery the studio's animators have produced and held together.__There clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons,' they have succeeded.__It's all calculated to be wonderfully entertaining and almost every frame hits the mark.__An ingenious mixture of themes from narrative sources as ancient and varied as Hamlet, the Old Testament and The Odyssey.__A superbly drawn animated feature.
A film bursting at the seams with sheer, unadulterated joy: watch it, and the world seems just that little bit brighter...__It may not entirely work as a movie, but The Muppets shines as a piece of touching pop nostalgia.__The purity of the nostalgia turns this franchise film into a love letter to childhood.__You can rest easy - if you have previously loved the Muppets, you will likely currently love The Muppets.__The chorus of one of the songs declares, 'I've got everything that I need, right in front of me.' For 120 minutes, that's precisely how I felt.__[Filmmakers] hew close to the essential innocence informing the Muppets' silliness.__The Muppets is a triumph of simplicity, innocence and goofy jokes. It's a triumph of felt.__A mixed bag then: The Muppets isn't the best or the worst of Kermit's big-screen capers. At least it's a reminder that here's one frog who isn't about to croak.__It's nice to see the band back together. And when Kermit busts out the banjo for "Rainbow Connection," you might even go for your lighter.__Like Statler and Waldorf, older viewers may kvetch and cavil about the details, but when that red velvet curtain goes up, we wouldn't give up our balcony seats for the world.__No fourth wall is safe in The Muppets, and that's a great piece of news.__The Muppet charm, always more at home within the intimate frame of a TV set, is gone here.__Segel and his team are not Jim Henson -- but they've done justice to the lovers and the dreamers.__Is it perfect? No. Is it a lot of fun and does it successfully revive this inspired franchise? Absolutely and let's seriously hope so. A world without Kermit is just too hard to face.__Except for a few good zingers from balcony dwellers Statler and Waldorf, there isn't much here for mom and dad.__During the movie's best moments, I recalled exactly what my long-gone father's roars of laughter sounded like.__"The Muppets" is both a delightful family film about the Muppets and a winking, self-referential satire about how lame the Muppets are.__The Muppets treats its titular heroes with affection and respect, even as Fozzie Bear shows off his "fart shoes" and toilet humor abounds.__The Muppet relaunch is as it should be: the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational treat you could wish for on a holiday weekend.__The Muppet franchise is revitalized with "The Muppets," a funny, wickedly self-aware musical that opens by acknowledging they've outlived their shelf life.
Its remote-controlled emotional responses leave little room for genuine uplift.__Satisfyingly sturdy and no-nonsense, a multiplex monster smartly constructed from tried-and-trusted parts.__Thanks to an admittedly corny script, some amazing fight scenes, and a terrific cast, "Real Steel's" actually a winner by split decision.__Surely a story as elementary and essentially derivative as this one could be told in less than 127 minutes.__They should call this overloud, underwhelming movie Real Steal.__Real Steel, a heartwarming sci-fi sports movie about a father and son who reunite through robot boxing, testifies to the formidable power of ridiculousness.__Aas the plot proceeds from boy-meets-dad verbal sparring to an uneasy peace to the underdog-vs.- champion title bout, it becomes increasingly easy to forgive its many nicks.__Real Steel is a blast, an unabashed crowd-pleaser that mixes Rocky, Transformers, video games and father-son bonding to great, if corny, effect.__The story remains sadly mired in botdom, which leads to some boredom.__It's 10 percent lovable underdog hokum, 23 percent sentimental family drama and 67 percent rivet-popping punch-ups.__What it lacks is the human element. Charlie is more of a rat than a rascal, and instead of working hard to build and operate his robots, he's literally going through the motions.__A slightly soggy tale of father-son bonding, crossed with an action-adventure flick about high-tech battle-bots.__It's so virtual, so distant from the thrill, that you wonder what the point is. Do you really want to pay to watch an actor playing a kid who in turn plays what amounts to a video game?__Feels as if it were made inside the mind of a kid obsessed with robots.__While the sappy boy-and-his-robot drama pales next to the terrific "The Iron Giant," the actual 'bot battles are vicarious fun.__[Real Steel] borrows so much from other films that it might better be titled Reel Steal: not only from The Champ, but from Rocky, the Transformers movies and even some Star Wars.__There's nothing real about Real Steel except its shameless desire to please by going where better and more successful movies have gone before.__You've probably seen toy commercials that present a more thoughtful dystopian future. And yet, in the moment, this film will make you want to do nothing except stuff your face with more.__Though the premise of fighting robots does seem a plausible and intriguing extension of the contemporary WWE world, Real Steel is hampered by leaden, cliched moments in which a stubborn boy teaches his childish father a valuable lesson.__Real Steel is ridiculous, but it is not dispiriting. If you're going to make this movie, it should be made just this way, with commitment, verve and a complete disregard for physics, robotics and environmentalism.
This is witless, saccharine and lifeless...__There's strong, fleetingly powerful stuff in Crazy, Stupid, Love., but like its awkwardly punctuated title, the movie jerks to a halt just when it's beginning to flow.__It gets better and funnier after a labored and lumbering start, which is entirely the opposite of most Hollywood comedies.__This is not the ultimate romantic comedy - the one that makes you fall as hard for the characters as they do for one another while savoring their every interaction - but it seems fresher and less recycled than much of the product out there.__This is the sort of film that Oscar generally ignores come awards season. It shouldn't. Crazy Stupid Love is a crazy smart film.__The directors show a great talent for jagged-edged farce.__During a summer when most of the other romantic comedies haven't been either, "Crazy, Stupid, Love" provides a fairly smart and sensible date-night choice.__It's romantic, touching, a little risque and screwball, yet reassuringly down-to-earth.__[A] pleasant surprise.__I laughed all the way through, thanks to both consistently clever dialogue and deft delivery from Carell and Gosling, who clearly relished a chance to flex his comic muscles.__The movie squanders its potential with a sloppy script chock full of false notes. Even the bumptious score intrudes, often bumping into important dialogue.__Adult dramas and comedies should at least have a toe in their audience's lives.__Pity the crowds expecting another cute comedy like "Date Night" who wind up at "Crazy, Stupid, Love." It'll be like asking for a burger and getting served escargot.__A multi-threaded and well-organized comedy full of pleasant surprises and appealing characters.__"Crazy, Stupid, Love" is, on balance, remarkably sane and reasonably smart.__Carell carries the comedy, while remaining grounded in the pain of the character, and so we care. It's also astonishing what good clothes and a haircut can do for a guy. There's a lesson in that for all of us.__Fills its scenes with bright surprises while making an appealing new case for the old-fashioned notion of soul mates.__Sorry, dudes. It seems we can't do anything right, but we're still funny. Sometimes.__This grand romantic gesture about grand romantic gestures conjures up the bittersweet magic of first loves, lasting loves, lost loves and all the loves in between.__In a genre where outright imbecility generally prevails, a film investigating craziness and stupidity qualifies as a cut above.
Terminally stupid.__If the talk had been surgically removed, leaving only the sights and sounds of combat, this could have been a striking, semiabstract display of aggressive energy; as it is, any viewer over twelve will go for the laughs.__Excitement? Not so much.__With his hawklike profile and square jaw, the hyperstalwart Eckhart looks like a comic-book hero and acts like one, too. He's so stalwart he creaks.__This film feels so much like a videogame your hands keep reaching for controllers -- shoot the aliens, shoot the aliens, shoot the aliens.__Don't mean to boast, but I can suspend my disbelief as willingly as any credulous moviegoer. Yet not even an industrial crane would have helped here. Nope, Battle: Los Angeles completely defeated me.__This silly extraterrestrial-invasion epic somehow manages the feat of making the destruction of La La Land seem tedious.__H.G. Wells did it better. This movie spends so much yawn-inducing time on variations of the same combat scenario that its final showdown feels rushed.__As it lurches from Act II to Act III, "Battle: Loss Angeles" reveals itself to be a lousy movie.__Eckhart's commitment to the movie's reality, which is as fierce as the sergeant's commitment to his men, takes what otherwise might merely have been outlandish and makes it believable, and frightening.__Battle takes its fight so seriously that it's hard to get behind the mission.__As it stands, Battle: Los Angeles is good dumb fun. A little less talking and a little weirder alien and it might have been something more.__Like an angry tenant bent on revenge, the movie industry has depicted the destruction of Los Angeles with staggering consistency if not a wealth of imagination.__You can't help but wish there had been a lot more heart in this Marine's story.__The film, constructed by people of serious talent, is designed to put you through the wringer, and that's exactly what it does. This is a total war scenario, people. Man up or stand back. Hoo-rah!__A loud, frenetic, viscerally gripping two-hour tour of duty that mostly plays fair by the rules of the genre and mostly avoids macho posturing.__Battle: Los Angeles draws entirely on cliches ... And they're all shouted at top volume.__As a narrative, the cartoonish Battle: Los Angeles makes the cartoonish Independence Day look as nuanced as Saving Private Ryan.__It's like watching other people play a video game__Disaster films will really get interesting when they start running out of iconic skylines to destroy. How about "Battle: Wichita" or "Deep Impact: Albany"?
__Without any narrative heft, these sights don't last in the mind much longer than they linger on screen. And yet they thrill in short-lived bursts that Singh doles out carefully, keeping pace with the audience's appetite.__When Hyperion says of one character, "His pain has just begun,'' you know exactly how he feels.__The same hyperstylized, comic book-come-to-life approach that created an invigorating experience for viewers of 300 elevates Immortals above the level of a Clash of the Titans knock-off.__The posters read "From the Producers of 300" and, like Zack Snyder's film, Immortals has little on its mind but conveying the buzz of martial glory.__This monumental tale of warring gods and men is a beautiful, dead thing, bereft of organic or kinetic life.__Singh is a talented and eccentric visual artist with no creative future in the movie business.__As mythic spectacles go, it beats Clash Of The Titans, particularly in the areas of intimidating villainy and actual Titan-clashing.__Solid yet hardly sensational, no luxury sedan but a good compact -- fairly efficient in its operation, typically clean in look, and guaranteed to reach its destination with a minimum of fuss.__The movie's landscape is a disappointingly barren digital domain, the same gray cliffs, deserts and seas familiar from 300 and so many game-worlds.__Puffed-up style worthy of trumped-up lore.__It's a movie about myth with no sense of magic.__The pity is that Tarsem's intelligence doesn't connect his cinematic eye to his narrative mind. The director's visual gift is like a brilliant retina, detached.__As in his "The Fall," director Tarsem Singh's visual instincts overwhelm his storytelling finesse.__If it's violence ye seek, and violently confused storytelling, look ye no further.__"The Immortals" is without doubt the best-looking awful movie you will ever see.__Where are the gods of Olympus when you need them? I ask on behalf of "Immortals," because mere mortals were apparently not able to create a movie that actually made sense.__Logic melts away completely and the pic's raison d'etre emerges -- namely, to justify staging a fight scene for the ages.__Visually stunning, but heavy-handed and lacking a single moment that evinces any relish for movie-making.__Sing to me, O Muse, of gods and men, of timeless legends and forgettable retreads. Speak of "Immortals," and answer in all seriousness: did you even read that awful script?
The Descendants is humane, decent, and close to real quality.__Payne is an unobtrusive director, a filmmaker who lets the script do the walking - in this case, perhaps too much.__One of the year's best films, a bubbly meditation on family and responsibility that weighs just enough to matter.__In the hands of writer-director Alexander Payne, Clooney has rarely seemed so much at home.__In playing an everyman stranded between anger and duty, Clooney earns an emotional payoff that a lesser actor would simply demand.__With so many balls in the air the temptation is to rush from one plot strand to another, but Payne takes the opposite approach. He also captures the complexity of emotional reactions that grief stirs.__It's Clooney and Woodley's movie, as they become a team before our eyes.__The latest exhibit in Payne's careful dissection of the beached male, which runs from Matthew Broderick's character in "Election" to Jack Nicholson's in "About Schmidt" and Paul Giamatti's in "Sideways."__This mature, well-acted dramatic comedy is deeply satisfying, maybe even cathartic.__A tough, tender, observant, exquisitely nuanced portrait of mixed emotions at their most confounding and profound -- all at play within a deliciously damp, un-touristy Hawaii that's at once lush and lovely to look at.__A splendid comedy-drama about a father coping with his comatose wife and difficult daughters represents high points for George Clooney and Alexander Payne.__Payne has always tended to look at society from the perspective of a curious, puzzled alien, but now the alien has grown moist-eyed and affectionate.__[Clooney] is a movie star who can't shake (and doesn't want to, one suspects) the baggage of that good fortune, yet consistently works to blend into the ensemble for the sake of story. The Descendants gives us his most emotional work to date.__It's more straightforward and sentimental than most Payne films, and at times it lands very close to sitcom territory. But it also has scenes as wrenching and as true as any onscreen this year.__A guaranteed multiple Oscar nominee and the film that cements Alexander Payne as one of the top filmmakers of his generation, The Descendants is nothing short of a masterpiece.__Alexander Payne has been gone so long, it's easy to forget just how good he is. With The Descendants, the director's first feature since 2004's Sideways, he reminds us what we've been missing.__It's such a disappointment that The Descendants -- Alexander Payne's first film after a seven-year hiatus following Sideways -- isn't a better movie than it is.__Alexander Payne has won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay, but you'd never guess that from this clumsily written drama.__This is a modest marvel of a movie.__I can't think of another movie this year that made me laugh or weep harder for the whole lumpy business of being - the compromises and connections that get us through the day and somehow add up to entire lives.
Funniest moments? The outtakes during the closing credits. I rest my case.__I think there should be a subdivision of the ASPCA -- American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Audiences.__Did we mention that things just go better with Kevin James? Well-trodden comedy hooks become strangely more amusing. Goofball physical shtick elicits broader smiles. The bumblingly stupid is made endearing.__Will most audiences mind this? Probably not. Should they? Of course. They deserve better and frankly, so does Kevin James.__Unfortunately, nobody had the good sense to call the comedy authorities and shut this Zookeeper down.__A children's comedy about talking animals that feels as if it were written by children or, perhaps, by talking animals.__It's hard to think of a human finding much to laugh about in this wounded beast.__Casting carries "Zookeeper" over its roughest patches. The vocal guest stars are inspired.__Coraci doesn't impose much discipline, letting some scenes run wild and others peter out, their punch lines dangling.__This one is strictly for James' hard-core fans and anyone wishing to witness the sole appearance of the once-mighty MGM lion on a new feature this year.__Little kids - hence the G rating - and those who think poop-tossing is funny will be amused by Zookeeper. The rest of us are better off not feeding the animals.__As far as complete wastes of time go, "Zookeeper" is not especially offensive.__It's all very ho-hum, though James, who's like Jason Alexander with a touch of Jeremy Piven, is still a schmo you can't help rooting for.__There's no "The" in the title of the Kevin James comedy "Zookeeper," and that lack of a definitive article pretty well encapsulates the generic fat man follies on display here.__There's little to recommend about Zookeeper, a movie that's flat, lacking in surprises and very dull.__If you've been waiting for Hollywood to produce a romantic comedy with a supporting cast made up of talking animals . . . well, no, even then, Zookeeper will let you down.__A comedy whose cliche-embracing stupidity borders on the surrealistic.__The talking animals are wildly child-pleasing, except that much of their talk concerns matters of animal husbandry. Is there such a thing as a hard PG?__It's probably time to stop fretting about Kevin James's movies, and to stop hoping they'll get better.__Zookeeper is arguably one of the better products of the Adam Sandler Death of Cinema Fun Factory -- but that's an accomplishment somewhere on par with "Least Smelly Turd."
Spielberg still manages to surprise and impress.__The trouble here is not so much that Spielberg's film staunchly insists on finding a happy ending even in the calamity of the First World War, but that he slathers it on so thick and leaves so soft an impression.__The material sometimes feels oversugared, though it's also guaranteed to raise a lump in your throat.__Tthe images have what I can only describe as a wonderful texture. They also have intense color: deep gemlike greens and reds, with black shadows out of an old master painting.__We never ask why the production is devoted to an animal while ten million men are dying, but when Spielberg does the story realistically, it seems trivial, even a little daft.__Amid the incomprehensible slaughter, it's a horse that reminds these warriors of their humanity.__A film that may stay in the mind's eye longer than it lingers in the heart.__There isn't a moment in the movie where you don't feel Spielberg's passion, and this time, the film is worthy of his enthusiasm. It's a knockout.__Tonally jarring and structurally disjointed, it's a punishingly long and bumpy ride.__It's almost a great war movie in one direction, and almost a piece of irredeemable cheese in the other, and there you have it.__It's not that a film can't be lighthearted family fare, a gritty war epic and a weepie all at once; the problem is that here, those elements feel strictly compartmentalized -- and calculated.__The result isn't groundbreaking, but it's gratifying.__Robustly entertaining.__The incredible emotive power of this horse and the way in which the filmmakers were able to translate it on-screen are what stay with you.__Call it "lesser Spielberg" and put it alongside Always and Hook.__Spielberg's phenomenal skill for making images remains undiminished. The rows in a piece of knitting dissolve into the furrows in a stony field; men's bodies fly through the air like broken dolls. Some images are too fussed over, but every one is striking.__Those who say they don't make 'em like they used to must now fall silent.__With the exception of a few lovely scenes, it's a hollow and bombastic piece of work, clobbering you over the head with its epic-ness when it's not cinematically yanking at your nosehairs in the hopes that you'll cry.__Yes, this is a Steven Spielberg picture. He directed it and, like Blondie in the old song, he's gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, one way or another.__Sweeping in its style and old-fashioned in its narrative structure, War Horse will likely take its place alongside beloved family films.
You could pick the script apart for impossibilities. But why bother? It's much more enjoyable to shut your brain off and have a good time.__It's scatty and fast paced, and director Neil Burger employs some Gaspar Noe-style, bad-trip CG effects to heighten the mood.__Very limited, actually.__What would you do if you could take a pill and suddenly access 100 percent of your brain power? This is the premise behind Limitless, a sci-fi thriller that looks as if its makers utilized around 30 percent of theirs.__The filmmakers doesn't sweat the fact that Eddie is a chemically enhanced fraud. What scares them is any possibility of alienating the movie's target audience with a downer ending.__Add it all up, including the nifty twist at the end, and what we have here is a fun Hollywood flick with a good head on its shoulders.__Limitless is limited, but intriguing nonetheless.__Limitless may not be as brainy as it would like to think it is, but it's a relatively sharp and surprisingly playful head-trip, a satisfyingly novel twist on mindless entertainment.__If you want a movie with a sermon, well, look somewhere else. But if you want an adrenaline shot to the heart, look here.__Limitless is frustrating, in part, because it could have been much better.__Occasionally skirts greatness and is definitely worth your time. But it could have been much more.__Limitless hits you like an adrenaline rush that will have you saying, "I'll have what he's having."__"Limitless" is a heck of a ride. On the way to its unpredictable (if less than wholly satisfying) conclusion, it is entertaining, a little silly and visually dazzling.__"Limitless" may please a few looking for a shallow fantasy thriller, but won't fire up the synapses of the intellectually demanding.__If you're willing to ignore the many leaps in logic, his fast-paced thriller goes down easy enough with a side of popcorn.__If there were a pill that made people smarter, I'd donate an extra supply to the creators of "Limitless."__"Limitless" only uses 15, maybe 20 percent of its brain. Still, that's more than a lot of movies do.__An energetic, enjoyably preposterous compound - it's a paranoid thriller blended with pseudo-neuro-science fiction and catalyzed by a jolting dose of satire - directed by Neil Burger.__Better living through chemistry is a debatable notion satirically explored in this briskly paced, suspenseful thriller.__Without much fanfare Neil Burger has emerged as one of the best suspense directors in the business.
Cheerfully crappy schlock.__Made me laugh and held my interest more than it should have, given how sloppy it is. Call it an acceptable bit of B-minus work from a C student.__So what if it's sheer petty escapist enjoyment? Tower Heist delivers the laughs in desperate times.__Alan Alda plays the billionaire, and his oleaginous smarm is so good that you almost wish Alda were starring in a hard-edged movie about Madoff instead of this goofy heist picture that takes way too long getting to the heist.__This is, of course, Hollywood schlock, directed by shlock-master Brett Ratner. But it's also a surprisingly effective social drama.__Highly recommended if you want to watch an assortment of rich movie stars feel your pain.__The latest comedy-action film from director Brad Ratner is a shaggy affair, but it's intermittently inspired in its action sequences and the comic business of its sprawling cast.__Between the protracted setup and the fizzled execution, however, Tower Heist finds a nice comic groove in the job's planning stages, when Murphy finally bursts onto the scene and pings jokes off his timid counterparts.__You really want these poor schlubs to get their very justified revenge - just like you want to like this movie. It co-opts you from the very start.__Tower Heist feigns being an Ocean's 11 for schmucks, but plays like a retread of 48 Hours.__"Tower Heist" is an improbably satisfying action comedy, the kind of wax-on-wax-off, slickly machined Hollywood widget that meets its audience's expectations without once aspiring to exceed them.__It's a cunningly engineered movie that's as much fun as "Ocean's 11," a tale of a Renoir of ripoff who matches skills with freewheeling, improvisational rivals -- the Jackson Pollocks of plunder.__Another thing Ratner is good at is not wasting our time when he runs out of ideas. But he leaves us smiling, if not believing our own eyes.__The most that can be said for Tower Heist, the new action comedy from Brett Ratner, is that it's a middlingly well-done evocation of the big-budget caper you remember with vague fondness from long-ago matinees at the mall.__Eddie Murphy reignites his inner firecracker in Tower Heist, a middling comedy caper that can't match its star's focus.__"Tower Heist" might not be a classic (it's not), but at least for a little while it will make you laugh instead of cry about the current state of affairs, which is more than you can say about a lot of things.__The type of film with which Mr. Ratner has claimed to be infatuated is itself like a caper -- it requires precise execution. "Tower Heist" is more like that 10-story Snoopy, as he drunkenly bobs along Central Park West.__It's hard to go completely wrong when you've got Broderick shuffling around in a bathrobe and Murphy scampering in black leather.__You won't remember Tower Heist an hour later, but the top cast makes the jokes (even the lousy ones) go down easy.__Mr. Ratner goes for the safe bet and the easy score, which means that, for all his shows of solidarity with the working stiffs, he has more in common with the wealthy scam artist who took their hard-earned money.
There are so many variables moving so fast that it's a wonder Spielberg didn't have someone onboard from Princeton's department of Higher Math to help keep track. But his crack team here is enough.__It's delirious stuff, often laugh-out-loud funny.__The action grows wearisome as it grinds on, and the film becomes a succession of dazzling set pieces devoid of simple feelings.__A frenetic bonbon with an empty center, and a movie made without any perceivable audience outside of filmmakers besotted by their own innovative processes.__The Adventures of Tintin comes at you in a whoosh, like a volcano full of creative ideas in full eruption... It hits home for the kid in all of us who wants to bust out and run free.__Herge was the pioneer of an even-handed style of cartooning with solid lines and no shading that became known as ligne claire, but there is a decided lack of clear lines in this erratic movie adaptation of his work.__The main achievement of Tintin is that at least the cartoon people and pets come across as characters and not hollow, humanoid entities.__It adequately re-creates the comics' Dickensian characterization, and every frame brims with clever details. But once the action begins, Spielberg's incessant, force-fed "fun" quickly gets exhausting.__Motion capture, which transforms actors into cartoon characters in a vividly animated landscape, is the technique Spielberg has been waiting for - the Christmas gift ... that he's dreamed of since his movie childhood.__Even if this hyperactive movie isn't your cup of tea, there's much to admire on-screen, including Spielberg's astonishing attention to visual detail and John Williams' jaunty score.__A clamorous headache of a movie, it's hard to say who the intended audience for The Adventures of Tintin might be.__The Adventures of Tintin can be a delight to look at, even if motion capture isn't your particular cup of animation tea.__The joy [Spielberg] brings to the film's action is contagious.__If I wanted to spend two hours watching a plucky kid and his feisty dog run around having adventures, I'd dig out my old "Jonny Quest" cartoons.__The relentless pace is a big part of the fun. Who ever heard of a slow rollercoaster, anyway?__Herge's was an art of subtraction - of doing more with less - but that seems to have eluded Spielberg and Jackson.__It should win over the uninitiated, and work quite well for those who have already pitched their tents in the Tintin camp.__"The Adventures of Tintin" is an ambitious and lively caper, miles smarter than your average 3-D family film.__Although I personally still find the rubber-faced, pseudo-human figures produced by this technique unsettling, the work done by Spielberg and Jackson's animation teams here is exquisite.__I fear Spielberg and Jackson hitched their wagon to the wrong technological star here.
Adopting a clean, chronological and punchy approach, Soderbergh holds a steady eye on panic and chaos. It's a disaster movie with a brain and conscience.__The presence of movie stars helps: their authority is part of what keeps us fascinated by the gruesome fable, juicing it a bit, so that we can actually enjoy it.__Contagion is compelling.__Contagion is the best movie made to date about an epidemic/pandemic.__Along with the stars, Contagion has plenty of scares, though in contrast to Matt Damon and Kate Winslet, they're things you encounter every day.__The film resembles its viral subject a little too closely: an intricate, formidable mechanism with no evident purpose.__Steven Soderbergh's Contagion, written by Scott Burns, begins on a state of high alert and stays there for the rest of the movie.__[A] curiously inert new thriller from Steven Soderbergh.__Steven Soderbergh&#8203;'s viral "who brung it" is a mostly style-over-substance affair.__Contagion could have been a blood-curdling scream; instead it comes off as Soderbergh's star-powered science project.__It's the dark comic moments and the film's sci-fi, B-movie, race-to-develop-a-vaccine subplot that prevent Contagion from being a gloomy two hours in the dark. That and Soderbergh's delight in characters.__If Contagion is a "horror movie," as Soderbergh has described it, then you can think of it as the most believable zombie movie ever made.__Decent, but not completely viral.__If this is an action-thriller, it's one that makes med school look sexier than the Marines.__The rush of A-listers combined with apocalyptic dread creates its own kind of dizzy pleasure: Who's going down next on this Poseidon Adventure?__Contagion may be the most expensive public-service ad ever filmed, but it's also a surprisingly light-on-its-feet action thriller.__[An] intellectually stimulating new drama about the terrifyingly rapid spread of a lethal virus.__Takes great pains to present its situations realistically, and includes a lot of intelligent speculation about what sort of political, economic and ethical questions would be raised by such a disaster.__Sobering reality for our interconnected world.__Contagion is more unsettling than 1995's Outbreak or the disaster movies of the '70s.
Crowe, to his credit, is more concerned with insights about family than romance - and some of these are heart-on-sleeve touching if you've got a sweet tooth for the stickier stuff.__Nothing that happens in this movie is in the least surprising, but it's all quite pleasant and even, at times, moving.__The movie has animals, kids and fine acting from Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson, but it lacks the emotional honesty and unpredictability that made Crowe's early films so irresistible.__Damon and Colin Ford as his teen son have an affecting hesitancy, their hearts hovering between the living and the dead.__The picture annoys you, but it also wrings happy tears, because Crowe pulls at your heartstrings in crafty ways.__Crowe seems to be making baby steps into new territory, both stylistically and emotionally.__A professional actor in the best sense, always credibly grounded, Damon is much better than the material, and so is Colin Ford who plays the troubled son.__We Bought a Zoo is so filled with artificial sweetener that it may cause cancer.__Consider it a fine sign of emotional discipline that the movie doesn't overplay Kelly and Ben's romantic possibilites.__These are ideas from old movies, and presented without any of the conviction those pictures used to give them.__"We Bought a Zoo" provides a welcome seasonal dash of wholesomeness and humor, but it's also a heartening celebration of second acts, even at their most unwelcome.__Heartwarming holiday fare that even jaded adults can share with the kids.__The film is sweet. Its observations of life in the aftermath of death ring true, especially for anyone who's traveled the contours of mourning.__Not surprisingly, this menagerie of genres doesn't mesh.__"We Bought a Zoo" is as phony as a Kardashian marriage.__The creaks, groans and cliches of the screenplay ... are ... finally outstripped by the attractiveness of the performers, those with two legs and more, and especially by the tenderness that Mr. Damon brings to his role.__"We Bought a Zoo" is a movie you want to like, and a movie you can enjoy if you cut its slackness some slack.__The filmmakers insufficiently stir the lumpy metaphors, chief among them that for animals, as for humans, there is a difference between cages and enclosures.__While not quite Crowe at his absolute best, it carries his humanistic imprint and benefits from a strong acting ensemble that keep emotions in check.__There's a word for the strenuous, shameless plucking of an audience's emotions that this movie traffics in: cornography.
Moneyball is a winner, one of the freshest and smartest sports movies in years.__As an example of smarter-than-average Hollywood fare - and a sly dig at modern sporting politics - 'Moneyball' has all the key bases covered.__One of the most soulful of baseball movies -- it confronts the anguish of a very tough game.__The real protagonist of Moneyball, however, is Beane himself, played with great charisma by Brad Pitt.__[Pitt] provides ballast and a swaggering humor to a movie that, too often, strives to be The Social Network of baseball movies.__Pitt, who has a producing credit, is not the sole reason this tremendous -- yet intimate -- sports tale soars over the fences. The bench is deep. And the script has a powerful but finessed swing.__Moneyball turns an unlikely subject interesting, making a professional sport the nexus where past and future collide.__Moneyball is exactly like moneyball -- infused with intelligence, amusing in its attacks on false gods, but way easier to admire than to love.__A well-written, sharply acted film that's guaranteed to garner attention.__Naysayers have been claiming for years that the Moneyball book wouldn't work as a movie. But ultimately, it's the cinematic touches that keep this film version from becoming something exceptional.__Like a cold beer under a bluebird sky; like a flawless line drive on a warm summer's day; like a long, languorous seventh-inning stretch - "Moneyball" satisfies.__A crowd-pleasing baseball movie for people - like me - who don't like baseball movies.__Has to be described as an example of what Hollywood does best.__It's to the director's credit, and Pitt's, that Moneyball is anything but bloodless -- in its own quiet, unspectacular way, this movie courses with life.__Smart, minor-key entertainment.__Baseball fans know this story, but Miller puts it all in fascinating context. This is a thinking person's baseball movie, a more complex version of the inspirational sports story.__Starring Brad Pitt in top movie star form, it's a film that's impressive and surprising.__A deeply American film about a uniquely American sport in which a principled guy takes on the moneyed titans because he can't stand the unfairness of what they're doing to the game he still loves.__Pitt's Beane is as original a character as I've seen in a baseball drama.__It gives Mr. Pitt, who hurtles through the movie, a chance to scat like a juiced-up Ella Fitzgerald, working his phones and seemingly every other general manager in the country, as he transforms a new baseball philosophy into action.
__Totally mediocre...__What makes Jack And Jill worse than the average Sandler vehicle is Jill, who's been conceived as little more than a dude in drag, hold the jokes.__Sandler has become a good actor of late, but here he gives over most of his talents to Jill, who is so screechy, needy, and lovelorn that you can hardly blame Jack for wanting to fade into the background.__The apocalypse starts here.__It's all pretty unfunny, and leaves you too much time to wonder about other things. Like, how did this sludge ever get a PG rating?__It's cruel and creepy, not funny.__It's pretty sad if you're a comic and Al Pacino is the funniest thing in your movie.__Extruded from Sandler's Happy Madison filmic laugh factory, Jack and Jill makes lowbrow seem like grand opera, relying once again on fart, poop and sweat jokes to inject both yuks and yucks into the proceedings.__It is indeed every bit as lousy as it looks. So kudos to the marketing department, I guess. They nailed this one.__Lazy and slapdash, the work of a comedian trusting too much in his own hilariousness.__Feels like an elementary school recess that's gone on too long, the merrymaking strained and the participants looking tired even when they're in full comic dudgeon.__More than 24 hours has passed since I watched the new Adam Sandler movie Jack and Jill and I am still dead inside.__The pic's general stupidity, careless direction and reliance on a single-joke premise that was never really funny to begin with are only the most obvious of its problems.__If Pacino-on-Sandler action is your trailer's selling point, the movie better be brave enough to have Pacino bend him over. Heck, it's already doing the same to us.__I'm sorry to say that this may be Mr. Pacino's most convincing performance in years.__Al Pacino romantically pursuing a cross-dressing Adam Sandler around a medieval castle should be stunningly surreal, so it's a not-inconsiderable failure that Jack and Jill manages only dim, desperate outrageousness instead.__Comedy moved on from the mid-1990s, and it's time Sandler did, too. "Jack and Jill" even gives fart jokes a bad name.__A comedy that has one good joke, four strange cameos and a spirit so juvenile kids may wonder what Sandler's deal is.__There are moments in "Jack and Jill" that are genuinely funny - and, just like countless family reunions, there are moments when you can't wait for it to end.
Being a hardcore cinephile (like Scorsese) might add a layer of enjoyment, but it certainly isn't a prerequisite for walking in the door. A sense of wonder, however, is.__Scorsese transforms this innocent tale into an ardent love letter to the cinema and a moving plea for film preservation.__It might be curtains for celluloid, but Scorsese, a boyish 69, clearly isn't leaving the stage any time soon. He directs every film with the passion of his first. And it shows.__Thematic potency and cinematic virtuosity -- the production was designed by Dante Ferretti and photographed by Robert Richardson -- can't conceal a deadly inertness at the film's core.__For all the wizardry on display, Hugo often feels like a film about magic instead of a magical film...__I have seen the future of 3-D moviemaking, and it belongs to Martin Scorsese, unlikely as that may sound.__It's a fairy tale for mature viewers, but the airy exterior hides emotional depth.__One of the most magical viewing experiences of the decade so far.__Aside from being one of Scorsese's most personal films, it's also one of the least cynical films of this or any other year.__Hugo is a mixed bag but one well worth rummaging through.__Although it brings Scorsese together with people and techniques he hasn't worked with before, it also touches on themes close to his heart: the birth of cinema, and its preservation.__Scorsese's film is a richly illustrated lesson in cinema history and the best argument for 3-D since James Cameron's Avatar.__As befitting both its fetishistically detailed source material and the era in which it's set, Hugo is Scorsese's most visually accomplished film.__Hugo is pure movie magic.__If ever the movie gods were to smile on an adaptation, it would be Scorsese's take on Selznick's bestselling book, a valentine to the cinematic artists whose work the filmmaker has toiled so tirelessly to champion and preserve.__It's as if David Copperfield wandered into a History of Film lecture. Maybe it isn't a great idea to wait till you're nearly 70 to make your first kid movie.__A state-of-the-art affair, an epic adaptation of Selznick's pretty-epic-itself tome, full of dazzling visuals and rapturous tributes to Melies and the magic of movies.__Movie magic hangs in the air of Martin Scorsese's Hugo, much like the steam and dust that fills almost every frame.__Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' It's a sentiment that Scorsese seems to have taken to heart...__Bursting with earned emotion, Hugo is a mechanism that comes to life at the turn of a key in the shape of a heart.
____It has come to this: parents who have recorded their children's lives since infancy can see their home films edited into their child's very own 3-D concert documentary.__I find him such a bland, pious, profoundly unthreatening little Furby of a pop idol, but little girls' celebrity crushes are not to be trifled with. And this sensationally engineered promo film makes Justin Bieber look like a true force of nature.__The movie remains so sanitized, so authorized that it never gives us credit for being able to make up our own minds about him and what he represents.__Bieber's unquestionably gifted, and if he's smart enough to listen to the grounded, talented folk around him, there's every reason to hope that he'll turn out to be just fine when he grows up.__The movie is cunningly woven to show the tension between his insane success and his determination to remain a sane, normal 16-year-old.__Part biopic, part concert film and all crowd pleaser, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never is a big, glossy celebration of the musical phenom that knows exactly what it needs to do to send its target audience of 'tween girls into a tizzy of giddy screams.__An interminable documentary punctuated by perhaps half an hour of heavily edited 3-D performance footage.__Never Say Never is a 3D concert film to delight the shy 13-year-old with braces that lives in all of us, but after a while the movie starts to feel like lethal injection by bubblegum.__Equal parts biopic, concert film and pep rally, the movie's 105 minutes do a good job of conveying the pleasures of pop, courtesy of the very real talents of Justin Bieber.__What the movie lacks in genuine insight it makes up for in what fans really want: gazing shots at the Biebz whipping his hair back and forth.__"Never Say Never" is sort of like the featured piece of a political nominating convention. It's a fluffy, mildly inspiring, celebration of the hero leading up to his big moment.__Young fans will lose their minds, although that would have happened if the film consisted of an hour and 45 minutes of Bieber brushing his teeth. Adult chaperones who care nothing of the star's music will find the film surprisingly tolerable.__That Never doesn't work as a biopic isn't a surprise. Bieber's too young to paint a picture with much context.__What the 3-D film lacks in cinematic charm and ingenuity is compensated for by its subject's high-wattage charisma and low-key earnestness.__A sweetly entertaining, canny celebration of the pop heartthrob du jour.__[Bieber is] the perfect first crush, and this is the perfect movie for someone currently experiencing that crush.__Somebody on screen - you forget who all the adults are; they're not important - describes Bieber as "the Macaulay Culkin of music," which seems right, if a little sad.__The film's premise-that Bieber achieved his superstardom through years of hard work overcoming towering obstacles-is so ludicrously flawed that everything built upon it borders on self-parody.
As much as it grates, it still manages to warm the cockles.__Plenty of ambition. But the dialogue can be tin-eared, and the comedy has a cater- to-kids quality that sells youngsters short.__Instead of steering toward deep and troubled waters, "Dolphin Tale" jumps through hoops to engage a young audience.__That it manages to be not insufferable while still being so predictable is a small tribute to its cast and crew.__A potentially appealing story about a rescued disabled dolphin gets smothered with inspirational family values guff.__Most of the family films churned out today are so junky it's almost a shock to find one in which the animals never spout sassy one-liners, or show off their hilarious hip-hop moves.__Effective as the movie is, it nevertheless left me slightly put off.__A heartwarmingly hokey and accessible production.__Dolphin Tale is a reasonably well-made and likable story about the courageous efforts of a small, determined band of people who come to the rescue of a badly injured sea creature.__This is not only kid-friendly fare, but a lovely family movie.__Gamble's rapport with his finned costar is so touching that the movie works anyway.__It gives young audiences credit for having patience and imagination, and rewards them with an engaging narrative.__Accompanying grown-ups or older siblings will have to choke down a sizable dose of schmaltz with their fish milkshakes.__The cast is delightful, the story corny without being cloyingly high-fructose, the direction first-rate.__A lively, winning family movie starring the very sea mammal at the center of a true story that inspired this film.__It may not be a great movie, but it is an exceptionally touching one.__The result is an excellent family film - maybe not up to 1996's "Fly Away Home'' in the kid-helps-wildlife genre but eye-opening and heartwarming and sensibility-expanding all the same.__It's rudimentary and even a little clumsy in its filmmaking technique (not a small matter), but there's some narrative ambition, at least...__Kids are going to eat this up. Given what a dismal year it's been for the family film, it's likely their parents will, too.__Freeman is clearly enjoying himself, but his mega-watt presence and some unnecessary 3D are just about the only things separating Dolphin Tale from an Animal Planet original movie.
Portman can look smug in light-touch comedy, but her chemistry with Kutcher is believable (though to be fair, Kutcher is the golden retriever of male leads: blandly irresistable).__At least Portman is playing someone who is recognizably human, unlike her dancer in Black Swan.__The charismatic leads keep this watchable, but it's a waste of their talents.__No Strings Attached is so palpably calculated that you know if the camera had pulled back a foot from the bed in which Portman and Kutcher were pretending to have sex, you'd have seen their agents standing by beaming: proud parents, proud pimps.__One of the better romantic comedies in the last couple of years.__The shaggy fringes of the flick get most of the laughs -- for one, it's absurdly obsessed with '90s hip-hop__A lot of sharp lines from screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether and a strong supporting cast are often enough to make that premise pleasant if not exactly shocking.__It's not that the leads aren't affable. They are. It's not that they aren't nice to look at. They are. (Although the cinematography makes them look sort of blotchy.) It's just hard to care if they hook up after they, well, hook up.__The picture is no great shakes as cinema, and a shade too cute for its own good. Still, it's a mild shock to see a competent film released in the January trough.__No matter how sweet and good-looking and likeable they may be, the bottom line remains: You know what's going to happen from the very beginning.__"No Strings Attached" is the first fun date movie of the year. The first fun movie, actually.__The movie quickly sinks into a terminal case of the cutes and extreme predictability - amid the usual surfeit of wacky supporting characters.__There are humorous moments, and it's a bit less bland than its contemporaries.__Sadly, an obsession with raunchy one-liners trips everything up, turning a clever conceit into something closer to a sleazy, cheesy affair.__It takes a gimmicky premise, about two people who try to have a purely sexual relationship, and then fulfills it without distorting or bending the characters around a formula.__You can see where No Strings Attached is heading before it gets there, but it's still a pleasant enough and surprisingly romantic ride.__After the heavy dramatic lifting of Black Swan, you can't fault Oscar favorite Natalie Portman for signing up for some romcom R&R. It's too bad she couldn't have landed a less generic vehicle than No Strings Attached.__What elevates No Strings Attached above the average (usually awful) romantic comedy is a decent script, the sure hand of veteran director Ivan Reitman and the likeable performances of stars Portman and Kutcher.__It's a smart, sexy romcom that turns the neat trick of staying sweetly human.__Portman will get past this speed bump with well-earned swiftness. The affable Kutcher, however, seems stuck in a cycle of depressingly empty comedies.
Holy mother of pearl, talk about superficial claptrap!__The director, Mark Waters, moves things briskly along and lets the charming absurdity of penguin behavior rise to its inherently good-natured heights.__The good news is that, even though one must pace oneself through the dull parts, usually involving Mr. Popper's dullish family, [Carrey's] in pretty good form whenever he's getting physical__Such a brazenly moronic and uninspired example of a family movie that you'd swear it was a parody of brazenly moronic and uninspired family movies.__Why is Jim Carrey standing around watching penguins be funny? Why isn't he in a movie where Jim Carrey is funny?__Jim Carrey's farts-and-flippers comedy, which, though exceedingly dumb, is at least very smart about what appeals to 4- to 10-year-old kids, fans of Happy Feet, March of the Penguins, and YouTube animal videos.__It's an old-fashioned movie, gentling its way toward satisfying familial reunion, fueled by almost always endearing penguin antics.__[Carrey's] always "on," even when the character is supposed to be off; by the end of the movie, there isn't a piece of scenery that doesn't bear his teethmarks.__Carrey looks frozen out of his own movie -- a stiffer and less elastic version of the younger dynamo. He could have used some of that CGI magic himself.__Fortunately, the movie throws adults a few bones along the way; this is by no means an unpleasant film to watch, and the Ice Age short that runs with it is funny, too.__Carrey, who is something of a CGI peacock himself, is the best thing about the film, which should delight young audiences even as it diverts their adult handlers.__Thanks to plucky performances and some perfectly precious pets, "Mr. Poppers Penguins" provides a pleasant, if obviously packaged, pursuit.__A surprisingly touching, low-key ballad of middle-aged male regret disguised as a kiddie comedy replete with poop and fart jokes and soccer balls launched at Popper's crotch.__Mr. Popper's Penguins bears almost no resemblance to the classic children's book of the same name. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.__"Mr. Popper's Penguins," a mildly amusing flight of fancy for the family crowd, is far better for its penguins than its Popper.__Be prepared for the oh-so-real possibility that your kid -- or your wife -- is going to want a penguin for Christmas after seeing this movie.__Everything about the idea of "Mr. Popper's Penguins" sounds lovely, and everything about the actual movie is ugly.__My heart was warmed by gratuitous moments when Mr. Carrey clowns for clowning's sake -- in the best of them, he makes a slo-mo entrance to a press conference, even though the camera is running at normal speed.__Everything about it is synthetic except for the occasions in which Carrey can rouse himself from the somnolence of family-movie slop.__A mildly amusing specimen of a genre that has produced some of the most unspeakable atrocities of recent cinema.
If there's a saving grace, it's the visuals, especially the beautiful scenes of orange krill. But that's about all.__For all the noise and flapping, the movie, like its heroes, remains flightless.__Happy Feet was one of the greatest and most original animated films, but the sequel can't even decide what it's about for the first 40 minutes.__We get a feeling we've seen it all before.__The gotta-move protagonist of the first animated, Antarctica-set feature -- a misfit young Emperor penguin named Mumble -- returns for the sequel. Only this time he's all grown up... and a lot less fun.__The film reminds viewers young and old that to make a positive change, sometimes the little guy at the bottom of the food chain needs to stomp his feet.__Other than commercially, more is less in this antic, not so funny sequel to the 2006 blockbuster.__The disjointed, undercooked sequel to the Oscar-winning 2006 hit aims to tell life lessons and celebrate pop music, but this would-be toe-tapper is curiously out of step.__Much like its Oscar-winning predecessor, the story focuses on lads and dads, though there are strong mama figures and daughters, too.__Follows in the original's footsteps on a more reasonable scale while sparing audiences an emotional ambush.__It's hard to resist dancing penguins, but "Happy Feet Two" may make you want to try.__The movie's bereftness of invention can be measured by how no story element builds on another. Instead, "Happy Feet Two" is plotted so that a bunch of disparate things happen, until it's time to end the movie.__97 minutes of nonstop joy.__It's hard to resist a children's movie where two comic krill named Will and Bill toss off a reference to existential angst one minute and make really bad wordplays, as in "Goodbye, krill world" and "one in a krillion," the next.__For a computer-animated movie about dancing penguins, it's surprisingly leaden. Not even the impressive voice talent can rev up this clumsy spectacle.__Like father, like son; like Disney, like everyone else. And like first movie, like sequel.__If it weren't for the comic relief provided by Will and Bill, tiny shrimplike crustaceans known as krill and voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, this would be a forbidding return to Antarctica indeed.__It's familiar enough not to spook fans of the (highly profitable) first, but Happy Feet Two branches out beyond prefab coming-of-age stories and gimmicky pop-song set pieces.__Centuries from now, cultural historians will look at "Happy Feet Two'' and ask one question: What the heck were they smoking?__The animation remains impressive, and there are some very funny moments, courtesy of the talented cast. But fans of the original will want to lower their expectations.
May eventually surrender to convention and implausibility in equal measure, but until then, Collet-Serra grounds the conspiracy with a proper sense of mystery and mood.__The movie rather crumbles when it eventually has to deliver its secrets.__For about an hour or so, "Unknown" is intriguing.__Neeson's comforting intelligence (and a marvelous turn by Bruno Ganz as an ailing former member of the East German secret police), are not enough to prevent the film from choking on obviousness and directorial fumbling.__Unknown" obviously knows its limitations, and it doesn't bother to rise above them. It just keeps throwing the punches the audience wants and expects. It won't cure world hunger, but chances are it will sell a lot of popcorn.__The cat-and-mouse game that the filmmakers are playing with us is only partially successful because this thriller is only intermittently thrilling. Instead of being captivated by the twist and turns, we're more likely to be rankled.__The snow and haze that Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra keeps pumping into the street scenes seem to have drifted into the script as well.__It's not "North by Northwest," of course. But at least it's heading in the right direction.__Has no connection to anything resembling reality, but it's entertaining as hell.__The art of the classic Hitchcockian thriller is about style, pace and misdirection -- and though Unknown is occasionally baffling and involves running and car chases, the film rarely manages to thrill.__Despite its A-movie aspirations, as the chases continue and the plot holes widen, Unknown quickly settles into the familiar B-movie comfort zone.__As long as filmgoers come to "Unknown" unencumbered by a need for plausibility, this handsome, well-paced production possesses its share of twisty, visceral pleasures.__Plot holes you can drive a truck through are ultimately less important for your enjoyment than how they set up the film's big set pieces.__A stylish and muscular thriller with some nifty twists and turns, a wicked sense of humor, several terrific performances and not one or even two but three of the best car chases in recent action-flick history.__On a minute-to-minute level, it's an engaging mystery, the kind that rewards our participation with eye candy and adrenaline shots.__Neeson is always magnetic, though, even when he's just repeating his Taken performance and delivering cheesy one-liners, as he is eventually required to do here.__When the dots are connected (sort of), Unknown still doesn't make much sense.__Neeson has a way of getting upset - a frantic purposefulness - that fills viewers with both empathy and anticipation: He's so miserable that we care.__But if you dig Liam Neeson as an action hero, you could do worse than this fast-paced, cheerfully ridiculous, generally satisfying romp.__The material keeps our attention but, as we get closer to the inevitable point at which the curtain is pulled back, the movie starts to feel more like a parody than a serious endeavor.
Accomplished filmmaking that features two highly attractive, talented leads, a healthy dose of sentiment, an intelligent script, and which takes you away for two hours from the quotidian worries and banalities of your regular life.__This mind-meld of sci-fi thriller, morality play and passionate romance is worth seeing, mostly for the palpable chemistry between the lead actors.__Damon and Blunt give such terrific performances you might almost forgive the movie's dopey ending.__The on-screen pairing of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is so winning that you may be willing to overlook the oddly modulating tone of the story that brings them together and then tries to keep them apart.__Fans looking for something a little different will find it here - as well as the first real romance of the year.__Cradled in Damon's solidly reliable hands, even a movie as extravagantly silly as this one gains heft and credibility, an impressive accomplishment when you consider that the entire plot revolves around magic notebooks and spellbinding hats.__Sometimes, a strong premise makes for a weak movie, which ends up drowning in its own clever conceit.__It's hard to imagine a more spectacularly silly film making it to theaters this year than The Adjustment Bureau.__The Adjustment Bureau presents itself as a paean to free will, to overcoming obstacles, to creating your own destiny-provided, that is, that you happen to be a dude.__Because the chemistry between Damon and Blunt is so strong, what might have been a jumble of Matrix-style oddments comes across instead as ardent.__The Adjustment Bureau has you pondering the angles throughout, and it's a credit to newly minted director George Nolfi that he never lets his foot off the gas pedal.__The misleading trailers for the supremely goofy "The Adjustment Bureau" promise action-packed sci-fi. What you actually get is a love-struck Matt Damon running for the US Senate as he's stalked by fedora-wearing angels.__A smart, stylish thriller that melds science fiction, romance and Hitchcock-ian intrigue with surprising ease.__"The Adjustment Bureau" is a smart and good movie that could have been a great one if it had a little more daring.__Suspenseful, romantic and wryly funny, "The Adjustment Bureau" is the kind of film that reaffirms one's faith in Hollywood.__Easily one of the best American love stories of the past year.__You can feel the influence of classic American movies like "North by Northwest" and "The Graduate" here, and while I won't argue that Nolfi matches those examples, his ambition is admirable.__Whether running or kissing or running and kissing (well, almost), Mr. Damon and Ms. Blunt turn romance into a palpable race.__A thoughtful and thought-provoking romance with a touch of the fantastic.__The premise is so mind-boggling and fraught with implications that it tends to obviate the action mechanics of the last couple reels.
Supporting characters are too hastily sketched in, serving only to further the unsmooth course of true love.__Water for Elephants may not be the best show on earth, but it's still quite a show.__'Water for Elephants' has charm, and this more grown up role suits Pattinson more than the histrionics of last year's 'Remember Me'.__The movie rather embarrassingly sells chastity in the midst of what feels like a lawless situation. It's handsomely mounted but timid.__The great intangible of chemistry isn't present, making Water for Elephants seem longer and slower than one might hope.__Isn't it OK, once in a while, just to enjoy the spectacle of two beautiful people kissing in a train car in the shadow of an elephant?__Witherspoon makes an incongruously squeaky Marlena, and it doesn't help that Pattinson is about as ardently expressive as a log of wood trying to pass itself off as James Dean.__Does the sheer Hollywood hoopla add up to a perversely enjoyable brand of something that can be loosely called entertainment? I think it does.__Witherspoon sparkles appropriately, Waltz is indeed one scary dude and Pattinson acquits himself well enough, although he leans too much on grinning as a default reaction.__Water For Elephants is not, to borrow the Benzini Bros. Circus' motto -- "the most spectacular show on Earth." But it is a class act.__The film has a pleasing retro-ness that often mitigates the dullness.__From scene to scene, and plot point to plot point, nothing connects. Pattinson, Witherspoon, and Waltz perform in separate rings of their three-ring circus.__"Pattinson's beauty crowds out just about everything else."__"Water for Elephants" is one ring short of a three-ring hit.__How do I count the ways this movie goes wrong?__You know where the thing is headed. Still, it's fun to watch.__Usually, you have to wait for the end-of-the-year awards season to see an elaborate period piece that fails as spectacularly as "Water for Elephants."__As usual, Pattinson's acting consists of shaking his head and whimpering.__Director Francis Lawrence and writer Richard LaGravenese replicate just enough of the novel's fantasy to keep audiences involved, even if the results hardly add up to the most spectacular show at the cineplex.__The script by Richard LaGravenese, who is well-versed in adapting popular fiction such as Bridges of Madison County, lacks the sparkle of his best work.
It's really just a solid courtroom drama, but these days moviegoers should take what they can get.__It has nothing to do with the capital of Nebraska or the former president. While you're watching it, though, you'll wish it did.__There's a reason potboiler paperbacks don't make good movies -- there's too much outlandish plot, even for Hollywood.__Just when you thought Matthew McConaughey had settled into pre-retirement content to play the (dry-aged) beefcake in a string of dippy romantic comedies, the actor comes roaring back with some real acting.__That the premise of the film doesn't make a ton of sense shouldn't dissuade you if you're in the mood for a little escape.__The Lincoln Lawyer is not a feat of genre-breaking design. But it is a well-oiled machine.__The ride can be a bit bumpy, but The Lincoln Lawyer gets you where you're going.__It would be more fun if the hero were a little more colorful. All Matthew McConaughey's Haller has to his character is his cockiness, and that gets a bit tiresome.__This is rock-solid entertainment. McConaughey, a cunning mesmerizer in the courtroom, steers this Lincoln into what could be a hell-raising franchise.__"The Lincoln Lawyer" just may have the makings of a terrific franchise, if only because it finds McConaughey so clearly in his comfort zone after a string of forgettable romantic comedies and action pictures.__Calling big-screen legal thriller "The Lincoln Lawyer" the best TV pilot I've seen in a while really isn't meant as a putdown -- the truth is, there's more good stuff on the tube these days than in theaters, especially at this time of the year.__Fellow jurors, let's remember The Lincoln Lawyer at its best and deliver a generous verdict -- an innocent entertainment, with extenuating circumstances.__One of the year's most delightful Hollywood surprises.__The spotlight is firmly on McConaughey, but he earns all the attention.__It marches at an efficient pace, but there's too much collateral damage to believability.__"The Lincoln Lawyer" is workmanlike, engagingly acted and entertaining.__What happened - did Matthew McConaughey roll out of bed one morning and decide that, after smiling through one too many schlocky movies, playing the pretty boy opposite Sandra-Kate-Jennifer, he wanted to do something decent?__While Furman shows a mostly steady hand with his actors, the narrative flow trips things up considerably. Connelly's book turns out to be too much for screenwriter John Romano to handle.__This screen adaptation of Michael Connelly's clever legal thriller is stylish, suspenseful and thoroughly entertaining.__This pungent neo-noir can be sleazy and over-familiar, but like the protagonist, it's so smart and crafty that you may forgive its flaws.
It's fun and it's most welcome.__"Midnight in Paris" is a bonbon to ease the craving for Allen's earlier, funnier films.__Midnight in Paris is a loving embrace of the city, of art and of life itself.__Our hero has found his groove among the Lost Generation and, for us, there's some amusement to be had in sharing Gil's thrills -- it's like stepping into a Classic Comics version of A Moveable Feast.__Midnight in Paris is charming and clever, at times wickedly astute and hopeful.__There is breezy comedy to be made of a YouTube-age writer meeting the icons and idols of a bygone, classical era, but Allen goes deeper, expanding on his time-travel device to make unexpected and unexpectedly generous observations.__Woody Allen attracts promising players and does nothing with them.__I find this upfront fantasy to be his funniest, most agreeable comedy in years.__Woody Allen's beleaguered heroes have never been reluctant to indulge in a little fantasy to get what they want.__It makes us happily remember the movies we thought Allen wasn't able to make anymore, even while the filmmaker reaches into the past to add one more great one to the list.__It succeeds because Allen's muse is completely activated, unlike last year's time-waster You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, in which thought ran no deeper than the title joke.__What's Wilson doing in a Woody Allen movie about a B-list screenwriter who time-travels from the present to the Jazz Age? Disarming the audience with his wistful joie de vivre, that's what.__Midnight in Paris is a terrific picture -- an appealing, bubbly, intelligent fantasy made by a director in an unusually playful mood.__"Midnight in Paris" finds Allen in a larky, slightly tart and altogether bountiful mood, giving filmgoers a movie that, while unabashedly funny and playful, provides a profiterole or two for thought.__A movie that's loving and wistful and often hysterically funny.__While Allen may not be reinventing any wheels, he still has it.__A sweet-natured trifle, as flavorful and as thin as a crepe.__A delicious trifle for anyone who has ever dreamt of bantering about the cinema with Luis Bunuel or lounging at the piano to hear Cole Porter sing "Let's Do It."__"Midnight in Paris" makes you yearn for the time when brainy larks weren't a once-a-year occasion.__Woody Allen must have had a great time writing this screenplay.
Anyone who has ever seen a romantic comedy before knows where this one is going.__The chemistry between Kunis and her co-star Justin Timberlake is electric.__It's one of those rare made-in-Hollywood couplings that transcends the ordinary stuff of movies, like plot and sense and credibility.__Fast-paced and fabulously fake, Friends With Benefits is the Red Bull of romantic comedies, unapologetically delivering a hyperactive, synthetic buzz.__Kunis and Timberlake achieve the trickier feat of looking just as happy hanging out as they do sucking face, and when the cliches inevitably come rolling in, they feel earned rather than like a cop-out.__Friends with Benefits is fast, allusive, urban, glamorous -- clearly the Zeitgeist winner of the summer.__"Friends With Benefits" is often uproariously and profanely funny, and anchored in high-spirited performances from its central duo, who are well matched as comic foils if oddly lacking in erotic electricity.__The best romantic comedy of the year.__Friends With Benefits is a dumb, by-the-numbers romantic comedy. Yet I kept finding small things to enjoy in it, mainly because of the two hard-to-hate leads.__It succeeds, thanks to comedic chemistry between the two leads and nimble direction by Will Gluck.__Directed with quick-witted ease by Will Gluck, the [film is a] frank, frisky, even touching romantic comedy.__A witty rom-com for the smart-phone generation.__The jokes don't all work and the topical references can be irritably hipper-than-thou, but at least director and cowriter Will Gluck aims high: this is patterned on the Tracy and Hepburn comedies, albeit with a lot more skin.__Timberlake and Kunis try hard to keep this charm machine purring, and they do indeed have traces of chemistry... But their chemistry is at the service of a science project we've all seen before.__It is elevated by energetic dialogue, the sexual chemistry between the leads and the fact that the miscommunication that keeps bliss at bay - there's always one in a rom-com, and usually it is annoyingly unbelievable - is plausible.__It's gross and kind of embarrassing. For everyone.__"Friends With Benefits" isn't nearly as original as it pretends to be. But it's cute and funny and sweet, which -- as any woman can attest -- puts it way ahead of most Friday night options.__A savvy, satirical date movie that holds the conventions of romantic comedy up to self-aware spoofing while still delivering the goods.__If "Friends With Benefits" ultimately succumbs to the very sins it so cleverly deconstructs, it still commits those infractions with a welcome degree of wit and, when it slows down enough, spirited flair.__Will Gluck's bright screwball farce has witty dialogue that sparkles, at least by debased 21st-century standards.
The young "Four" cast appears to have been plucked from an Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue - which isn't an issue until you realize that the characters they're playing are about as thin as the pages in that Gen-Y fashion Bible.__The door is left wide open for a sequel, but it's hard to imagine there'll be much call for it.__The sci-fi-teen romance I Am Number Four is witless, insultingly derivative, muddy-looking, and edited in the hammering epileptic style that marks so many films produced, as this one is, by Michael Bay.__Granted, I Am NumberFour is a little better and makes loads more sense than Eagle Eye, Caruso's most recent vehicle for comely young actors in peril. But neither one has the sass and pluck of Disturbia. Watch that instead.__Pettyfer - a child actor turned model turned self-satisfied hunk - isn't much except blond hair and good cheekbones as our hero.__Perhaps February's recent history as a movie "dumping ground" has me feeling overly generous, but "I Am Number Four" was an enjoyable romp.__I Am Number Four's CGI sequences are murky and dark, its performances negligible, its script genuinely inept. There is, I should note, a puppy, which arguably keeps the film this side of completely unbearable, but just barely.__Say this for I Am Number Four: It's blessedly free of any original sins. Instead, they're all copied.__Strip away the uninspired mythology, and I Am Number Four is just your average high school movie with below-average drama.__For all of its homicidal aliens and toothy beasts, "I Am Number Four" did contain one element that genuinely unsettled me: the line "produced by Michael Bay." Nooooooo!__A Superman-come-lately tale of puppy love, extraordinary powers and puberty that's duller than a chalkboard and less powerful than an extraneous Jonas brother.__"I Am Number Four" delivers none of the spectacle of a competent sci-fi film, none of the emotion of an effective teen romance and none of the giggles of a kitsch fiasco.__A cookie-cutter action film that hopes to stand on the shoulders of Twilight and Spider-Man but plays like Spider-lite.__The movie version of I Am Number Four is a blatant, cynical pitch for an unearned franchise, made by people who seem to think the words "bestseller" and "young adult" are enough to guarantee a Harry Potter-like box office payout. It's not.__"I Am Number Four," the appealing new kid-on-the-teen-angst block, reverberates with much of the same dark combustible mix of action and romance that's been fueling the "Twilight" vampire mega-franchise for a while now.__Caruso aims for flashy fun and hits the target.__Tapping into the same vein of teen melodrama that runs through the Twilight franchise, I Am Number Four hurls a moody adolescent from outer space into the halls of a smalltown American high school.__Mostly "I Am Number Four'' is a pokey, pretty, predictable romance in which the boy is a shy extraterrestrial with secret powers and a royal lineage - your classic study-hall daydream - and the girl is a gentle alt-goddess.__A polished but unremarkable science-fiction adventure, I Am Number Four is the kind of movie you enjoy while it's in front of you but soon forget about.__Really, everything in I Am Number Four is recognizable from many past films.
Ultimately, Source Code makes good on its Hitchcockian opening sequence -- it may pale in comparison to the master, but it's a fun, puzzle-filled ride, with excellent pacing and a mounting uneasiness that recalls the best episodes of The Twilight Zone.__Source Code is a sci-fi thriller that simply shouldn't work as well as it does.__It's this emotional arc underlying the ticking-time-bomb plot that keeps the movie from succumbing to its flaws.__A thoroughly original, imaginative and fast-flying tale in which the Groundhog Day aspects are secondary to a story of service, honor and dedication.__Holes in logic get swept aside by the brisk pace and stimulating tale.__A casually brainy and surprisingly thoughtful blockbuster... that is ultimately as much about saving the day as seizing it.__The movie is a formally disciplined piece of work, a triumph of movie syntax, made with a sense of rhythm and pace, and Gyllenhaal, who is always good at conveying anxiety, gives Stevens's desperation a comic edge.__This time, Jones has more money and greater studio expectations behind him, so what begins as another existential head trip that puts ideas before spectacle eventually morphs into something trite and compromised -- hard sci-fi gone soft.__A smart sci-fi thriller that maybe asks a bit more of its audience than the average movie. But the payoff is solid, and really -- how long is eight minutes?__Duncan Jones' swiftly paced and engaging sci-fi thriller is a Groundhog Day for a post- 9/11 world.__Years -- months? -- hence I expect there will be an avalanche of PhD theses focusing on these mumbo-jumbo mind-meld melodramas. In the meantime you can pick up your BA at the multiplex today.__None of this makes any sense if you think about it, but the idea is so much fun that thinking about it may be your last impulse.__It's Jones' restrained direction that keeps Source Code moving, and confirms him as the rare filmmaker able, or maybe just choosing, to understand that even movies with explosions don't have to be dumb to entertain.__The problem with "Source Code" is the idea of "Source Code."__Director Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley also deserve credit for expertly shuffling the plot.__The first film in a while to have a decent heart while quickening your pulse.__Putting across a premise as fantastical as this film's requires top-flight acting, as well as a kind of poker face, and that's precisely what the movie delivers.__A fun ride of a sci-fi thriller with terrific romantic chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan.__For the most part, "Source Code" delivers on its promises with precision and care - all that's missing is Punxsutawney Phil and a toast to world peace.__A thriller that takes a science fiction premise and uses it, not for the sake of splashy effects, but as a doorway into the human soul.
New Year's Eve is a perfect example of why the adjective "Hollywood" is so often used as a pejorative.__The only entertaining way to watch New Year's Eve is as a cruel experiment in which performers stranded with absolutely no script support are forced to subsist on pure presence, which quickly becomes a blood sport in which only a few survive.__Written on the level of a bad episode of The Love Boat, this is one of those concoctions that intertwines about 10 storylines and then concludes with a cherry on top.__The only thing that can inspire more cynicism than a holiday's coerced emotions may be a film that both exploits and celebrates said emotions.__It's all perfectly pleasant and perfectly harmless and perfectly bland.__Should auld acquaintance be forgot? I don't know, but "New Year's Eve" sure should be.__This New Year's Eve leaves you feeling like you've got no one to kiss at midnight.__None of the marquee names come off particularly well here, so it's more a matter of figuring out who embarrasses themselves the most.__Sags when it should shimmer, labors clunkily when it should glide and - most unforgivably - plops some otherwise attractive and even talented actors into roles that are completely outside their physical and psychic comfort zone.__A soul-sucking monument to Hollywood greed and saccharine holiday culture.__We hope that somewhere amid the streamers and popping champagne corks director Marshall is making a resolution to stop making these movies.__An even lazier, even dumber re-hash of Valentine's Day - a movie that was already very lazy and dumb to begin with.__What can be said about a movie that is nice and awful? That has a warm spirit and is 100 percent phony? That has all the stars in the galaxy and all the appeal of rotting fish?__The screenplay isn't written so much as assembled in carefully slotted little blocks, following the rules of a screenwriting textbook.__The film is like one of those Robert Altman big-canvas movies minus the inspiration.__Why bother with a new title? New Year's Eve is simply 2010's Valentine's Day all over again, and it's about as appealing as a flute of cheap Champagne left over from the last holiday.__The movie plays like a time warp to 1951. The opening shot of the movie is a horse and buggy. Jon Bon Jovi plays pop music's hottest superstar. You half expect the actors to pass a kissing booth or an organ grinder with a leashed monkey.__This is more of a clown car than it is a movie.__"New Year's Eve'' is fun in the way that eating at a buffet is fun. It's two hours of foods that have nothing to do with each other piled high on a plate because it was too cheap to resist.__Director Garry Marshall follows last year's Valentine's Day with New Year's Eve where an all-star cast lines up to collect paychecks - at our expense!
Not so much insidious as inexcusable.__Wan and Whannell have, in effect, ripped pages from the "Poltergeist" playbook and stripped the formulas down to old-style gothic scares.__If there's a complaint to be made about Insidious, it's that the film's second half is unable to live up to the impossibly high standards set by the first half.__Insidious isn't scary. It's laughable. And kind of sad.__There's little new here. And what is new isn't well done.__Nothing slows down a movie down like people sitting around a living room discussing the meaning of "astral projection."__"Insidious" establishes that these folks can make a film that operates on an entirely different level, sans gore, or obvious gimmicks. And make flesh crawl.__The strongest analogue for the second half of "Insidious" is one that the filmmakers probably weren't trying for: it feels like a less poetic version of an M. Night Shyamalan fairy tale.__It's too much "Saw" and not enough "Paranormal."__From the opening credits, in which the title appears in blood-red letters to the accompaniment of blaring, dissonant music, the movie tries to get under your skin and inside your mind. Sometimes it does.__There's not much that's insidious, or subtle, here. A prolonged scene involving an unnerving high-pitched burglar alarm does get under our skin. But it's far more annoying than frightening.__The film is weighed down by too many forehead-palming lapses and an overall sense of "been there."__Here's a better-than-average spook house movie, mostly because Insidious decides it can haunt an audience without spraying it with blood.__The final shocker succeeds in shocking, and does so sans gore. But first we have to wade through a red door and a red hallway, pleas to "follow my voice,'' and an infinity of fog about as scary as dry ice vapor spilling onto a dance floor.__All calculation aside, scary is still scary, and Insidious makes up in old-fashioned tension what it sometimes lacks in originality.__Not terrifically good, but moviegoers will get what they're expecting.__If your idea of a fun night out is to be manipulated by freaky sound effects, jumpy edits, and point-of-view shots of ceiling fans whooshing menacingly, Insidious is the film for you.__builds legitimate haunted-house dread ... [but] at a very specific point ... possession turns jokey and hokey.__Aesthetically, Insidious operates at the level of a decent high school video project.__The film is stylish and quietly unsettling even in its derivativeness, and it delivers the sort of slow-building chills that ruffle the hair at the back of your neck, at least until the frights get a little too literal, in the movie's third act.
An unnecessary, though enjoyable, remake of Kevin Bacon's 1984 breakout hit.__It seems more pandering (and dated) than ever.__"Footloose" has the look and feel of an OK basic cable movie."__In terms of empty-headed exuberance, it's hard to top Footloose.__May not make as great a dent in the current generation as the original film had, but it does offer up a commendable amount of energy and heart...__Paramount's Footloose reboot never quite cuts loose enough to distinguish itself from the original.__By the time four little girls teach a dorky guy to dance to (the original) "Let's Hear It for the Boy" I was a gelatinous blob of pure affection. Bring on "Flashdance" 2.0.__Brewer has delivered a largely unobjectionable note-for-note facsimile of Herbert Ross's ode to teenage rebellion, young love and the unfettered joy of movement.__This new version will quite capably supply the same amount of carefree fun to a new generation. Which is exactly what a clever, if not particularly ambitious, remake sets out to do.__Footloose drags its heels to the senior prom and, when it finally gets there, shoves in one last punch-up that puts an odd spin on what should be an upbeat display of happy feet.__Give credit to Craig Brewer, the filmmaker behind the new Footloose, for realizing a new step was in order.__A new Footloose with sassier steps and the same contrived story is hardly necessary.__Stays remarkably close to its predecessor in all the ways that count.__It's a vibrant youth musical that will appeal to audiences who haven't seen the 1984 original. And it has enough charm and life to it to compete with the memory of the earlier version.__Footloose 2011 is harmless as far as it goes, but on the dance floor and off it never goes nearly far enough.__Maybe there is something timeless in anachronism. Maybe Brewer has located the heart beneath the hoke.__It's an eruption of joyous, jitterbugging energy and a polished piece of filmmaking.__Every now and then, we need to be reminded that shaking your booty is something essential. Or, in the case of director Craig Brewer's Footloose update, shaking your rebooty.__Wormald lacks Bacon's charisma but Hough has an undeniable star quality, and Teller is a comic delight.__Clearly, Brewer has come to praise Footloose, not to bury it, and so he leaves Dean Pitchford's screenplay more or less intact. The result is one of the more pleasant surprises of 2011.
__As cumbersome and drawn out as a slowly deflating tire, this cinematic collision between Vaughn's celebrated funny-surly persona and Howard's earnest pedigree is a bore -- and a serious miscalculation.__Who ever thought that Ron Howard could make a cult film? This movie is a mess, but it's an intelligent and affecting mess.__It lacks faith in its story, characters and audience.__Perhaps the late Blake Edwards could have found a balance between slapstick and psychodrama, but Ron Howard can't get the pacing right, and Allan Loeb's script is even wordier than the one he wrote for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.__Ends with 20 minutes of apologies, a round robin of regret that downshifts the film's sputtering energy into park.__The filmmakers just don't know what to do about the ladies.__Bromances being what they are, Vince's sharp pang of disappointment might have been worth pursuing but, Ron Howard being who he is, not a chance.__Let's have a toast for Vince Vaughn, shall we?__Can we ever truly know someone? Can we even answer the question? Probably not, but The Dilemma gets credit for trying.__Torn between establishing itself as a bromantic comedy or a relationship potboiler, the movie meets the requirements of neither. It is unsatisfying in general.__The script by Allan Loeb careens all over the place without ever coming to rest on anything interesting.__A very poor effort from a talented group of people, this is a terrible movie wrapped in a glossy package.__The January movie burial ground claims another victim. RIP.__There's no "Dilemma" here at all - just a simple disappointment.__There is much to say about the love that, except in comedies, dare not speak its name - the kind between straight men. "The Dilemma" says enough of it to be interesting.__While Vaughn proves he's still got the fast-talking bravado that makes him so bewilderingly watchable, neither his quick wit nor his chemistry with Kevin James can transform "The Dilemma" into the gold standard of buddy comedies.__The Dilemma never stops being a movie, and never starts being a good one.__Dilemma rests on the same structural foundation as episodes of Three's Company, when Mr. Roper thought he heard shenanigans through the kitchen door. A simple conversation would clear things up.__What "The Dilemma" ultimately does best is create a platform for Vaughn to drag that iconic character of his into full-blown adulthood.
It's as bright and twinkling as a Christmas tree, decked with warmth and humor.__It's busy but buoyant, and it honors the tradition of giving with wit and style.__The action is swift and witty, and the 3-D effects are imaginative and not simply tacked on as with so many animated movies these days.__The movie fails utterly at coming up with a story that merits all the eye candy.__With a clever script that successfully updates many Christmas myths and dialogue that crackles with sophisticated wit, this movie offers the kind of pre-holiday experience that parents and children alike will appreciate.__Everything you see in Arthur Christmas is fashioned in the service of telling a story ... brilliantly__The results are not only funny and fresh, but represent a new way of tackling the whole yuletide paradigm: Santa as a high-tech hereditary monarchy.__For the kids, the action is always lively and, for the rest of us, the dialogue has a witty and even caustic edge.__The surprise gift of the season: a sharp, savvy holiday comedy that doesn't get its laughs at the expense of those who start to glow in the early days of December. It's a most entertaining package indeed.__Good for the kids, good for the parents, and good for Christmas.__The premise recalls those sophisticated lies parents cook up when their kids start asking logical questions about Santa.__Unexpectedly fresh, despite the familiar-sounding premise.__An animated kiddie comedy that delivers all the wonder you'd expect in a movie about a guy delivering one package.__Hilarious, fast-paced and superbly entertaining.__It would be a Christmas miracle save for one lump of coal: an ear-shattering Justin Bieber song over the end credits.__Like most of Aardman's work ... [it's] more clever than outright funny, but it's also genuinely sweet, and the complicated relations among Santa's clan are surprisingly believable__It's a lovely bit of work.__Take it as you will: a special Christmastime treat, or a gift-wrapped cross-promotional fruitcake (um, thanks?) from Aardman's Hollywood partners.__What makes Arthur sing is that it plays as much like a family comedy as a holiday film.__If "Arthur Christmas" doesn't make you happy, I honestly don't know what's wrong with you.
The joke is supposed to be that it's sad to see these guys so desperate for a lay, but in truth, it's even sadder to see the brothers this desperate for a laugh.__Another chapter in the endless saga of American male infantilism.__There's something about Hall Pass that feels grosser than the usual Farrelly brothers comedy.__The usual string of hackneyed and largely laugh-free set-ups involving vulgar chat-up lines, hash brownies and a mad, jealous guy with a crowbar, all seemingly purpose-honed to appeal to devotees of 'The Hangover'.__A gross-out comedy about the perpetual immaturity of the American male that has, amazingly enough, a mature perspective.__Peter and Bobby Farrelly are gross-out artists in transition.__Everything feels forced. Nothing kills laughter faster than trying too hard.__The Farrellys have a distinct touch that carries their dubious premise across.__The film is rarely funny, pointedly tasteless (as if that's new), usually embarrassing and always bad.__It wastes a lot of energy to very little effect.__"Something about Mary" seems a lifetime ago.__The Farrellys hedged their bets on whether to take marital infidelity seriously, when what they ought to have done is go all-out with the vulgar, one-dimensional slapstick, and leave it at that.__Guys can be desperately pathetic creatures when it comes to the opposite sex.__The idea has been spun out to its fullest comic potential and the ultimate endorsement of monogamy is even more predictable.__Why do the Farrellys huff and puff and hem and haw and meander through a full third of the picture before the premise even clicks into low gear? At least the answer isn't long in coming: They don't have clue one where to go with it.__Haphazardly conceived, phlegmatically paced, lazily filmed and punctuated with gratuitous moments of sexual and scatological slapstick..__An occasionally funny comedy with slow stretches that has directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly returning to their trademark gross-out humor.__Ever catch yourself thinking, "Man, I wish beer commercials lasted just 104 minutes longer"?__Like the middle-aged dads in this flaccid fiasco, "Hall Pass" is a decade behind the curve of what's happening.__A problem with "Hall Pass," I think, is that both Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are affable, and the movie wants us to like them.
Michel Hazanavicius' black-and-white, mostly silent comedy The Artist is a gorgeously made curiosity -- a film that functions as a testament to its own obsession with other movies.__The whole thing is so damn clever and charming, it might just sneak off with Best Picture.__It isn't arty or intellectual, though it is artful and ingenious, and it's the rare crowd-pleaser that never feels obvious or pandering.__There is literally nothing wrong with it. I don't have a single nit to pick, minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me. It is pure magic from the first frame to the last.__You can't fault it as smart entertainment, which eschews parody to make a sincere tribute that also serves as cogent current commentary.__The movie ever fully shakes off its air of skillfully executed experiment, but it's spirited and charming nonetheless.__For a movie that is so much about technique, it's surprising how affecting the story is.__"The Artist" may be too cute to qualify as high art, but it's highly entertaining.__The Artist is the most surprising and delightful film of 2011.__A silent movie shot in sumptuous black-and-white, no less. A silent flick made with not a jot of distancing winking, but instead born of a heady affection for a bygone, very bygone, era of filmmaking.__It's a rocket to the moon fueled by unadulterated joy and pure imagination.__It's a gentle, wistful tale, but with an ending so joyous and movie-magical that you just might dance out of the theater. (I did.)__Strangely, wonderfully, The Artist feels as bold and innovative a moviegoing experience as James Cameron's bells-and-whistles Avatar did a couple of years ago.__"The Artist'' is a small, exquisitely-cut jewel in a style everyone assumes is 80 years out of date.__A beguiling tale about Hollywood's silent movie days that is itself silent, this made-in-L.A. French feature will charm cinephiles with its affection for one of the movies' golden ages.__This effort often manages to duplicate the magical pantomime of the era; a lovely scene in which Bejo drapes herself in the arms of a hung jacket as if it were a human lover could have come straight out of a Marion Davies picture.__The Artist is charming as all get-out, a delightful little movie about the movies.__"The Artist" is such an engaging, delightful film that, if you like movies, you will walk out of the theater with a smile. You just will; it's that inspired.__Is "The Artist" a screwball comedy? A sentimental melodrama? A spoof? Serious? What? Yes, yes, yes and yes.__Yes, it's virtually silent, it's black-and-white, and you might not know the leads. But if you don't take a chance on this film, we can't be friends any more.
A succession of would-be rousing cliches.__Soul Surfer seems simply too sugar-coated to be true.__You wonder why this movie isn't a documentary, rather than a synthetic feature film with the heroine's arm digitally removed.__Hamilton is played, blandly, by Anna Sophia Robb, and her devoted parents, less bland, are played by Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt. The surfing footage, much of it shot off the coast of Kauai, is not bland at all.__It's Bethany and Alana's friendship - its sturdiness and vulnerability, its laughs and sincere apologies - that rules the day.__A by-the-numbers biopic about young surfer Bethany Hamilton.__For plenty of family viewers, this film will catch a wave.__An inspiring tale, even when true, doesn't necessarily make for an inspiring movie.__Given the heroic subject, the movie is as thrilling as a dish of rice pudding, a made-for-TV-style effort that rides a wave of religious sentiment into theatres.__The swells of inspirational storytelling sometimes threaten to swamp the underlying inspirational story.__The flaw in the storytelling strategy of "Soul Surfer" is that it doesn't make Bethany easy to identify with. She's almost eerie in her optimism. Her religious faith is so unshaken, it feels taken for granted.__Shamelessly pandering to the elusive Christian family audience, a committee of 18 producers and seven writers has removed nearly every trace of grit from this airbrushed portrait.__It's a compelling tale of surf and survival.__Its bubbling optimism and spectacular scenery are hard not to like.__Bethany's determination and faith are remarkable. It's too bad this movie made a brave young woman's life appear like an unremarkable soap opera.__The surfer's story is so made-for-cinema that a complete wipeout seems almost impossible. And yet the filmmakers come pretty close.__As a portrait of a spirited, resilient athlete, the movie succeeds best, unafraid to face its heroine's daunting challenges directly.__Though it flirts with saccharine Sunday-school uplift, there's a redeeming core of sincerity in this story of real-life tragedy and perseverance.__The best moments come when Robb's all-purpose toughness experiences vulnerable doubt. These moments are flickers, but they're bright and human.__Somewhere not far beneath the glossy pop skin of Soul Surfer, the true story of Bethany Hamilton is struggling to get out.
Stabs at the dramatic don't amount to anything that makes us care, even for Bell, who has been solid on AMC's The Walking Dead and in the chairlift chiller Frozen.__It sticks to gimmicky scenes in which twentysomethings are dispatched in ingenious ways, but first-time director Steven Quayle delivers cheap fun that will keep fans happy.__A surprising infusion of energy and macabre humor reanimates this horror franchise.__The death sequences are fun; unfortunately, nearly everything in between is tedious and mechanical.__Director Steven Quale stages the death scenes with intermittently effective black humour to juice up a premise that, essentially, has all the suspense of watching the line at an abattoir.__Under the direction of James Cameron protege Steven Quayle, the visual effects from Ariel Velasco Shaw (who has crafted mayhem on everything from 300 to Freddy vs. Jason) ensure that no industrial hook through a skull is left unimagined.__So tapped into its audience's giddy schadenfreude that beyond a kinkier-than-usual jolt of black humor and some clever red herrings, the formula remains rote...__From the opening credits to the final kill this film displays a great use of 3-D.__A long and eventually tedious series of deaths, all in slightly sickening 3-D. Splattered eyeballs, snapped spines, heart kebabs - one numbingly after another, in diamond-hard focus and ruby-red color.____A suspenseful and macabre exercise in dread for the absurdly cosseted.__First-time feature director Steven Quale has brought this anemic franchise back to life, with an unexpected infusion of humor and energy.__Stick a fork in the Final Destination franchise - probably something that's been done in some variation to a poor slob in every one of the ongoing series. It's done.__"Final Destination 5" is irresistible, and the reason it's irresistible is that it speaks to us in the language we all understand, which is fear.__The Godfather II it isn't, but for teens with money to burn, there are worse options to curdle blood.__A new wrinkle in how the killings spool out actually makes the film even more predictable, and the deaths, which tend to be squirmy rather than explosive, are so perfunctory and lazily jokey that they leave a decidedly bad aftertaste.__An anemic installment in the decade-old series that seems content with giving viewers more of the same.__"FD 5" did not raise even a single goose bump - which for a movie that bills itself as horror is not a good thing.__I'd venture to say it's the best Final Destination sequel - if you gauge success by overall shock value.__Final Destination 5 starts with an R-rated 3D bang, but the cheap thrills wear off way fast, and we're left with atrocious acting, feeble writing and clueless directing.
__At its best, the film is like a political version of Sweet Smell of Success, another movie where the corruption was so rampant it gleamed.__As for Clooney, when he steps from behind the camera, his candidate exudes an easy, judicious authority.__This is intelligent filmmaking, and a provocative moral fable. It may not be perfect, but it stands as one of the better, most realistic movies about the way we elect our leaders.__From the film's ideological vantage point, moderate Democrats are Machiavellian devils, and Republicans are an inconceivable evil looming on a distant horizon, like the White Walkers in Game of Thrones.__The Ides of March is a well-made actors showcase and fine film. But it never finds that more.__Just about every other scene in the film is a simple pleasure unto itself between the equally confident writing, direction and performances.__Smart and solidly entertaining, thanks to one of the year's top ensemble casts working at the top of its game.__Clooney does a good job opening up the ideas Willimon first explored onstage, but the result is still a pessimistic truth so universally acknowledged that it doesn't bear repeating, however stylishly.__It's great fun for us to see an entertaining movie we can watch without guilt.__Almost a political drama of the caliber of Gore Vidal's "The Best Man," but it's not quite. However, it is the movie to recommend to adults looking for something that's topical and intelligent and that will keep them guessing.__Clooney has a keen eye for a good story. With this, his fourth turn as a director, he has chosen wisely.__Beware The Ides of March. This slick political thriller, the fourth directorial effort of the velvet-voiced heartthrob and aspiring auteur George Clooney, adds up to less than it appears to be at first glance, or even the first several glances.__The Ides of March, George Clooney's despairing political drama set against the backdrop of a bruising Ohio Democratic primary, presents us with a most unsentimental education.__The problem is that the news the story brings may be perfectly accurate, but it isn't particularly original, and it's certainly not what we hunger for in these dispiriting, cynical times.__The cast of George Clooney's political thriller "The Ides of March" is so good, you could probably enjoy watching this movie with the sound off.__Even though all the supporting elements of a superior film are here, the actual plot that everything is at the service of is disappointing. The texture of reality and the sheen of fine craft disguise this for a while, but not forever.__The Ides of March is a pulse-racing thriller that hits where it hurts. Clooney's performance is exceptional and Gosling is terrific in an all-stops-out role.__Clooney is perfectly cast as a charmer with a dark edge, and Giamatti and Hoffman are excellent as two sides of the same tarnished coin.__The Ides of March wields its searchlight over our political landscape and finds a battlefield: a bloody ground of cynicism and fatal compromise.
While the film as a whole may be episodic and wayward, and not always in a good way, the action scenes are uniformly sharp, inventive and gripping.__An entertainingly nutty action thriller from the director Joe Wright.__Blessed with considerable virtues, including a clever concept, crackling filmmaking and a charismatic star, it ultimately squanders all of them, undone by an unfortunate lack of subtlety and restraint.__What keeps us hooked is Ronan, a young actress of seemingly limitless abilities, and the tension she creates between Hanna's inhumanly agile body and quizzical eyes, which turn cold only when she pulls the trigger.__This film is bound to give the home-schooling movement a bad name, unless, of course, you're running a home school for assassins.__"Hanna" plays out as a visceral fairy tale about a naif discovering a world both fascinating and dangerous.__Saoirse Ronan is a talented young actress who tends to be better than the movies she's in. And that tendency holds true with "Hanna," an unsteady thriller that staggers when it should sprint.__I gave up trying to keep track of the plot and wondered, Just what the hell is going on here?__Hanna is far from perfect but, courtesy of star Saoirse Ronan and director Joe Wright, it's one of those imperfect pictures that manages to command and hold our attention straight from the opening frames.__The forced coming-of-age parable that filmmaker Joe Wright laces with fairy-tale symbolism is heavy-handed from the get-go.__The film is never more than an amalgamation of other movies.__Is it a great movie? No. Nagging questions and plot holes start appearing the minute the endorphins and adrenaline wear off. But it isn't a bad one, either.__This J.V. "Salt" is effective only for a few minutes at a time, in some occasionally ripping action scenes set to a vivid Chemical Brothers score.__An intriguing enough remix of well-established assassin-on-the-run routine whose greatest asset is its young star.__It's a feast for the eyes, but we're still hungry.__"Hanna" is, on a certain level, ridiculous. But the way Mr. Wright conjures his images and parcels out his narrative is hypnotic and so seductive that wherever the film is heading we want to follow.__A movie that, in the end, is no smarter than any other run-of-the-mill cinematic death fest, just grimmer, bleaker and sadder.__Too concerned with looking adult than being mature, and that's a death sentence for an action wannabe.__A chase-thriller for the art-house crowd, Hanna is brisk, satisfying and often surprising.__Although its camera moves are fluid and its art direction elegant, Hanna doesn't travel anyplace unusual. The point of all its battling is just to battle.
The movie is merely a joke-stoked soap opera; its bare-bones plot leaves the characters unrealized and the situations undefined.__The film seems to think that we will find something entertaining about Darcy just because she's played by Kate Hudson. It's hard to imagine a worse miscalculation.__"Inept and implausible in almost every way, Something Borrowed is the smug rom-com answer to the Apatowian man-child comedy."__The movie strains far too hard to make what Rachel and Dex have done all right, as if their guilty anguish - and the movie's saccharine score - frees us to root for them.__In Something Borrowed, Kate Hudson looks exhausted, as if she is as tired of wading through another one of her feckless duds as we are of watching them.__"Something Borrowed" is something ... ew.__Even if you've got a soft spot for silly rom-coms, know that this one is as empty-headed as it gets.__The sisterhood is already grumbling about a movie that suggests women will happily choose a mate over friendship, but actually it's the stereotypes of good behaviour rather than bad that bring this rom com crashing down.__The half-star rating goes to John Krasinski for heroically rising above this vile dung heap of a movie.__Would be wholly unbearable if it weren't for Krasinski, who is on the scene with his goofy, bulbous nose and perfect comedic timing to partially redeem the almost unwatchable.__The script and direction are by-the-numbers at best and Goodwin's hairstyles tend to be distractingly awful.__A predictable romantic comedy with cookie-cutter characters - the nerdy professional with a mean-girl best friend, both vying for a stoic lawyer who secretly wants to be a teacher.__The big moral issues, the deception and lies? Blown off, like so much sand on the deck. After all, if you're a rich, young, white American, what's a bit of hanky-panky among friends?__It's mainly interested in hurtling from one cute set piece to the next, plausibility and/or 'organic' character development be damned.__A genial cast and moderately funny script prevail over the sort of sappy music cues and white-bread settings that have become the grating norm in Hollywood rom-coms.__Goodwin radiates probity and makes waiting almost look interesting, and so, for all the movie's awkwardness, it remains watchable. But she's waiting for something that's not worth waiting for, not for her and not for us.__Bonds are tested and feelings hurt, but who really cares? The story takes predictable turns, embraces cliches and dodges all humor.__Krasinski is, once again, the best thing about a romantic comedy.__The most dispiriting thing about "Something Borrowed" is that with a little more art, craft and wit it could have been a lot better, maybe even good.__A film that fails to dramatize its intriguing premise.
Scream's brand of horror, which lampooned the slasher genre while simultaneously embracing it, was fun and breezy in 1996. In 2011, it's about as fresh as the whiff of something stale and rank from a crypt.__Craven guides us expertly down a series of blind, bloody alleys, a journey that's more pleasurable than frustrating. On account of his steady hand, the last act is as good as could be expected: skillfully conceived and entertaining in its preposterousness__Scream 4 is a total hoot. Assuming you can find the humor in knife stabbings.__Compared with so many of the rebooted slasher flicks, Scream 4 remains a cut above. No, that is not an intended pun.__On its own terms, Scre4m is pretty good.__A perfectly acceptable Friday night, Scream 4 delivers plenty of scares without consequences, murder without depth, and a flood of legacy laughs.__Between a diabolically funny start and a surprise climax, Scream 4 offers nothing more than a series of gory deaths that grow tiresome with repetition.__Not even the smug irony endures -- it's hard to congratulate yourself for being in on a stale joke.__"Scream" always made fun of itself even as it was frightening us - and that hasn't changed a bit.__Relying on obvious cliches doesn't seem ironic anymore, just easy. And though there are several genuine jolts, poor pacing leaves too much time between the silliness and scares.__The problem is, the movie doesn't really care if we are laughing with it or at it.__The "Scream 4" (I refuse to write it the other way anymore) drinking game: Take a slug every time someone on-screen remarks how meta it all is.__Like its predecessors, "Scream 4" replaces the values of storytelling and suspense with the value of being in on the joke. Unfortunately, in the 11 years since "Scream 3," the joke has gotten pretty old.__The filmmakers' subtext - at least in the movie's first quarter - seems to acknowledge that you can't top the original. And they didn't.__"Scream 4" is a strange concoction, clever and self-knowing in the extreme and yet operating in primal ways that bypass wit. Something about it feels very modern.__Though director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson don't quite generate the lightning-in-a-bottle energy that made their first Scream movie a hit, they manage to awaken a 15-year-old slasher franchise that has been dormant for a decade.__This is quite effective as horror filmmaking and more pungent than anything [Craven's] done in a while.__"Scream 4" finds a way to live up to its gory past while it carves out new terrors in new ways (new media helps).__Fifteen years in, the series now looks more than ever like a Mobius strip that reflects on itself in a perpetual loop. But meta-arbitrary is still arbitrary.__The sardonic laughs are mostly gone in this wheezing cash cow and the cries don't resonate. The greatest shocks are the ones facing the now middle-aged main actors when they look into the mirror.
Looking back, it's strange to remember that the first two movies were both hits, and that Paul Giamatti and Terrence Howard even saw enough in the premise to sign up for the original. At this point, it's really all just flab.__An assessment of the film as part of a dissertational examination of Lawrence's contribution to comedic posterity and to African-American cultural history will surely note that the film was not pre-screened for critics in advance.__Even Big Momma deserves better than this.__It seems fair to point out that of all the cross-dressing comedies of recent decades, none has channeled Some Like It Hot quite so thoroughly.__A film so drained of entertainment or simple humanity it is difficult to relate to as anything other than industrial artifact.__If Tyler Perry finds liberation in lipstick, Lawrence has become suffocated by Spanx.__Lawrence's gender-bending jokes are played out, and his slapstick is wooden and slow. It's understandable: Clowning around underneath that fat suit must be exhausting. Almost as much as watching it.__There's little that is fresh and nothing at all inventive about scenes involving the brandishing and firing of guns, the unfunny excesses of a putatively comical car chase, and the repetitious sass and brass of Big Momma's life lessons.__[This] extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial cliches.__This is not a case of doubling the fun so much as an anxious attempt to revive a franchise running out of gas.__The airless Matthew Fogel-Don Rhymer script makes one long for the snark and sass of Madea.__Quite how this flaccid, one-joke crime-comedy franchise even got off the ground is a mystery.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Yes, there's enough connection with the source's underlying issues of repression and desire to give this reason to exist, but, boy, does Hardwicke labour in getting from fairy tale to would-be psycho-thriller.__More "Twilight" than Grimm, and a terrible mess.__Hardwicke directed Twilight, you'll recall, and would apparently like to continue directing it, over and over again.__Catherine Hardwicke is Anne Rice with a camera.__Just when you think you've finished with one of these annoying franchises, another one pops up to plague you.__If you're a Twilight fan, you may feel as though you've already seen this. And if you're not, well, why would you be interested in something like this at all?__Not nearly suspenseful enough to pass as a horror film, Red Riding Hood is an awkward supernatural whodunit weighed down by banal dialogue more suited to a teen soap and Hardwicke's clumsy direction.__Red Riding Hood is pretty decent, considering it's, you know, Red Riding Hood.__Red Riding Hood has the added inconvenience of being dreadfully serious about a plot so preposterous, it demands to be filmed by Monty Python.__You'll howl alright; this is the funniest movie I've seen all year. Yes, it's supposed to be a horror flick.__What big eyes and lips Amanda Seyfried has. And what nice cheekbones Julie Christie, who plays her grandmother, has. Unfortunately, these are about the only outstanding features in Red Riding Hood.__"Red Riding Hood" is such a sorrowful attempt to resurrect the marketing magic of "Twilight" that it ought to be titled "Career Eclipse."__Hardwicke, whose first "Twilight" film looks like "Citizen Kane" with fangs compared to this, takes things sooo seriously, which translates as buffoonery.__[Hardwicke] has a gift for taking situations of bloodcurdling thrills and investing them with all of the drama of a sophomore fussing over her prom date.__A lurid, loopy, utterly ludicrous enterprise that seeks to twist the ultimate fable of feminine fear and victimhood into an allegory for finding your inner bad girl.__But, my, what sharp teeth Ms. Hardwicke doesn't have.__Was Red Riding Hood masterminded by a cadre of particularly silly eleven year-olds undergoing withdrawal from Twilight? That's the only excuse for a movie this dopey.__A foolish story, marred by a strange blend of overacting and bland, offhand performances.__Overheated yet underpowered.__The result is a dolled-up, overblown, pandering romantic costume drama that's not only sillier than the filmmakers surely intended but also, if you follow the plot implications all the way to the end, way ickier, too.
Well, that's one joke. Ninety more minutes to go.__The film has some laughs. But it also has a million jokes about anal probes, alien genitalia, and people thinking Clive and Graeme are gay. These guys can do better than this.__The CGI alien is very well articulated, and Rogen is a virtuoso at mixing motormouthed rudeness with a hint of tenderness to take off the edge.__Paul is arguably the best science fiction comedy since Galaxy Quest.__This is not quite enough of a conceit to sustain a full-length movie -- Paul would have made a terrific short film -- but there are incidental pleasures all along the way.__A good-hearted, funny movie.__The results, it must be said, are less hi-larious than sporadically mid-to-low-larious.__In the end - as well as the middle and maybe even at the outset - Paul is more often a close encounter of the middling kind.__The results are, again, not-quite-brilliant but funny enough.__Beam us up, Scotty. There's no intelligent life here.__'Paul' is more a bagful of giggles. Rogen is a nonstop hoot, but it's the byplay between Frost and Pegg that roots the laughs in characters we care about.__It's more than occasionally cute, if less than consistently clever.__What has happened to Pegg? Why does he mug so? Why can't he relax and let the audience come to him, rather than auditioning for our affection with every reaction shot?__Set your humor-detection capacitors for moderate to above-average intake levels. I haven't laughed this much since maybe last Monday, but that was a particularly strong Monday.__How could so many talented people collaborate on something so dull?__While Frost is particularly well-cast, most of the actors seem to be having fun. You will, too, as long as you arrive with lowered expectations.__Here's a movie that teeters on the edge of being really pretty good and loses its way.__What makes the film largely work, despite its occasional slackness and over-trodden terrain, is its overall affability (and smutty words).__This is a well-made, well-plotted and sensitive movie.__After the sharp bite and harsh light of most American-style guy-based funny films today, "Paul" comes as such sweet relief.
The Hoover material is ugly and very American, and it might have made an authentic monster story. But the picture offered is muddled, cautious, and at cross purposes.__A pleasing, intelligent film happy to describe Hoover's behaviour as monstrous but too balanced and searching to damn him as a monster.__Somehow J. Edgar manages to be both epic and empty.__Usually the tautest of directors, Clint Eastwood has gone all slack here, allowing his subject to get completely away from him.__Although Hoover's luster faded as his career went on, Eastwood's movie seems wan from the start.__Here's that J. Edgar Hoover biopic you asked for, or at least something that meets all the technical requirements to be considered one.__Mr. Eastwood's ponderous direction, a clumsy script by Dustin Lance Black and ghastly slatherings of old-age makeup all conspire to put the story at an emotional and historical distance. It's a partially animated waxworks.__How believable is DiCaprio? When I first heard he had been cast as Hoover, I couldn't think of another actor physically less likely to pull it off. But he's surprisingly good.__Within the sprawling biopic that is J. Edgar beats the heart of a love story.__For all its virtues -- or, perhaps, because of them -- J. Edgar is a disappointment.__This far-from-perfect film is hobbled by uneven performances and a script studded with historical bullet points. But it's a strong tribute to Eastwood's personal vision.__J. Edgar is an arduous trek through the history books, a gloomy glide down the marble halls of a Washington institution.__That "J. Edgar'' never ultimately convinces - that at times it's quite entertainingly bad - can be blamed on both an unfocused script and the project's very bigness.__[DiCaprio] digs into the role of Hoover with relish and commitment__It's gratifying to see an old bully outed as a hypocrite, but by distracting us from bigger crimes, "J. Edgar" is a public enemy.__Eastwood's prim, respectful biography presents Hoover in turn as a muddy political metaphor, a lesson in self-mythologizing, and a case history in repression, but never particularly as a man.__"J. Edgar" too often feels like the rough draft of the great movie it could have been; a character sketch, not quite a portrait.__DiCaprio wrings truth out of a cipher. The Hoover of both headline and whispers comes into sharp relief in this Oscar-beckoning performance.__Whether unintentionally or by design, the movie never really makes a case either for or against the troubled figure at its center.__This may be a closety film about a closety character, but the tensions between Eastwood's direction and the script he's directing keep us off-guard in an intriguing way. The results, whatever one thinks of them, may be square, but they're all of a piece.
This is trash of the tamest variety which elicits a few mild shudders at most.__Kelly and Meester hit their marks and look pretty doing it, while supporting players Cam Gigandet, Billy Zane and Aly Michalka fade into the background so blandly that viewers will never remember they were there.__The movie is exploitative schlock; both its&#8232; stars -- particularly Meester, who has something, although she herself has &#8232;perhaps not yet figured out what -- deserve better.&#8232;__"The Roommate'' is dumb about psychology and suspense.__The Roommate - the umpteenth uncredited remake of 1992's Single White Female - sucks bad, real bad.__We could not possibly care less.__It's exactly what you thought it would be: A plagiarized, campus-set Single White Female pitched to teens, The Roommate traces over scenes from Barbet Schroeder's sleepover classic with no notable improvement.__It's the stuff of a late-night channel-surfer's dreams. The film's sure-to-be-brief theatrical release is a mere stopover on the way to basic-cable eternity.__Unfortunately, The Roommate is too timid to make an impression of any kind.__Its most fiendish moment comes when one girl yanks out another's bellybutton ring. Not that -- anything but that!__With few scares and minimal characterization, The Roommate is really just a far-below-par thriller that desperately wishes it were a different movie -- a longing it shares with the audience.__If ever a thriller were to inspire a collective "eh," it's got to be "The Roommate." It's not a good movie, by any means, but it's also not bad enough to have fun hating on.__Without tension or suspense, the film is too gloomy and chaste to be a naughty exploitation picture but also too brainless to work as anything more real.__Innocent young college girl moves in with psycho roommate. You know the rest.__Won't evict "Single White Female" from its top-floor residence among psycho-roomie cinema.__It's a lazy, bloodless, pointless, boring piece of work, lacking even the conviction to deliver a little cheap exploitation.__Danish director Christian E. Christiansen does nothing remotely chilling iwth the visuals or the tempo, so the movie leans heavily on John Frizzell's strident string-heavy score. Even efforts at playing the titillation game with his stars feel meek and PG.__None__None__None
Class differences and family resentments add to the hubbub surrounding an African-American wedding on Martha's Vineyard in this perceptive, faith-based romantic comedy.__It shouldn't seem as novel as it does.__"The comedy is as familiar as the ceremony at a cookie-cutter wedding factory: Much feels old or borrowed; nothing feels new."__"Jumping the Broom" combines tried-and-true oil-water class tensions with the challenges of modern romance and family, then adds some African-American flavors.__It's fun at times, if a bit over-dramatic and a lot over-the-top. But by the end, you're ready for it to be over.__True, the script overreaches, crammed with too many characters, subplots and stereotypes. But at least it's trying. And at least there isn't a phony in the bunch.__Proof that you can have a movie like this without a polemic against successful women, or some man in a dress threatening to take off his earrings and pull out a gun.__It's relatively raunch-free, it has a sparkling cast that reunites Waiting to Exhale stars Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine as combative matriarchs, and it likes its characters well enough to forgive them their faults.__"Broom" doesn't take any risks or offer many surprises. But then, do most weddings?__What prevents the film from being a real crowd-pleaser, the Philadelphia Story that it clearly wants to be, are the marrying couple.__Instead of being a wild mixture of tones, it has very little tone at all, and moments of dramatic or comic intensity erupt awkwardly and then fizzle out.__No matter how crazy you think your mother is, it can't get much worse than this.__It's the snobs against the slobs at a Martha's Vineyard wedding in "Jumping the Broom." Mostly, it's a tie: Both sides are equally irritating.__The film's main thread, the class clashes, simply aren't enough to make this unnecessary movie worthwhile.__When the sushi-vs.-soul-food jokes wear thin, this film is carried by its universal themes, such as parenting, commitment, sacrifice and loss.__... a perfectly acceptable rom-com ... may not get too high off the ground, but it does, as they say, stick the landing, and that's good enough.__The humor arises naturally from situations, but the story teeters into melodrama. Still, watching impressive actors like Bassett and Devine face off is a highlight.__Every wedding comedy hinges on creating threats to the union, of course, but Hunter and Gibbs pile on half a dozen potentially ruinous scenarios and subplots where one or two would have been sufficient.__A picture that gave me considerable satisfaction, partly because it wears its themes of trust and belief and faith lightly and easily, while taking them seriously.__The bride and groom are in love, but their families are not. That was good enough for "Romeo and Juliet," and it still sorta works with "Jumping the Broom."
You'd have to call the whole undertaking workmanlike rather than inspired.__Pee-pee humor abounds in The Change-Up. There's also a lot of poo-poo humor. And ta-ta humor.__This comedy doesn't work very well.__It's occasionally funny and a lot painful...__The Change-Up goes downhill faster than a snowboarder strapped to a jetpack.__Bateman, as always, is surpassingly good, even when the material isn't.__With slight variants, this is another chapter in the epic saga of body shame, gender panic, and free-floating contempt for the human race that Hollywood comedies seem to be issuing piece by piece in serial format.__A thoroughly silly, intermittently hilarious reworking of the Freaky Friday body-switch concept.__The script values shock over wit so completely that every scene feels too eager for laughs, even with comic actors as likable as Bateman and Reynolds doing the shocking.__Freaky, yes, but definitely not Freaky Friday.__Universal Pictures has filed for creative bankruptcy.__Bateman and Reynolds never get into the hall-of-mirrors mimicry that Nicolas Cage and John Travolta so enjoyed in "Face/Off."__Another body-switching comedy? Seriously?__The thing is, this could have been funny.__As in Judd Apatow's phallocentric comic fantasies, the considerable raunch and implicit sexism of "The Change-Up" barely mask a worldview that's far from transgressive.__Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds struggle valiantly to transcend the movie they're in.__I want to hate The Change-Up for its relentless scatology, its imaginative bankruptcy, its juvenile need to push every superficial content restriction to the outer limits.__While this raunchy Freaky Friday meets Trading Places has some laughs, it's more often frat-boy crass, frantic and formulaic.__Talented people all, and either prisoners of the studio system, which will do anything it takes to reach an audience, or willing players in a soiled playpen.__Delivers consistent laughs, some sincerely touching moments.
The film contains a remarkable level of violence, yet never establishes a tone that would make it seem funny or truly shocking; the jokes flounder in an air of half-hearted spite.__It's funny, clever and pacy to a fault, and the script more than satisfies its quota of decent zings.__It never reconciles the meticulous intelligence needed to build the weaponry and the monstrous stupidity needed to use it.__Probably has the approximate cultural staying power of its title.__The dark, biting comedy often strays into territory that can be categorized as politically incorrect, but the result is funny, engaging, and at times a little disconcerting.__The movie belongs to Ansari, who steals nearly every scene he is in with his jangly, nervous intensity.__This is disappointing news, given that the director of this sputter-rev-sputter ride is Ruben Fleischer&#8203; and that nattering Jesse Eisenberg stars.__It's a bit like the Three Stooges on crack -- nutty, loud, profane and full of laughs. It won't change your life and it might hurt your ears, but it should keep you smiling.__In a year lousy with badly written movies filled with phallic fixations, it's a relief to watch one that is happy to be rude good fun without excessive raunch.__From the premise to the performances, everything and everybody just seems to be trying way too hard.__One of the great disappointments of my cinematic year so far.__The film's running time and sudden ending suggest a desperate last-minute edit to cut anything that wasn't working. They stopped too soon.__For a soul-sucking 83 minutes, you're trapped inside the film's tiny, ugly mind.__"30 Minutes or Less" may be tasteless, moronic and lacking in any redeeming social value whatsoever. But for me, at least, it was gut-bustingly funny -- perhaps this waning summer season's ultimate guilty pleasure.__Beholding Eisenberg in Fleischer's relentlessly vulgar and un-funny "30 Minutes or Less" is akin to watching a ring-tested champion punch far below his weight. What a comedown.__Either it goes for a particular tone and doesn't achieve it. Or it does achieve a tone that's not really worth striving for.__30 Minutes wallows in stupidity without making the bromance bonds believable.__At a mere 83 minutes, 30 Minutes or Less might seem able to deliver on the promise of its zippy title. Instead, this slackers-go-gangsta comedy demonstrates that less than 90 minutes can be a very long time.__How disappointing to see Oscar-nominated Jesse Eisenberg and his "Zombieland" director, Ruben Fleischer, reunited in a low-rent slob comedy.__The movie claims to be only 83 minutes long, but it's the longest 83 minutes to come along in quite awhile.
Tiresome and unconvincing.__Often improbable, sometimes ludicrous, but frequently exciting.__Possibly worth seeing if you are 13.__There's bad acting all around, but you can't fully blame the performers. The dialogue needed a writer to come in and punch it up - the lines sound like placeholders.__Colombiana isn't the last word in action movies, but it's a fun ride.__Megaton blows things up, demolishes a fruit market, and throws in some parkour foot-chases as if he's completing a checklist.__Colombiana isn't completely dreadful, if you ignore the holes in its Swiss cheese of a plot.__We all love a steamy pile of frivolous nonsense now and then, but it has to move quickly or we lose interest, like a joke that stops being funny.__Thinly textured and technically proficient, with a cartoonishness that takes it out of the real world.__It turns into the same silly stuff we've seen before, a dish of revenge served not so much cold as reheated.__Luc Besson keeps ralphing up scripts about beautiful lady killers, but that doesn't mean you have to keep seeing them.__Zoe Saldana makes being an action hero look so easy in "Colombiana," you have to wonder why more actresses don't try it.__Luc Besson has decided to make one for the girls.__This is a showy flower of an action film. Saldana doesn't get much of a chance to emote, but her action skills blossom.__There are some early comic moments that have you laughing along with the movie, but eventually the clashing tones and preposterousness just have you laughing.__All killers should look this good doing their dirty work. It'd be a better world.__Is Saldana the new Schwarzenegger, only leaner, meaner and much better looking in spandex? I think so.__A movie so addicted to the crack pipe of delirious cinematic badness that it has real potential as a camp classic.__The results are so clumsy and over-the-top that they should have just called the movie Panty Assassin and played the whole thing for laughs.__For the most part, it's all big and silly, but at least it's enjoyably staged and crafted.
Gun-toting hotties combat assorted villains and their robot henchmen in this tawdry, repellent action fantasy.__Snyder likes to think that his Russian nesting doll of a concept is enough to excuse its hollow center.__The movie spins out of control, until it collapses in a heap, senseless.__Snyder pulverises our senses with derivative digital images and obvious musical choices. But his failure to delineate the levels of 'reality' is confusing and self-defeating.__This movie isn't bad in the way some incompetently made movies are bad; this is bad because there's much skill evident in a pointless endeavor.__A series of extravagant computer-generated adventure scenarios linked by grim mental hospital plot, Sucker Punch represents a particularly ambitious exercise in tedium.__Director Zack Snyder and his production crew clearly had great fun envisioning this swords-and-corsets fantasy. Few others are likely to approach their level of enjoyment.__The suckers here are the poor mugs who leave their dollars at the door. And for what? A seedy, desaturated, overstimulated simulation of a real movie. Schlock treatment for comatose gamers, and a bomb with a bright pink cherry on top.__The movie is like an arrested adolescent's Google search run amok.__Map! Fire! Knife! Key! (Well, eat drink man woman to you too, honey.)__If the goal was sensory overload and audience stupefaction, he has succeeded indeed. Snyder apparently is offering lobotomies to all. Step right up.__So thoroughly labored, and panders so relentlessly to adolescent attitudes and fantasies, and is so thoroughly and stridently humorless, that it kind of sucks out your soul while you're watching it.__For pure filmmaking - characters taking up half the foreground in close-up while events unfold behind them, action speeding up or stopping on command, a soundtrack of classic rock remixed or redone into droning trances - it's remarkable.__A surprisingly joyless mash-up of every bit of fanboy flotsam floating around in its maker's cranium.__Looks aren't everything. Case in point: Sucker Punch, a dazzling visual design that goes tone-deaf every time it opens its dumb mouth or makes claims to profundity.__An indecipherable, hypocritical mess that proves you can fill a movie with scantily-clad women with big guns and it can still bore one to tears.__"Sucker Punch" is what happens when a studio gives carte blanche to a filmmaker who has absolutely nothing original or even coherent to say.__Zombie soldiers, dragons, cyborgs, doesn't matter: Snyder is just a big boy with lots of toys. These, unfortunately, include his actresses.__My personal rule of film enjoyment goes a little like this: you can be miserable or pointless, but you can't be both. Sucker Punch works hard to be both.__I can't be sure whether it's brilliant or idiotic, although I'm pretty confident it's both, and not always in different places or at different moments.
An exceedingly minor entry on already impressive resumes.__To pluck romantic comedy from the jaws of a social crisis is a laudable project, worthy of Preston Sturges, and it's a pity that this featherlight drama-written by Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos, and directed by Hanks himself-should falter in its task.__Larry Crowne is more than a missed opportunity. It's alarmingly, depressingly out of touch.__Even if you wander into this congealed mess with nothing more demanding in mind than to spend a little time with two charming favorites, do not expect Forrest Gump or Pretty Woman.__Neither fish nor fowl, Larry Crowne skitters between pathos and shtick, wasting abundant acting talent as it goes.__When it comes to unemployment-themed cinema, I'll take the greater realism of last year's The Company Men or this year's Everything Must Go over Hanks's too rosy vision of life after the pink slip.__The film is sometimes gentle to the point of blandness, but it's never flimsy.__It's about as close to real comedy as a cup of milky tea is to a real meal.__Neither the relationship of the two leads, nor any encounter between any of the film's other humans, seems to proceed according to the emotional or sociological customs of our culture.__Larry Crowne doesn't come close to providing the rom-com satisfactions of films attached to the names Hanks and Roberts, or writer Nia Vardalos for that matter.__This is film as comfort food, and even if it has very little nutritional value, its pleasantly bland texture will help keep you occupied until your next job interview or layoff notice.__Next semester, the stars should drop Speech 217 and enroll in Chemistry 101 -- they dearly need some.__It's enough that these two castaways are friends, but I guess friendship doesn't cut it when you're trying to create a star-driven hit. It should, though. Better a believable friendship than an unbelievable love affair.__Corny beyond belief, but a welcome relief from a summer filled with CGI, 3-D and sequels. The two leads are enormously charming.__You wonder who thought any of this was funny.__The real reason to watch this modestly charming, featherweight bauble is the chemistry between Hanks and Roberts, beloved superstars who make a beautiful pair.__As romantic comedies go, "Larry Crowne" is neither swooningly romantic nor howlingly funny.__If you're looking for a movie you can take your parents or young children to without fear of embarrassment or the need for endless explanations, this is the one.__Hanks directs with assurance. Perhaps if he had teamed with a more agile writer, less given to cheesy yuck-fests, Larry Crowne would be the nuanced adult love story it aims to be.__Hanks, as a writer-director, is talking about real things, even if he isn't depicting them with complete honesty.
What it had going for it was an uncanny and moving relationship between Gosling and Mulligan.__Sure, it's shallow, but it's also slickly compelling, beautifully crafted and so damn shiny.__In grabbing our attention, [Refn] diverts it from what matters. The horror lingers and seeps; the feelings are sponged away.__The extreme and escalating violence will prove off-putting to some-frankly, I'm surprised not to have been among them-but for the rest, Drive is a needle-punch of adrenaline to the aorta.__In reworking genres without quoting shamelessly, Refn proves himself his own man and a guy quite capable of taking us places we didn't even know we wanted to go.__Drive is pedal-to-the-metal stuff. Don't get behind the wheel unless you can take the rush.__This is no antic-frantic affair; instead, it's a cerebral game of stop-and-go, hide-and-seek, as the director behind the camera handles things exactly like the guy behind the wheel - with a stylish mixture of cold calculation and cool aplomb.__The pace of this film is a beautiful thing to behold, as Drive is a patient but taut thriller.__For stone-cold, retro action fans who are tired of all these over-edited, underachieving thrillers - well, here's one car chase movie that isn't running on empty.__Anyone watching Drive won't be able to take their eyes off Gosling. Playing a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a wheelman for criminals, he rocks like a young Steve McQueen or Robert De Niro.__Gosling and director Nicolas Winding Refn neatly manage the hat trick of paying homage to those wheelmen of yore while reinvigorating the genre with style, smarts and flashes of wit.__It's fun, but the script, credited to Hossein Amini ("The Wings of the Dove"), is short on characterization and long on plot twists and wisecracks.__It's a film in love with both traditional noir mythology and ultra-modern violence, a combination that is not ideal.__The look is artfully stylized, influenced by classic film noir; the mood is dark; the performances nuanced; and the story unnervingly exciting.__Mainstream audiences will probably be confounded by "Drive," while lovers of gritty filmmaking will defend every exaggerated shotgun wound as art. Know which camp you're in before you enter the theater.__For all the movement in Drive, the quiet, deathly still moments are the ones that count.__The first half of Drive unfolds like a romantic reverie.__Tasty, if sketchy, modern noir with car chases and bloody action that should turn the trick for genre-seeking audiences.__[Gosling] and this powerful film, which is ultimately about a moment of grace, deserve each other. He's the medium's most graceful minimalist.__To invest oneself emotionally in the central relationship, or the movie itself, would be akin to investing oneself emotionally in one's car. But when the car looks this good and drives this fast, why not?
50/50 is about right.__Add 50/50 to your want to see list. And then make an appointment for your annual physical with your doctor.__Still, it's Gordon-Levitt's choices that continue to impress. Sure, he owned one of the most jaw-dropping sequences in last summer's blockbuster Inception. But the actor remains drawn to profoundly human-scale hurts and quiet triumphs.__Gordon-Levitt is an agreeably undemonstrative actor who plays well opposite the burbly Rogen.__Chances are about 90/10 that you'll enjoy 50/50.__Scene by scene, 50/50 can be both amusing and moving, with the tightly wound Gordon-Levitt and the boundaryless Rogen forming an oddly complementary pair. But as a whole the movie never quite coheres.__In other hands, Adam might well be hard to take. But as the comedy in 50/50 turns darker, Gordon-Levitt, who's maybe the most natural, least affected actor of his generation, makes prickly plenty engaging.__An everyman tale with plenty of heart and honesty, the serious subject matter is regularly enlivened with jolts of genuine hilarity, some of it in delightfully questionable taste.__What ensues is "Beaches" meets "Pineapple Express." Which, I've got to tell you, is pretty much what living with cancer is like.__It wrings comedy from cancer and surrounds its saintly protagonist with sickly stereotypes. But the closer it gets to the mortal abyss, the more it feels real and revealing.__Director Jonathan Levine has the ideal approach to the material, which is to stand aside, frame each scene honestly and let the actors drive the story.__The truly outrageous idea, that you can use being gravely ill to get sympathy hookups for yourself and your friends - as underlined in the movie's original, better title, "I'm With Cancer" - is given short shrift.__It succeeds mostly thanks to stellar work by the wonderful Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who capably handles the dramatic heavy lifting, and Seth Rogen, who delivers big laughs as his raunchy bud.__"50/50" takes the hackneyed convention of illness-driven melodrama and reinvigorates it with honesty, clear-eyed compassion and unsentimental wit.__"50/50" is a low-key, authentic, warm-hearted film; the cast is one of the best of the year.__50/50 nimbly draws humor out of a young man's illness, walks a tightrope of tragicomedy and touches on all the right points.__"50/50" will be liked and appreciated even by people who can't imagine wanting to see it.__I admire the audacity of the script, which was written by Will Reiser from personal experience, and I laughed in most of the right places, as people in Adam's life struggle, often absurdly, to say or do the right thing.__Emotionally honest even when it's going for big laughs and filled with lived-in visual detail, it's raunchy and touching without ever being crude or mawkish, a small, sharp comic jewel with a big heart.__Neither the actor nor the filmmakers can get under Adam's skin, despite all the close-ups and the moodily shot scenes filled with the kind of movie silence that feels more like the groping of an uncertain screenwriter than of a man facing his mortality.
__It takes a certain touch to pull it off, and here, the serviceable cast just doesn't have it in them.__The many topics raised - gangs, drugs, immigration, absentee parents, poverty - are examined with didacticism and platitudes instead of by mining their inherent complexities.__Overplotted and understructured, "Courageous" is a slog to get through at 130 minutes.__Devolves into over-the-top drama and a suffocating heavy-handedness.__Fails to answer the more pressing question of why religious sagas such as this treat subtlety as a sin.__Courageous literally preaches to the converted, delivering ham-fisted messages of responsibility to the most receptive audience possible.__The performances are effective all around with director Kendrick quite moving in the central role of Adam, the veteran officer, who suffers a horrific family tragedy that sets much of the film's plot in motion.__Like a pastor so caught up in the moment that he can't see that the air conditioning has given out and the congregation wants to go home, the film travels far beyond its dramatic climax, aiming for an altar call finale.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This is a dreary metaphysical drama dressed in the vestments of a religious horror movie.__Oooh. Scary.__The Rite goes wrong in every way.__Starts glumly before flipping into supernatural camp.__Despite an impressive cast (excluding the excruciatingly dull O'Donoghue, a newcomer from Ireland), "The Rite" is the sort of misfire that Hollywood has long buried in January.__A run-of-the-mill chiller that spends an inordinate amount of time flirting with unconventional scare tactics before sacrificing all of its ingenuity to become the latest in a long line of "The Exorcist" clones.__The Rite is all windup, weak delivery.__There may be redemption in store for some of his characters, but Hafstrom has some serious work ahead of him if he wants any kind of absolution after this wreck.__Is it the devil's work or a psychiatric disorder? That is the spurious debate that sputters along in this dull, pretentiously verbose movie that (need it be said?) enthusiastically takes the devil's side.__There are some interesting ideas and themes in The Rite; unfortunately, an uneven tone and a disappointingly generic climax dilute them.__There's nothing wrong with The Rite that spinning heads and a little pea soup wouldn't cure.__Horror fans may be disappointed by this handsome exorcism drama, which aspires to the serious religious feeling of William Friedkin's The Exorcist but delivers little of its shock or gore.__Sure, there are cliches (why must possessed characters talk like Darth Vader in a bathtub?), but the film avoids the schlockier pitfalls of outright Exorcist wannabes.__This is an exorcism movie that those who actually saw The Exorcist in theaters can get into.__...it fails most crucially in pulling its strings together in a way that's not nearly as impressive as it's straining to be.__Dave Whitehead's sound design fills the production with ominous whooshings that sometimes overwhelm the dialogue, not that the dialogue doesn't deserve it.__If it's a nonsensical patchwork quilt, it's mostly a watchable one, with supporting performances from Ciaran Hinds and Rutger Hauer (which is a lot of long, gloomy faces for one movie).__A horror film that goes nowhere very, very slowly.__Perhaps one day, someone will adapt "The Rite" for two actors on stage, minus token effects, and really dig into the dynamics between its two leads. That would be something to see.__As Hopkins himself goes wild-eyed and FX-ed with popping veins, The Rite gives up on asking us to take it seriously.
A pitiable remake of the sloshed "classic" from 1981.__A blander, more responsible 'Arthur' with far fewer laughs and, be warned, a painful update on the classic Burt Bacharach title tune over the end credits.__Russell Brand gives a career-killing performance.__It's amazing how a lifeless, pointless remake can provoke pangs of nostalgia about a mediocre movie. Such is the case with Arthur.__[An] innocuous, blandly therapeutic remake of a comedy that wasn't exactly edgy to begin with.__I don't buy the notion that this is all a lavish fantasy to cheer us in troubled times. It's too clueless and condescending for that.__Arthur may not be much of a movie but Russell Brand is one heck of an Arthur.__It's a sardonic screenplay filled with juvenile characters, and the whole thing doesn't mesh.__Apparently, somebody thought it was time for a remake. Clearly, somebody was dead wrong.__It would be impossible to top the original "Arthur" but this modern version is a consistently funny and sweet if not overly inspired remake.__If you get caught between the moon and New York City -- or even just between two movies at the multiplex -- the best that you can do is skip this one.__This "Arthur" is missing a soul.__Was the lovable lush ever funny? I mean, honestly?__Russell Brand takes on a thankless task and earns at least some thanks.__Attempting to fill Dudley Moore's top hat in "Arthur," Russell Brand rapidly descends the rungs of the comedy ladder from "unfunny" to "irritating" to "vulgar" to the bottom one - "Andy Dick."__With a handful of solid laughs and a modicum of snappy dialogue, it's liable to amuse, if not overwhelm, an audience seeking casual, forgettable entertainment.__"Arthur" might be the year's first summer movie, in the sense that if you're stuck in the house on a rainy day with a large group that extends from tweens to grandparents, you could definitely do worse.__The very idea of this movie suffers from a form of myopia that simply can't be overcome. And, of course, all would be forgiven, if only the thing were funny.__Paper and possibilities do not a movie make. I'm guessing even Christopher Cross is cross.__The problems of "Arthur" are mostly ones of scale. The set pieces are too big, and the movie becomes too labored.
In the end, the movie is about healing and coming to understand that some things can't be explained.__Less a film about communication, in the end, than one with its fingers in its ears.__"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" is the kind of movie you want to punch in the nose.__If imagining a city where people open their doors (or don't) to a boy with a key and a ton of questions is sentimental ... then it is vitally, beautifully so.__Stephen Daldry's extremely labored and incredibly crass adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.__The difficulty is mainly with the story, which despite all the emotion hovering around it, remains thin and uninvolving.__[It] gets far too cute.__It's a genuinely moving and often lovely piece of work - beautifully acted and, ultimately, earning its tears.__The movie forgoes Foer's ambitious tweeness and presents Oskar's outbursts and moodiness - that precociousness - as a disorder.__Not for moviegoers who hold that heartstring-plucking is a betrayal of the contract between director and audience.__Innocent Oskar and his isn't-life-wondrous adventures left me disappointed, depressed and somewhat irritated.__"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" is supposed to promote healing, but as they say in New York: close, but no cigar.__Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock ... Max von Sydow, Zoe Caldwell, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman... thanks for your honest efforts in the service of a fundamentally dishonest weepie.__No movie has ever been able to provide a catharsis for the Holocaust, and I suspect none will ever be able to provide one for 9/11.__You need lots of gifted people chasing after the same bad idea to make a movie as colossally misguided as this one.__Luckily, Horn is so good -- as is Max von Sydow, in a wordless role -- that the film resonates in spite of the tear-jerking strings Daldry pulls.__Sorry, but there must be richer ways of dramatizing so obvious a theme.__With one exception, the quest is lumbering at best, and precious the rest of the time.__Horn delivers a star turn as Oskar, a child trying to make sense of a tragedy that still baffles us all.__Daldry and his screenwriter Eric Roth make the mistake of showing bodies falling from the Twin Towers - it's a mistake because its graphic power seems more exploitative than cathartic - but they otherwise thankfully refrain from pulling out all the stops.
'The Debt' tackles themes of humanity, revenge and truth so successfully it's hard not to find it powerful - even if it's not the Oscar bait it might have hoped to be.__After a gripping first half, turns into one howler after another. And yet it's still gripping.__There is an awkward, irresoluble tension between the movie's urge to thrill and the weighty pull of the historical obligations that it seeks to assume. How much, to be blunt, should we be enjoying ourselves?__Vogel's introduction, 'This is my hand, and this is the speculum,' may at last have displaced the 'Is it safe?' of Christian Szell--another Mengele stand-in--as the most discomfiting sentence ever uttered by doctor to patient onscreen.__Worthington shows a greater range and vulnerability here than he did in either Avatar or Clash of the Titans, where he mostly just flexed his pecs. He may be a genuine movie star yet.__Rather than focus on the evil of the Nazi villain, it wallows in the collective regret of three Israeli Mossad agents who in 1966 let the bad guy slip away when they had him in their clutches.__There are movies you want to like that just won't let you.__The direction and performances remain as solid as ever, but they're both growing obscured by the top-heavy plot.__The Debt has the overall air of an Oscar contender that never got into the ring -- well-made, but not spectacular. Still, it serves as a fine, full introduction to Chastain's potential.__The Debt roots itself in reality more plausibly than most contemporary spy films without sacrificing the genre's tense thrills.__The movie drowns the deeper questions it raises in a sadistic procedural, an endless circular motion of fight scenes whose only justification is themselves.__A strong cast fails to rescue this ponderous Oscar bait.__The thrills work out better than the smarts.__Helen Mirren pulls off the impressive trick of dominating the movie even while she's absent for huge chunks of its running time.__Awkwardly marrying "Munich"-style moral conundrums with cheesy Robert Ludlum stylings, the slow-paced thriller "The Debt" never pays off.__Madden's version maintains all the literal and figurative scars left on these characters, but everything here is made at least one degree more obvious, even as the screenplay tries mightily to hide its secrets.__A Nazi-hunting thriller deepens into a meditation on conscience in The Debt, a movie that holds you in its grip.__The Debt poses an arresting question: In a place that's as haunted by history as Israel is, can a lie ever really serve to prop up a larger truth?__The cast does what it can in the service of this assignment. But some jobs simply resist satisfying completion.__It's a wakeup face slap for a medium that has spent too many warm-weather nights dreaming of superheroes and frat boys.
A noisy, unfocused, frequently annoying and intermittently offensive slapstick misfire.__It does not care for your soft comedy.__The Sitter wants to have its urinal cake and eat it too, pushing the envelope of taste one minute and then delivering maudlin little life lessons the next.__For every laugh offered by The Sitter, there are five minutes of boredom and at least one failed scene of would-be "dramatic" character building.__The Sitter seems to have a good heart, so why all the glib racism?__Hill plays Noah with just the right amount of self-loathing, deep down convinced of his own merit, not needing to humiliate anyone to prove it.__A weirdly charming comedy that puts an irresponsible guy in charge of three unhappy kids. Who'll crumble first?__If you can get past that rude-awakening opening - and some of the rougher humor - there's a comedy here. And probably the last halfway acceptable one of the year.__Somehow, even in this foul climate, Hill manages to stay likeable, although the strain definitely shows. The same cannot be said of director David Gordon Green.__[Its] most valuable contribution to the cinematic landscape is its blessedly brief 80-minute running time.__It's smart, funny, agreeably perverse and simultaneously abrupt and exhausting.__[A] terribly unfunny and overwhelmingly raunchy film that stars the normally likable, or at least comically forgivable, Jonah Hill. He is neither here.__Jonah Hill bites off more than he can chew in this '80s up-all-night comedy.__This is a warped, terribly misguided and often incredibly tasteless film.__None of the story's squishiness come as a real surprise, though the thinness of the material and Mr. Green's apparent willingness to settle for so little do.__[A] well-intentioned mess of a comedy so desperate for laughs it crams a half-dozen story arcs into the plot without telling one of them well.__Sit this one out.__As with many R-rated studio comedies, the transgressive humor isn't nearly as offensive as the phony sentiment that's supposed to redeem it.__Hill's trademark verbal hyperactivity never truly breaks through a script that's way more complicated than it needs to be.__This ostensibly wild-and-crazy romp plays things too close to the book to feel genuinely wild or crazy.
__Yes, Streep is wondrous as usual, but her superpowers have been squandered here.__The Iron Lady is a performance in search of a film.__Often "The Iron Lady" relies on montages to get to - and plow through - historic high points.__[Streep's] performance overpowers the movie it's in - a perfectly executed triple axel that renders everything else just featureless ice.__Streep's performance is so true and so uncannily accurate, so full and so complete in its understanding, that she is fascinating every second she is onscreen.__Streep, no fan of Thatcher, nicely undercuts the poignancy of her current condition with flashbacks that reveal her brittle arrogance in office.__While the rest of "The Iron Lady" fades quickly in memory, Meryl Streep's performance in the title role remains startlingly present.__Everything Streep does here is a seismic act of theater. If she so much as tilts her head, the earth tilts with it. She doesn't simply overwhelm this thin historic biography - and the other actors around her - she detonates it.__The portrait that Streep delivers in Phyllida Lloyd's impressionistic biopic is astonishing.__Streep is Oscar-worthy here, as she almost always is, which is hardly a surprise, and the historic subject matter is fascinating whichever way your politics may lean.__A stylized biography of one of the most powerful women in politics, portrayed by the greatest actress of our time, that asks more questions than it answers.__Even if you have little interest in Thatcher or why she mattered, you'll likely respond to the contradictory yet charismatic character that Streep has conjured from truth and myth.__Yes, it's a strangely de-politicized portrait of Britain's first female prime minister. But what's there is actually enough.__You have to be very talented to work with Meryl Streep. It also helps to know how to use her. "The Iron Lady" fails in both of these categories.__Streep gets under the skin of one of the 20th century's most dynamic and also most contained personalities.__Streep and Broadbent are entirely watchable, and Thatcher's story, even in its vague and watered-down state, is inherently interesting.__Certainly, it's worth seeing and arguing over, but my personal take on Thatcher remains unchanged, Streep's virtuoso ministrations notwithstanding.__It isn't Streep's fault that The Iron Lady ends up feeling so uninvolving and oddly dour.__Maudlin and ham-fisted, The Iron Lady is cinematic scrap metal.
The God of Aborted Franchises will be pleased.__"Priest'' is based on a series of Korean graphic novels. What it's really based on, though, is other movies - a whole lot of other movies.__High production values and slick editing can't save this picture. Nor does its overbearing soundtrack music, which tries to strong-arm viewers into believing they're watching a pulse-pounding thriller.__A mash-up of vampire horror and period westerns stewed with Blade Runner cityscapes and ridiculous religious images in a bubbling cauldron of dumb ideas and sinfully bad dialogue.__Too good-looking to be dismissed entirely, not bad enough to be worthy of outright scorn, but not good enough to watch, either.__The film, based in name only on a series of South Korean graphic novels, has nice, washed-out desert exteriors and some cool jet-powered motorcycles, but there's nothing in the hackneyed story or the derivative action scenes to make you take notice.__The whole thing -- which in less than an hour-and-a-half manages to insult Catholics, Native Americans, John Wayne fans and anybody with two I.Q. points to spare -- all climaxes in a lot of fire and smoke and CGI explosions.__The film is somehow a disappointing combo of too-full and oddly empty.__When you watch Bettany, you can't help wondering why the hell a talented actor is stuck in such an ungodly mess.__[If] you're looking for a diverting sci-fi actioner that handily mixes the DNA of several different movies, with a few flying crosses thrown in and a heavy dose of Western mythology, sink your teeth in.__Adapted from a graphic-novel series (and what isn't these days?), this unholy mess of horror and Western cliches is, at least, blessed with a wonderfully loony premise.__The simplistic directness of its storytelling is refreshing. It's as if the filmmakers realize they're wasting everyone's time, so they at least want to take up as little of it as possible.__Doesn't have a prayer.__Not exactly an unholy mess, but still a rather too pious retread of classic sci-fi/action/horror riffs that lacks originality or pizzazz.__Did Paul Bettany know, when he donned the cowl of the albino monk in 'The Da Vinci Code', that he would soon be typecast as Hollywood's go-to guy for God-bothering multiplex action movies?__None__None__None__None__None
Statham, he of the chiseled physique and sexily receding hairline, holds his own here, doing what he has to in scenes and no more -- which is perfect for a movie like this.__The Mechanic is like a Beretta loaded with blanks -- quick and brutal but ultimately empty.__Clinging to false heroism and terrified of anything too dark, The Mechanic is a tough-guy movie for wimps.__Statham is a model of control; he's steely and graceful in his action scenes, and his interplay with the wiry Foster delivers the goods.__The new stunts are explosive, over-the-top and a sign of the times -- action fans aren't happy these days, it seems, unless at least one scene involves a jackknifing 18-wheeler and a fireball.__Betrayal, sympathy and regret are central to the story, but there's hardly any room for such feelings amid the clockwork carnage.__The interplay between dry Arthur and crazy, caustic Steve is what makes the movie fun.__The Arthur/Steve relationship at the movie's heart is what lifts The Mechanic above the common run of kablammo! action thrillers.__There just isn't enough consistent energy to light up the glum, generic plot or enliven the one-dimensional performances.__Jason Statham needs to get a tune-up, switch gears and hit the gas.__The result is just good enough to pass as an action flick you watch with the forgiving gaze that comes from too many beers and too little sleep.__Even by the sloppy, soulless standards of hit man movies, "The Mechanic" is a mess.__Considerably more fun than the rather lethargic original.__"The Mechanic," 2011 edition, is a striking-looking work, combining an arty inkiness with a retro-graininess that more or less screams 1970s, albeit without the cliches and flatness. If only you liked the people in the picture.__A sputtering remake in need of a more powerful recharge.__To the extent it makes sense, it's a collection of time-honored cliches, and to the extent that it's original, "The Mechanic" is insane, bordering on gloriously insane.__The first legitimate action film of 2011.__Mr. Statham, the specialist in English tough guys who was so affecting in "The Bank Job," has more to offer than "The Mechanic" has the grace to receive.__West's slick, fairly faithful new remake gives partial screenplay credit to Lewis John Carlino, who wrote the original "Mechanic." But the picture isn't likely to do for Jason Statham what the 1972 film did for Bronson.__An intermittently arresting, mostly standard action entry that deals death noisily more than cleverly - a lot like the original.
While the ultra-banal dialogue draws the occasional titter, the action scenes are tame and it's rife with plot holes that you could navigate a burning blimp through.__The movie is a more objective opportunity to assess Lautner's potential as a general-purpose action hero once his emo-goth run wraps. You might not want to go betting on that one.__A blockhead espionage thriller from director-for-hire John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood).__Perhaps the only way to approach Abduction that will not result in a 105-minute boredom-induced coma is to think of it as a comedy, preferably with a drinking game attached.__Singleton once radiated ambition and vision. These days, he seems to be aiming for mediocrity at best. Even by those extraordinarily lenient standards, the inessential, perfunctory Abduction falls short.__Sadly, it's impossible to fake the faintest enthusiasm for this picture, which is a fourth-rate Hollywood thriller that bungles a lot of thievery from better movies.__Whether the fault was haste or cynicism, Abduction feels like a movie designed to ride on the back of Twilight's phenomenal success, with held noses and paycheques all around.__[Lautner's] not a terrible actor, but if he wants a career after the Twilight fades, he'll pick better films.__A ridiculously cheesy confection filled with unthrilling thrills, bored-looking adults and a comically overstuffed backstory.__Twi-Hards shall attend en masse. Adults shall roll their eyes. And on our human comedy shall go.__"Abduction" is just the third movie John Singleton has directed in the past decade, and it contains neither the passion nor the competence of his two previous genre efforts - "2 Fast 2 Furious" and "Four Brothers."__Why, for his first theatrical job in six years, is Singleton - who has a busy producing career on the side - directing this? The film has a decent budget (and hints, desperately, at sequels). But a Taylor Lautner teen-spy movie? Really?__Actual abduction may be preferable to the movie of the same name, but only if your kidnappers don't torture you by forcing you to watch it.__Filled with laughable dialogue, Abduction goes nowhere.__A haggardly slapdash Bourne Identity knockoff, never rising above the level of basic competence.__To give Mr. Lautner his due, he is a martial-arts dervish with perfectly sculptured abs. His acting, however, is another matter.__Taylor Lautner tries to hold his own in an action thriller too silly to give him much of a chance.__It's too early in Lautner's career to judge whether he's going to blossom from box-of-kittens-adorable teen dream to actual actor, but movies as wispy as Abduction aren't going to help him get there.__As an action star, Lautner handles himself reasonably well. He has a bit too much of a boy-band singer look to him, but he's likeable and the major deficiency of "Abduction" isn't his. It's the script.__"Abduction" falls in the same corner of the youth market as the "Twilight" movies. Some moments and many lines feel cribbed from that series.
'Beastly' is a special brand of hogwash: a fairy tale that preaches inner beauty while refusing to obscure the looks of its doomed hero.__In every aspect, from story to tone to characterization to visual aesthetic, it's laughably perfunctory, as though everyone involved were too embarrassed to give it more than a half-ironic token effort.__Beneath it all, however, is a movie with a good heart.__Stunningly bad.__Teens convinced that a pimple will kill their social life will find Beastly bracingly honest. It's the cynicism, not the phoned-in uplift, that works in this JV Grand Guignol.__For a fable about a magical curse, "Beastly" is strangely earthbound. And once it starts, it just seems to go on sappily ever after.__There are flashes of genuine wit and charm that, while they cannot support the rest, hint at what was intended and not realized.__Beastly gets one timeless fact right: For hatchet faces, fatty cakes and Frankenskanks, high school can definitely feel like a curse.__You have to admire the bravery of the filmmakers, who went ahead and made a movie despite not understanding the subject matter. It's also pretty impressive that anyone could miss the point of Beauty and the Beast.__More than lives up to its name with ultra-campy performances, high-glucose direction (Daniel Barnz), laughable dialogue, cheesy effects and a back-lot simulation of a Manhattan street that wouldn't pass muster on an after-school special.__Oh, yes, the script is a little ham-fisted, plowing through exposition and establishing character with a steam shovel, but in a tale like this, sometimes being obvious and cutting to the chase can be a virtue.__[A] tin-eared, corny attempt at fairy-tale interpretation.__A pallid, formulaic teen romance that might have benefited from a little snark.__Beastly is just as superficial and obsessed with looks as the characters and the mindset it rails against, which would seem like a bitter, frustrating irony if it merited the emotional reaction to care that much.__Like Pettyfer, Vanessa Hudgens is blessed with amazing looks to go along with her limited acting.__Roses and love bloom, and you might giggle yourself sick, but this is the kind of cornball entertainment that rainy afternoons were made for. Throw in a cozy sofa too. Beastly will size down well on your television.__It takes guts to transform heartthrob Alex Pettyfer into a disfigured hero for the bulk of Beastly, a contemporary retelling of Beauty and the Beast. It takes even more guts to do it differently than the book's fans might expect.__It's dogged by awkward dialogue, a ridiculous plot and lackluster performances, especially by the leads, Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens.__A sly and pleasant-enough young-adult programmer that is more likeable than not.__An intolerably sappy "Beauty and the Beast" for the Clearasil set.
It's a pleasure to sink into an animated family movie from Disney that radiates charm with a gentleness that seems damn near revolutionary.__Disney doesn't offer much here that it hasn't done as well before.__"Winnie the Pooh" is a very full jar of honey indeed.__This is indeed good old Pooh, nothing to fear. No space robots or serial killers have been added to the cast.__One would have to have a heart of cold temperament to find much -- if anything -- wrong with the animated adventure Winnie the Pooh.__Winnie the Pooh will make big people remember their childhoods. And small people will have fun getting to know all of us in the Hundred Acre Wood.__It's a surprisingly solid, often charming effort.__There's no bells and whistles here, no 3-D or useless grey fluff, just Pooh as he's always been, silly and true.__Clocking in at a zippy 63 minutes, the story is precisely the right length for squirmy tots and concludes before the minimal plot grows stale for adults.__The 1966-1974 "Winnie the Pooh" shorts that used to air on Disney's Sunday night program were thinly plotted, simply drawn and replete with silly songs and jokes for third-graders. Why mess with perfection?__It doesn't matter that the film is just for kids. When it does its job right, everyone watching it is a kid.__The makers of "Winnie the Pooh" had enough material for a good 65 minutes, and so they did something unusual, practically unheard of in modern times. They made a 65-minute movie.__While his movie doesn't stand a chance at the box office, Pooh succeeds by embracing much of what modern films ... have largely forgotten: old-fashioned movie pleasures.__"Winnie the Pooh" may not be a movie that grown-ups seek out on their own, but it may make some of them jealous of the 4-year-olds who are making the noble bear's acquaintance for the first time.__Winnie the Pooh revives the charm of the original Walt Disney franchise by returning to the source -- the A.A. Milne books about Christopher Robin and his stuffed animals as they learn life lessons amidst their adventures.__Proves a fitting tribute to one of the last century's most enduring children's tales.__This sweet, low-key, and utterly lovable movie reminds us that "fun for all ages" isn't just a marketing come-on.__It's classically Disney, as if Walt himself (actually, John Cleese) were reading us a story.__[It] has a visual and emotional artistry that depicts the value of committed friendships, highlighting challenges that may come along. Yet what it expresses most of all is the sheer fun and joy these experiences can bring.__Sweetly, agreeably traditional.
I had a reasonably good time, on the whole...__Jason Statham cements status as top-level action star.__De Niro, in what amounts to an extended cameo, is radically miscast. That's still no excuse for his nonperformance, which is beyond lackluster.__Statham is just good enough to make one wish he'd challenge himself.__Jason Statham is enjoyable enough to watch that he can occasionally make one forget just how silly and dull a movie like Killer Elite really is.__The movie's not stupid. And that makes it more than bearable and often a little fun.__To be sure, first-time director Gary McKendry keeps things moving at an adrenalized pace, even through thickets of flashbacks. But this is precisely Killer Elite's major problem: motion at the expense of emotion.__When Robert De Niro, Clive Owen and Jason Statham unite for an action thriller, we should be able to expect something special. Or at least memorable. Instead, "Killer Elite" gives us ordinary.__It doesn't care if you like it, which is why I kind of do.__Simultaneously silly and overwrought...__Clumsily directed by Gary McKendry and poorly written by Matt Sherring, rookies both, the convoluted movie collapses under the weight of its own cliches.__Pure punishment.__[A] pileup of sub-Bourne action set pieces, sad laughs and cliches.__With a B+ cast and a script full of pseudo-profound moral complexities, its aspirations are lofty and its achievements are trifling.__If you want some meaning with your mayhem, or even a good line of dialogue or two, look elsewhere.__Gary McKendry hadn't directed a feature before this one, and you feel it. Any scene that fails to involve the revving of motors or the breaking of bones is dead.__The fun of Killer Elite, such as it is, is all in the hardass action. But there's nothing elite about this disposable time-killer.__It's an analog thriller that benefits from refreshing injections of low-tech adrenaline.__Despite having a perfect cast for a title like Killer Elite, Gary McKendry's feature debut comes across as little more than a generic Jason Statham movie with two high-profile guest stars.__The script is a mess.
After a while, the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money.__Another forgettable trifle from Cage.__Director Dominic Sena sets a quick pace; the dull moments are brightened by the unexpectedly likable team of Cage and Perlman.__Cage is effective as a falling down drunk in Las Vegas or a treasure hunter navigating goofy road trips but not as a disillusioned champion of the Church going one-on-one with a demon. Steven Seagal would have been more believable.__It's Centurion Deux without the second-coming-of-Carpenter pretense, though you still wish the trashiness were more distinctive.__Cage alternates between leaden line readings and thunderous outbursts, making his accomplished costars Ulrich Thomsen and Stephen Campbell Moore look even better. But the movie's worst aspect is the CGI, which packs no scares whatsoever.__Even the most dedicated of Nicolas Cage's fans will find little to enjoy about the historical-fantasy-action romp Season of the Witch.__Another movie is turned into a turkey.__The film is not altogether dreadful, although it's far from good. And that's not good. Classic stinkeroos are rarer than masterpieces, and we all need a laugh now and then, even if the laughs are inadvertent.__Season of the Witch is as bloodless as a starved vampire. Instead of a review, it deserves a stake in the heart.__Audiences considering "Season of the Witch" should heed the timeless advice of its ancestor "Holy Grail" -- run away!__Rather than elevating this wanna-be Hammer horror flick, Cage somehow lowers its quality.__A mishmash of horror and history genres that's not as bad as its trailers but ultimately is dragged down by, of all things, its star.__Really, at its worst, the whole thing's a little bit like "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" - minus the jokes.__Ever since Bergman's "The Virgin Spring" was remade as "Last House on the Left," his work has suggested a rich mine for homage.__It's got videogame-from-hell F/X, plus jousting, plus Cage in tangled long hair he seems to have mistakenly put in the washing machine.__Cage's old pal Dominic Sena is a decade removed from their "Gone in 60 Seconds" directing glory, and he gets nothing out of this script that isn't pure hokum.__A 14th-century road movie with 21st-century cuss words.__A CGI freakout at the finale can't save this mundane medieval thriller about witches, devils and disillusioned knights.__Season of the Witch is a fine example of a film that would've been great fun if only its creators had a sense of humor about the wild brew of absurdity they had percolating.
Rudd brings color and dimension to a borderline-simpleton schlub who could have easily become a one-note cliche.__Strange, then, how Our Idiot Brother wastes its lone asset -- there's not enough idiot, and far too many boring savants.__It's rare that summer ends on as sweet a note as Our Idiot Brother.__The cast members, beginning with Rudd, have an improvisatory ease, and the director, Jesse Peretz, working from a script by Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall, doesn't indulge in the sort of nail-on-the-head comedy that currently reigns.__Even the usually likable Rudd can't do much with the enigmatic Ned, who often behaves exactly in the idiotic manner he's accused of.__Dude, where's the movie?__The film goes far on its good nature, though it is never more than gently funny.__A film that offers dumb fun, but in reality may be crazy like a fox.__Rudd has created a genuinely engaging character in the Candide-like Ned, but "Our Idiot Brother" gives him very little garden to cultivate.__Despite a pleasantly laid-back demeanor, you wish it would just get focused.__It's a warm, intelligent and highly contemporary comedy with just the right amount of edge, a terrific ensemble cast and a big, fuzzy golden retriever ready to knock you down and lick you like a giant lollipop.__Ned turns out to be a strangely moving figure, a comic foil worthy of affection, perhaps even respect.__The laughs are consistent and occasionally outlandish, but more often, they arise out of recognizable family situations.__A thin, unconvincing movie made likable by the charm and skill of its cast and by a script peppered with wit and insight.__Easily could have been mildly funny and phony but instead is really funny and true to life.__Welcome to the world of Ned, an eternally sunny realm where everyone is greeted as an old friend and everything will always work out fine, even when it doesn't.__Our Idiot Brother comes off as a blueprint for a smart script no one really made.__It's mediocre in a passive, energy-sapping way midway between humdrum and ho-hum.__The comedy isn't always as crisp as it should be, but Peretz has the perfect partner in crime in Rudd.__The rhythms are gentle, the smiles plentiful, the chuckles frequent, with the overall effect about as pleasantly innocuous as the film's hero.
A terrific big-screen/3D film about the rescue of baby elephants and orangutans by dedicated humans introduces young people to a strong conservation ethic.__A decent weekend diversion, this IMAX documentary is cute enough to engage your kids, while teaching them the most basic lessons in ecological responsibility.__Their stories are touching and inspiring, but let's face it, the visuals are what make this movie. Born to be Wild takes you to places you've never been and makes you wish you had.__The hip soundtrack adds momentum, and the reassuring narration of Morgan Freeman lets us know these lucky orphans will have a fighting chance for survival after taking their first steps -- or swings -- back into the wild.__Given the sheer scale of the format, Imax provides an ideal context in which to experience 3D, allowing the eyes to wander about each periphery-filling frame and focus on whatever catches our interest, the way we do in the real world.__While there's an important story here - how these two women take in endangered animals with the intention of later releasing them back into the wild - the main attraction is the general adorableness.__It's sort of poetic justice that the wretched "Sucker Punch" is getting kicked off four Manhattan IMAX screens after just two weeks by this charming nature documentary.__"Born to be Wild" is a good nature film - and a great technical achievement.__A moving, engaging and revelatory IMAX attraction with two heroines and a crowd of charming beasts.__Although it runs just a fleet 40 minutes, the film proves a rich and memorable journey.__Wholesome and educational, teaches right from wrong, and brings up some important environmental issues.__Some animal parts, it turns out, are perfectly suited to 3-D, none more so than an elephant's trunk.__An honest marketer might have just gone ahead and titled the film "Awwwww.''__Born to be Wild is both grand spectacle and intimate tale.__Everything a family movie should be: touching, funny and inspiring.__Touching in a zoolike, rather than spectacular, way.__Cute, but never insufferably so, "Born to Be Wild 3D" is best taken as the perfect film to transition your kids from animation to live action fare - short, sweet, and educational.__Clocking in at only 40 minutes, the film has no time to thoroughly explore the issues at the heart of its bifurcated tale.__None__None
There is so much here that one admires, one wishes that there was more to love.__The film looks good, it sounds great (Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' score is full of darkly murmuring woodwinds), and Madison is a pip of a lead.__A welcome alternative to the current genre offerings, steeped in old-fashioned atmosphere and faithful to haunted house routine, albeit to a fault.__This is still a seriously entertaining horror movie, one that will please newcomers as well as fans of the original oddity.__Despite all the care that has been put into it, the film doesn't transcend its dime-store horror roots.__The season's scariest horror film - and, depending on what the next few months bring, perhaps the year's.__"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" will turn your nerve endings to Popsicles.__This artless film even approaches child abuse, in the way it crassly reconfigures the protagonist from the besieged adult woman of the original into a neglected and terrified tot.__Mr. Nixey is doing an Alfred Hitchcock homage within a movie lacking anything as subversive, or skilled, as Hitchcock.__There's no denying that his latest monsters are imaginative and detailed creations, but the haunted house-style story is hampered by his desire to show them off.__What they're after is clear from the film's gruesome prologue; what they look like is withheld until long after we have ceased to care.__Don't worry about fearing darkness, but beware horror flicks that trot out every hoary cliche.__"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark," expands upon the creepy and effective TV movie from 1973.__The film never takes hold emotionally, despite strong work from Holmes and young Madison. With Del Toro's name in the credits, standard chills aren't enough.__If there's one big flaw with Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, it's that in 2011, there's only so long that we can watch movie characters face the perils of a haunted house without thinking, "GET OUT ALREADY!"__As a horror film should be, it's gruesome, tension-filled and you can't tear your eyes from the screen. But it's also cruel, quite depressing and utterly sad.__I do hope that "Don't" doesn't do Nixey in, as he has a real knack for staging high anxiety. For Del Toro, the question is, what happened?__While there are moments of eldritch atmosphere and a few pro forma jolts, nothing here justifies our attention, let alone the film's inexplicable R rating.__Joltingly graphic and atmospheric (Nixey and his crew at least know how to set up a few good shocks), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark fails to involve us in any meaningful way with its characters.__If you flinch at "boo," you'll find plenty to jump at here. Just don't expect striking originality, or even genuinely memorable eeriness.
Its downfall is its cliche-riddled and fusty script.__Despite the millions clearly poured into it, the film feels cheap and amateurish. See it on IMAX if you wish, but the flaws will only look bigger.__Sometimes the sets look like, well, Styrofoam. So do the actors.__Stick that camera down an aquatic cave, wrap a paper-thin plot around it, slap the whole thing up on an IMAX screen and call it a movie. More truth in advertising: Call it a lame movie.__After a sluggish half hour, this well-crafted adventure kicks into high gear and never lets up.__There's just water, water everywhere - and no one stops to think.__Released over Super Bowl weekend, it makes perfect sense that Sanctum is horrid. What studio expects anyone to go to the theater on Sunday?__If you're able to think of characters as just air bubbles to get past, then dive in, the excitement's fine.__"Sanctum" is a movie that tries to make you feel that there's this cool thing going on that everybody knows about except you.__"Sanctum" turns out to be as gripping as plankton.__The director Alister Grierson, not grasping that bad dialogue is sometimes best delivered quietly, encourages his actors to shout and thrash about, and so they do, like fish out of water and performers out of their depth.__Forget 127 Hours: "Sanctum" makes sawing off your own arm look like a minor penalty for the crime of spelunking while clueless.__Actually being stuck in a remote waterlogged grotto might be more tolerable than enduring this disaster of an adventure movie.__No film in recent memory has been so strenuously at war with itself, although for me, a self-confessed sucker for the IMAX brand of eye candy, the images narrowly-as well as widely-carry the day.__For much of the film, and despite groan-worthy dialogue that often takes you right out of the picture, you'll likely be holding your breath in genuine suspense.__If not for the by-the-numbers script, a slim collection of underdeveloped characters and generally flat acting, the film could have had a real punch.__With ace underwater photography and scuba-diving stunt doubles, Sanctum doesn't stint on action.__What we get are three-dimensional caves and two-dimensional characters.__The action scenes are sometimes horrifying enough to make you gasp aloud. If only the rest of the film were similarly breathtaking.__While Sanctum is frustratingly familiar, it's easy to get caught up in the action.
Ridiculously contrived, superficial throughout and too sugary, 'Monte Carlo' is still too innocent and convivial to cast too many aspersions on.__Teen girls who want a vicarious overseas jaunt are advised to follow Emma's lead in one scene of Monte Carlo and watch To Catch a Thief instead.__The movie sputs out like fizzled fireworks in the Monte Carlo night.__The scenery is pretty, the actresses work hard and it all goes by fairly quickly, if unmemorably.__Director Thomas Bezucha lingers too long on side plots and doesn't give the film emotional resonance.__After Selena Gomez's auspicious big-screen debut in Ramona and Beezus, Monte Carlo feels like two steps back for the Wizards of Waverly Place star.__The movie hits a surprising range of emotional grace notes, including several moments of genuine regret, and concludes with an understated moral lesson about the value of self-respect over social status,__Even within the manipulative Princess-for-a-Day genre, Disney Channel product Selena Gomez's Monte Carlo is a chintzy knockoff.__Director and co-writer Thomas Bezucha shows no particular flair for either of his jobs. But kids are unlikely to focus on the terrible editing, flat visuals, or lack of character development.__Despite its soul-searching pretensions, the movie hinges on what is essentially a con -- one bereft of tension and so sanitized for young female viewers that little room is left for temptation or humour or good old-fashioned summer shenanigans.__The movie could have benefitted from shaving about 20 minutes off. There's no need to prolong the inevitable.__For a movie called "Monte Carlo," this one keeps the stakes pretty low.__It provides young girls with some harmless wish-fulfillment without talking down to them, an increasingly rare quality in movies aimed at young people.__Monte Carlo is all about deja vu, cobbling together elements from so many other sources it feels like movie stew.__A frothy, innocuous smorgasbord of girlhood wish fulfillment that scores a direct hit with its target demo.__A less-than-bubbly teen comic romp aimed at little princesses.__It's unpleasant where it should be pleasant, convoluted where it should be streamlined, anxiety provoking where it should be easy, and long, long, long - at least 20 minutes longer than it has a right to be.__It's all very silly and contrived, but it's also airy and agreeably laid-back, not unlike a decent vacation.__Disguises, deceptions -- you could call the narrative of "Monte Carlo" Shakespearean, but I prefer to consider Shakespeare's romantic comedies as "Selena Gomez-esque."__None of this makes much sense - except for the clear message that Europe is more fun if you're rich - but it doesn't really need to.
Dudes, we get it.__With McBride and Franco trying on knowingly bad Brit accents and the entire cast clearly having a whale of a time, the impression is of the world's daftest, priciest, least self-serious end-of-the-pier panto.__Sword and sorcery movies often resemble parodies of themselves even when they are intended to be taken seriously. And then there are genre spoofs like Your Highness that are meant to be funny and leave you stone-faced.__This film looks like it was a lot more fun to make than it is to watch.__None of this is very funny, and most of it is pretty ugly - the last half-hour or so is a paroxysm of bad special effects, amputated limbs and a severed sexual organ.__Basically, the script, from the title on down, feels like something sketched out on rolling papers.__Lots of balls. Also lots of penis jokes. But too loud and obvious.__While the chemistry between characters is impressive and the comic delivery spot-on, the jokes feel unoriginal.__The screenplay by Danny McBride is so hopeless, he didn't even write himself a good role, and he plays the lead.__When somebody says, "The quest sucks," I was inclined to agree.__[Green] has an easy touch when it comes to comedy, which means you can almost sense those moments when the actors give themselves over to the silliness.__This movie is so sophomoric, it makes Pineapple Express, and even Harold and Kumar, look like sophisticated wit.__Considering the talent involved on both sides of the camera, audiences may be expecting more - a lot more.__The chief problem with Your Highness is its lack of imagination -- its misuse and overuse of language and visual riffs that are only marginally amusing at best.__By and large, "Your Highness" is a Cheech and Chong movie in period drag, so it's no wonder it goes up in smoke.__The whole thing plays like one of those supposedly hilarious ideas hatched on a late night - though generally, in the light of day, such ideas are quickly abandoned.__It is a pox on comedy.__An inventory of the preoccupations of 13-year-old boys.__A radioactive turd disguised as a sword-and-sorcery comedy.__There's nothing inherently wrong with prizing entertainment over art, but what happens when the big, dumb popcorn fare isn't even fun?
There's literally nothing here that works: the SFX are limp, the acting is dire and director Chris Gorak seems to be fighting a losing battle with the concept of narrative logic.__It's clear from early on that these characters are as indistinct and lazily rendered as the floating blobs chasing them.__Not since Mark Wahlberg trembled in fear beside a menacing houseplant in The Happening has a film tried to provoke terror with such an unlikely object of menace.__If these dimwits represent the hope of humanity, bring on the alien overlords.__"Darkest Hour'' doesn't have even as much character as those Discover commercials.__What's the point of going all the way to Moscow if the shots you come back with end up looking like cheap green-screen process work?__Really, how slovenly is it to use invisible aliens? If you're going to tease us with nothing but pinwheels of light for three-quarters of the film, you'd better have one heck of a reveal up your sleeve.__An alien invasion flick that evidently expects dramatic shots of a depopulated Red Square to make up for a flatlining screenplay and the absence of even a single compelling character.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The 'Polar Express'-style CG-meets-live-action visuals are creepy and flat, the characters are largely nonexistent and the story takes so many short cuts that it becomes meaningless...__The film looks neither fully real nor fully imagined, which could be forgiven if Mars Needs Moms had something more to offer besides its nifty technology.__They took a small story, made it complicated and burdensome, filmed some actors performing it, turned those actors into affectless, mechanical cartoons, converted it to 3-D, and dropped it in theaters. Wheeee!__So, okay, men are completely irresponsible slobs, which is why women need to be unceasing nags. Check. Great message for the kids.__This is just a big rollercoaster of a movie, filled with dazzling effects and funny creatures and the requisite five-hankie "I love you, Mom" ending. But then, there are some weird gender political battles at play here.__Even though Mars Needs Moms isn't female-friendly, mothers looking for quality time with 6- to 12-year-old boys could do worse than book group passage there soon.__It seems that it's time to admit that dressing actors in LED-studded catsuits, asking them to give performances on sterile white sets and handing the results to a team of computer animators is not a way to make a good movie.__If Breathed's style could have been applied to the animation, this offbeat story would have a better chance at success. Instead, we're left with a kids' movie that leaves audiences cold.__Aside from a relatively brief appearance by Joan Cusack's avatar as the kidnapped mother, there are no involving characters or situations.__While Wells's ice-blue color scheme borrows from both "Tron" films and a litany of "Star Trek" episodes, a majestic musical score by the great composer John Powell somehow makes everything old feel fresh and wondrous again.__Talk about setting the bar too low, especially in a movie that kids will be watching.__The movie is hampered by uninteresting characters, a predictable story and 3-D technology, which darkens even the brightest colors and detracts from the vibrancy of the tale.__Families may be pleasantly surprised to find this an often thrilling and imaginative ride for younger kids with a big helping of heart for parents.__Mars may need moms, but Earth needs good movies, and this isn't one of them.__Instead of breathing life into cartoonist Berkeley Breathed's cheeky kids morality tale, the movie - with all its 3-D motion capture animation flash - flatlines.__Mars Needs Moms isn't much of a movie, but it's a great teaching tool for how not to make an animated film.__"Mars Needs Moms" doesn't crash-land into "Yogi Bear" territory, but it definitely doesn't soar to "Toy Story 3" heights of animated grandeur.__"Mars'' needs Mom more than the filmmakers seem to realize.__An entertaining, accomplished movie that shows off what its signature technology can do...__Mars Needs Moms is precisely the sort of mess that just grows more depressing the more one ruminates on it.
A well-acted but ramshackle mess.____Was the screenplay, credited to David Loucka, this schizophrenic from the beginning? Or was some major tampering/reworking done at some point?__The film's ambitions are woefully small and familiar.__This suburban gothic is a logy, convoluted mess.__While Will and Libby struggle to adjust their thinking caps, the viewer already knows, thanks to the tell-all trailer, the reason for much of the confusion.__This crackpot thriller from the usually competent Jim Sheridan leaves only one mystery unsolved: what on earth was he thinking?__Daniel Craig does everything to dispel comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining with a finely tuned performance, but the film flattens as it tries to explain his character's psychological state.__Sheridan's pacing is turgid and mournful, which lends the story -- sort of like The Shining crossed with Gothika during a sleepover stop at The Amityville Horror -- an air of ponderousness.__Sheridan can't ever quite get hold of the tone and falls back on a default dreaminess (the little girls play a shaky rendition of Beethoven's "Fur Elise" more than once) that never quite convinces.__Despite the talent involved, this is more a snooze than a dream.__There are probably some fascinating behind-the-scenes stories that would explain why Dream House is such a ruined pile of nonsense.__The only thing it haunts you with is: What the heck happened to Jim Sheridan?__Sheridan's tale soon segues into an unevenly paced whodunit pockmarked with lame CG nightmare sequences and populated by hollow ciphers whose every word and action is less believable than the last.__The premise and the execution hold a lot of promise, but the film's climactic reveal will be incredibly obvious to anyone paying even the slightest amount of attention.__None__None__None__None__None
Rent the original instead.__The 2011 version of Conan the Barbarian looks cheap and feels rushed. The few good elements are dwarfed by a generic, nonsensical plot and shoddy storytelling.__Shoddy acting, no real plot, and silly dialogue? You betcha!__Does it satisfy, this tale? In its own modest way, it does.____It ain't a pretty sight -- in fact, it's downright barbaric.__It's just another ham-handed adventure flick in eye-deadening, wallet-draining 3-D.__Momoa ... speaks in one of those trying-too-hard baritones heard in young jocks whose greatest fear is being called gay.__The very definition of the dumb summer flick, designed to squeeze a few last bucks out of the kids before school starts up again.__You can't underestimate the vitality of a movie where manly men give orders such as, "We will cast our rivals into oceans of blood."__Conan the Barbarian lives by a pretty simple ethos: He lives, he loves, he slays. What he doesn't do, alas, is act.__Take a bad movie in two dimensions, film it in three, and what do you get? Three entire dimensions of lousy.__There are swords and sorcery, pirates and monsters, taxed bodices and taxing mythology. In other words, there's the bare minimum necessary to summon this dismal movie into existence.__Dull and uninvolving, Conan the Barbarian occasionally verges on escaping its rut, but never makes good on the promise. It's busy without having energy, a loud, lackluster mess.__It's kind of a wicked blast to watch, especially if you're in the mood for some righteous revenge.__Mr. Momoa has some awfully big biceps to fill. He rises to that task with a pumped physique made for ogling.__Even the Schwarzenegger version had a crackpot long-range vision. This Conan is just a barbarian for hire.__A gaudily ornamented medieval banquet table groaning with junk food and open entrails.__This Conan barely qualifies as a character, smirking and hacking his way through life, never evolving into someone who can change or whom you want to follow.__Pity the fool who tries to reprise the role that made Arnold Schwarzegger an icon.
____Even the most liberal viewer is likely to echo Milady's thoughts of D'Artagnan: "You are very amiable, no doubt, but you would be charming if you would only depart."__Call it the Robert Downey Jr. Meets Sherlock Holmes Effect. A classic popular adventure gets overblown, juiced-up, and generally CGI-ified.__This version of the Musketeers story can't decide if it wants to be an old-fashioned tale of swashbuckling adventure and palace intrigue or a cheeky, effects-heavy rethink of some iconic characters a la the Guy Ritchie-directed Sherlock Holmes.__In the worst possible case, this could go on and on, but please, let's hope it doesn't.__Every time you think it can't get any stupider, it gets right up in your face, calls you "bro," and gets stupider.__Jovovich tries hard to be terribly, terribly wicked, but her performance finds a hitherto unknown middle ground between Divine in Pink Flamingos and Halle Berry in Catwoman that's just embarrassing.__All the borderline pantomime acting and wigged buffoonery is deliberate and silly, but The Three Musketeers remains charmless, a romp brought down by its lead-footed script.__This one is overblown, over-dressed, and grandiosely dopey, packed with gargantuan sets and ludicrous action scenes and shot in unusually dark and dingy 3-D.__Seriously: What the hell?__The very existence of this film illustrates barrel-scraping desperation of the Hollywood kind.__For the latest update of Alexandre Dumas's novel, Paul W.S. Anderson has added flying battleships and elaborate diamond heists.__One for all and all for nowt.__3D swashbuckler wields a disappointingly blunt sword.__A very 2011 take on Alexandre Dumas' classic that feels weirdly dated already.__None__None__None__None
Best of all is Anthony Dod Mantle's breathtaking photography: the Scottish Highlands have never looked so eerily, threateningly beautiful.__The story sags in the middle, as our wanderers traipse through the highlands-not a happy environment for Tatum, who, before his journey even begins, looks all at sea in this distant age.__Wild-eyed, long-haired Brits leap atop the Romans' shields as the soldiers blindly hack away, the bodies so close that you can barely tell the victor from the vanquished. The battles in the fog and rain have a hallucinatory power.__However you slice it, The Eagle is hokum, but modern-day Scots may get a kick out of the film's depiction of their ancestors as mud-caked hellions. Modern-day Romans will have to settle for less.__The latest sandals-and-swords outing, "The Eagle" has landed . . . with a thud.__There's a predictable arc, as the two enemies have to overcome their mutual mistrust to survive.__It's even less interesting than "Centurion."__It's hard to go along for the ride when the characters act more like statuary than people.__A long slog through ancient muck, so-so sword fights and dumb luck.__Alas, from its scruffy period melodrama to its repetitious battles and endless cross-country shots, this film is all grandiosity with no real heft.__Becomes absurd precisely when Channing Tatum marches onto the scene as a Roman army commander.__The Eagle makes for an okay parent-and-young-son film outing. But you'll want to get your youngster the Sutcliff paperback.__Less epic than Gladiator, less ridiculous than last year's Centurion, less homoerotic than Top Gun (but just barely), this is perfectly acceptable matinee fodder.__Despite some breathtaking scenery and documentary-like realism, The Eagle ultimately falls to some surprising contrivances that seem written by focus groups.__A muscularly entertaining adventure inspired by Rosemary Sutcliff's historical fiction The Eagle of the Ninth, hugely popular in middle schools in the mid-20th century.__Exciting and even moving, this robust epic is filled with action, male bonding, and a terrifying sense of wilderness.__Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is kinetic when it needs to be, ruminative and pretty when it doesn't. It looks good.__If this episodic quest still manages to feel too flat and mild, at least it gives us the mysterious Highlands and the Celtic dirge of Atli Orvarsson's outstanding score.__Lumbering along for a bit less than two hours, which passes like three, it feels more like a chore than like an adventure.__Channing Tatum plays Marcus Aquila with an earnest furrowed brow that could indicate gravitas or constipation.
__Shark Night, handled with impersonality by Snakes on a Plane pilot David R. Ellis, aspires to nothing more or less than carrying along an audience through a string of unremarkable kills, often involving high-jumping fish.__A second round is out of the question. Unless, of course, they called it "Gladys Knight 3D.'' Then all is forgiven.__The sharks are rubber and the performances are wooden and that's just about all you need to know.__The result is a movie that isn't crummy, exactly, just blah: when the freakiest teeth on screen belong not to one of Walt Conti's animatronically realized sharks but to a good-ol'-boy called Red, you know you have a problem.__Sharks have it bad enough as endangered, misunderstood predators with a terrible public relations image without seeing their serial-killing stardom drowned out by hammy acting and torture-porn villainy.__It doesn't even live up to the minimal promises of the title: There isn't enough shark action, it mostly takes place during the day, and the 3-D only asserts itself in a couple of shots.__A ho-hum series of kills and lulls so predictable that it doesn't even look like much fun for the sharks; when they open wide, they might as well be yawning.__This limp teens-in-peril fright flick doesn't even deserve to swim in the same bloody waters as Piranha 3D; frankly, there were more genuine jolts in Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer.__The one crime a B-movie should never commit is boring its audience. By even these low standards, "Shark Night 3D" is dead in the water.__Director David R. Ellis has delivered a heartless, suspense-free 100 minutes of sharks dining out on kids stuck on an island in a Louisiana lake.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A boring revamp, with dull 3D effects, insipid teenage protagonists and only sporadically scary outbursts of neck-biting, crucifix-wielding and staking through the heart.__Colin Farrell's performance as Jerry is the pulsing, stakeable heart of the movie.__Farrell is all darting eyes, facial ticks and macho confidence. He never goes over the top, he's not a showy actor, but he's clearly relishing his role and eating it up with abandon. He makes this a Night to remember.__A remarkably confident remake that boasts its own pleasures more often than not.__The new Dreamworks/Disney teen horror comedy, Fright Night, falls into the better-than-expected category.__Voila! Black magic.__It improves on the premise it has been handed, producing a modernized version of a decades-old story that's superior to its predecessor in virtually every aspect.__Gillespie just wants to alternately amuse and frighten you and, to a large extent, he succeeds.__Feeble comic one-liners and slow pacing combine for a routine fangfest in this remake of the 1985 film.__Fright has matured nicely over the quarter-century. While remaining sharp-tongued, the film knows its place on the teen landscape.__"Fright Night" isn't quite a classic vampire movie, but it's refreshingly straightforward and self-deprecating.__The old "Fright Night" was both self-aware and effectively scary, and if this one seems to prefer gruesome digital effects to old-fashioned bump-in-the-night spookiness, it still succeeds in keeping the audience both tickled and anxious.__Farrell looks like he's having the time of his 400-year-old life.__Closing in on a two-hour running time, Fright Night can feel eternal.__"Fright Night" is the best thing to happen to horror movies since red food coloring and Karo syrup.__Knowingly blends Eighties cheese with Nineties snark -- a combination that works better than it sounds.__Gillespie's movie is light and enjoyably foul, and part of the pleasure of watching is the evident pleasure everyone involved had in making it.__The new Fright Night is actually an improvement in many ways -- it's good enough, and entertaining enough, and scary enough. It's just that by Labor Day, you'll probably forget you even saw it.__This "Fright Night" is strictly for horror-movie fans; it's never clever enough to move above its essential silliness.__Director Craig Gillespie and writer Marti Noxon locate a fertile vein of goofy-scary fun.
__It's 80 minutes of dead air.__Boredom sets in long before the last muted shriek. And who cares about the astros? We never get to know them anyway.__For most horror fans it will be kind of a snooze.__The source of the creepy events, when it's finally revealed, is profoundly dull, like a forgettable episode of The X-Files or Fringe.__The film takes a startlingly long time to rev up, and even at less than 90 minutes feels thin and at moments like it is playing for time.__Accomplishes something the world wasn't really crying out for: it recreates the tedium of watching the later Apollo missions.__Despite stretches of skillfully sustained suspense, Apollo 18 ultimately comes across as little more than a modestly clever stunt.__Make no mistake, Apollo 18 is a *terrible* movie.__Reconfirms that most entries in the "found-footage" horror subgenre should remain lost.__Apollo 18 fails to stay with you because, like the cratered satellite on which it's set, it has no atmosphere.__This space-set, "found footage" horror flick never lifts off.__Has no thrills, no chills, no scares and contains a villain, or several of them, actually, that will turn you to stone -- from boredom.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Efficient enough for newcomers perhaps, but never that chilling, and the predictably dull CGI underlines how far movie magic has regressed in the past couple of decades.__The line between homage and apery is a fine one, and The Thing teeters on it at times.__"It's big on the grotesquery but short on genuine scares."__It's not rocket science, but The Thing does offer solid cheap thrills for the slick gore crowd, proving once again: Horror doesn't have to be horrible.__John Carpenter should approve of this reasonably respectful and tough-minded prequel to his 1982 The Thing.__It's no great thing, just a better Thing than expected.__It's the horror equivalent of one of those cheap, straight-to-video animated sequels that Disney's always putting out: same title, same story, none of the inspiration.__There is absolutely nothing in this prequel/remake that improves on the first film or negates it in any way.__The geographical isolation still produces shivers, but the repeated motif no longer resonates.__In terms of scares, this old-fashioned "Thing" is better than most new things.__This movie is basically a sno-cone "Alien" or "Predator" and we've seen nearly a dozen of those.__Here's the thing about the new "The Thing." It isn't as satisfying as the old "The Thing." And it's nowhere near as enthralling as the vintage "Thing," which inspired every other "Thing" to follow.__Like its alien star, the new "The Thing" mimics its prey slavishly - yet still can't quite reproduce its spark of life.__Like The Thing itself, the film seeks to ape the form and behavior of something genuine, but you don't need a fancy test to tell that this is a shoddy replica.__Where the earlier film pulsed with precisely calibrated paranoia and distinctly drawn characters, this inarticulate replay unfolds as mechanistically as a video game.__Part horror film, part space thriller and all gore-fest, the movie ends up being a lot like its protagonist: a mess of a monster that stretches itself too thin to scare much.__It's an imperfect facsimile, guilty of borrowing too many ideas from the earlier film, and then executing them with differing results.__One gut-busting death after another, terror giving way to tedium.__A prequel to a remake, the latest Thing may be set in a very cold climate but it's far from chilling.__Dutch director Matthijs van Heijningen and company deliver lean suspense, and they update the Carpenter crew's gnarly alien-shapeshifter effects skillfully enough to remind us why the concept captures geek imaginations.
There has always been something so inward about [Theron;] she can seem detached or deprived. But here it's as if the script and the direction felt bound to heed that loneliness, and let the actress go with her bravery and the depressive sag of her mouth.__There is a raw honesty here rare in movies, and it's very funny too - excruciating at times.__Young Adult may be the year's most engaging feel-bad movie.__There's little about Mavis that makes for feel-good revelry. That's an understatement, perhaps. Yet, Theron's work feels true to Mavis' malaise -- and often, just as sad.__As good as Theron and Oswalt are, and they're very good, Young Adult doesn't give them enough room to breathe.__A low-key, indie-style comedy that plays precariously close to an unfunny sociopathic case study.__Clear-eyed, fearless and ferociously funny, "Young Adult" is mature filmmaking.__There's enough grit in the film's gears to keep the forward motion from ever getting too smooth.__The comedy of discomfort, so long defined by Curb Your Enthusiasm and its ilk, gets a new hue with Young Adult.__Theron is thrillingly nasty as Mavis.__The movie doesn't weigh that much, but it has a kind of point-blank piquancy that has gradually seeped out of American comedies, which now are mostly going for broad, topical gags that rarely venture into the relatable shadows of human behavior.__Reitman makes bold choices with the story. Not all are fun to watch in the moment, but they add up to a satisfying portrait of a woman off the rails, someone we can laugh at even when we're horrified.__It's enjoyable as a character study, of a character most of us wouldn't want to meet.__Every time you're ready to write off Hollywood comedies, along comes a picture like Young Adult to keep hope alive.__It trades in discomfort and unease, not catharsis. That's an achievement worthy of admiration, if you can endure it.__Theron does a fairly convincing job. It's the movie surrounding her that isn't quite so convincing.__In a less acid romp, Mavis would learn life lessons in the final reel, but director Jason Reitman makes it a point not to let her off the hook.__"Young Adult" finally stumbles not because it tries to make us like Mavis, but because everyone else in it seems to, no matter what she does.__It's an imperfect film, to be sure, but the movie's refusal to sacrifice its leading lady on the altar of Here's How to Behave feels downright revolutionary.__Nobody ever said that adolescence was pretty, even if an increasing number of people are experiencing its final pangs on the cusp of middle age.
Hats off to the camera operators who have captured some astonishing wildlife imagery.__Anyone with a fondness for bambinos of any species should melt at the sight of mamas with nuzzling cubs.__Not coincidentally, African Cats opens on Earth Day. Meeting these magnificent fellow creatures might be a fine way to celebrate.__"African Cats" prefers less preaching and more heartstring-tugging. It works, of course, especially if you're trying to raise your own cubs to adulthood.__No doubt, life is tough in the wild but, this being a Disney flick, it's loving too and even comes with a kiddie-friendly narrative that's easy to summarize and hard to dispute.__Kids will love "African Cats," which is full of "aw" moments. Their parents will appreciate that narrator Samuel L. Jackson keeps things from getting too schmaltzy in this true-life depiction of the circle of life.__"African Cats," while often adorable and at times gripping, is more of a TV-ready experience.__The photography is so spectacular that the accompanying Disney-ization of wildlife is forgiven.__A visually and aurally stunning film that brings viewers up close and very personal with several "big cat" families - as well as a dazzling array of other safari-esque species - living in Kenya's sprawling Masai Mara National Reserve.__There are surely eight million stories on the naked plains, but "African Cats" tells one: about lions and cheetahs and - oh, Bambi! - the power of mother love.__It's deeply involving and primally moving.__Under the direction of BBC wildlife documentary alums Keith Scholey and Alastair Fothergill, "Cats'' looks majestic throughout, even if its Big Stories are sometimes forced at the expense of fleeting, fascinating little details.__Imagine ten Shirley Temples singing "Animal Crackers in My Soup" while pawing at rainbow-colored balls of yarn.__It's a solid hour and a half of intense stuff you don't see every day.__Far too often, African Cats feels episodic in its structure. Rather than featuring a driving, compelling narrative, it's: cheetah vs. gazelle. And then: hyena vs. cheetah. And then: lion vs. crocodile. Who will win???__It's not a put-down of the darker and more straightforward "Last Lions" to suggest "Cats" is to "Lions" what poetry is to prose.__If it maintains a superficially manipulative facade, the film remains committed to addressing the harsh realities of existence on the plains.__Astounding wildlife footage is given a kid-friendly narrative hook, but never overly cuddlified, in Keith Scholey's African Cats.__A story-driven wildlife doc where creatures become characters with names so young audiences can appreciate the natural cycles of life -- and death -- in the animal world.__None
______Too bad, then, that there's no real joy in all the physical business filling the screen, not even in Judy's animated daydreams. Bummer.__The best thing about Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer is the engaging performance of red-haired Aussie starlet Beatty, who will play the titular star in Eloise in Paris. We can only hope that film sticks to the book.__Fun must be won, earned, dominated - it is only through competition that we Moodists may demonstrate our true worth to the fearless leader and her spastic cause.__There isn't even, really, any point. There is, however, throw-up, poo, pee and lots of running around and screaming.__With summer comes theaters filled with superheroes, sequels and forgettable family fare. In the last category, we find "Judy Moody."__"Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer" isn't just "Rare!," as its title heroine would say - it's a seriously perfect vacation destination.__"Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer" is sure to appeal to kids of all ages from 6 to 9 who are female and have no taste or sense of humor.__Were parents ever this indulgent? Were guardians ever this permissive? Were childhood summers ever this carefree? No, no and no.__Though the lead actress, newcomer Jordana Beatty, gives a spunky performance as third-grader Judy, her character's borderline bratty charm wears thin fast. Mostly it's undercut by the movie's irritatingly antic slapstick style.__Got a restless preadolescent daughter around the house? An air-conditioned theater and this breathless kaleidoscope of a movie might be the answer.__[A] canned piece of so-called family entertainment, which slathers on the bright colors and peppy eccentricity but fails to capture the books' childlike voice and essential, grumbling charm.__For those sighing about why they don't make more movies like last year's Ramona and Beezus, based on the book series by Beverly Cleary, they just did.__A film that's energetic but not entirely engaging, fun but never truly funny.__A film that little kids might find perfectly acceptable. Little, little, little kids.__Even for sugary neon fluff, it's awfully lightweight.__Some movies make you remember being a child. Some movies treat you like one. "Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer'' does both.__The move is just begging the audience to think of it as cool and falls as flat as hearing your parents sing along to songs you like on the radio.
I believe the heart of the film, and the cleverest stroke of all, is Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark, someone few of us will have heard of.__That's all familiar lore but, to his credit, director Simon Curtis lays out these separate ambitions and conflicting tensions with breezy dispatch in the early frames.__A dubious idea done in by Adrian Hodges's shallow script and Simon Curtis's clumsy direction.__[Williams] floats through the movie, perfectly capturing Monroe's way of rhythmically whispering through a song, looking softly frightened when uncertain, and not strolling so much as delicately oozing across the floor.__Williams is a more three-dimensional Monroe than the love goddess herself. The performance is both an eerie imitation and a touching revelation.__Curtis occasionally takes his characters out of Pinewood, but they're never really set free, either in physical or emotional terms.__Michelle Williams plays Monroe, and she's a wonder.__It's too bad that Williams didn't have a script or director that would have given the film a better chance of attaining greatness.__[Williams] captures not only Monroe's fragility but also the guile and gumption beneath it. What she can't capture, of course, is Monroe's aura, and without it, the performance comes across as something more than mimicry but less than incandescence.__It's an easy emotional rollercoaster to put an audience through, and while Williams nails the breathy voice and flickers of doubt, her work here is never allowed to feel truly effortless.__After My Week, Monroe remains an enigma. And that isn't a failing of Williams' performance but an expression of its nuance.__When Williams turns on her inner Marilyn -- surrounded by, say, the staff of a stately home she's visiting on the sly -- she's a superstar, with a smile that could light up the surrounding county.__Michelle Williams shoulders the daunting task of portraying the screen legend, and though she requires a body double with the appropriate curves, she gives a sweet and nicely vulnerable performance.__Williams's Monroe is more vital than anything else. The actress captures Monroe's range of emotions and personae, her shifts from vulnerability to brashness.__Brilliantly playing doomed '50s sex bomb Marilyn Monroe, Michelle Williams gets under the skin of the troubled yet vulnerable icon in a way no one else ever has.__Look at how Williams goes from unconsciously being Marilyn to consciously "acting" her. Would that the entire movie were as eloquent.__No other actress has quite understood the frustrated, maternal side of Monroe that informed so many of her performances. Or quite recaptured that absolutely luminous quality she had on film.__What matters is the performance by Michelle Williams. She evokes so many Marilyns, public and private, real and make-believe. We didn't know Monroe, but we believe she must have been something like this.__There are any number of more interesting movies that could have been made with this material.__It's pedestrian in most ways, but Williams - with a little help from friends in the lighting, camera, hair and make-up departments - lends it a touch of magic amid the nonsense.
__This desperately seeking-laughs comedy stars Anna Faris, a comedian with a lot of quirk appeal, though little of it is on display.__With her sweet ditz openness, honk of a voice, blonde pixie looks and absolutely fearless comic flair, Anna Faris should be a superstar. But no one's found the right bottle for her elixir.__Lighting, camerawork, and editing are all a slapdash mess, one that further hinders the actors trying their best to get through this failed hookup of a comedy.__What's Your Number unavoidably plays like a mash-up of the recent romantic comedies that it should have beat to market.__For comedy connoisseurs it isn't news that Anna Faris is a largely untapped treasure. The melancholy question that lingers on the way out of the vulgar yet retrograde What's Your Number? is: Whither Anna?__Once again Anna Faris manages to be the best thing in another not very good Anna Faris movie.__There's very little personal dirt in Sarah Palin: You Betcha! that wouldn't be upstaged by Joe McGinniss' recent Palin tell-all.__For all its edge, What's Your Number? is rooted in stale convention, boxed in by unfair societal strictures and holds to the belief that good girls still need the affirmation of a man and marriage to be complete.__You can tell Faris craves laughs, and so it's incredibly easy to root for her.__This comedy is empty.__There's just zilch here to get excited about. It does nothing you haven't seen before.__What's the point of all this?__It's a cynical exercise in marketing, masquerading as a maverick.__Ranks higher in crudity than in the number of laughs generated.__He is borderline evil, and she is a completely helpless, flailing fool, and there's no reason to think they would stay together for a month.__"What's Your Number?" doesn't know when to quit. Once it subsides into squishy wedding pornography, it is all but unendurable.__A not very good romantic comedy made somewhat bearable by Faris.__"What's Your Number?" suffers from an elaborate plot that traps the actors in scenarios that feel like a screenwriter's (or, in this case, a novelist's) invention.__It's that awkward, tedious monster mash of "chick flick'' and romantic comedy - a flatulent issue of Glamour in a Hildy Johnson hat.
The film might make the book look less astute and interesting than it is, but it still has an undeniable emotional wallop by its close.__One Day is just a gimmicky "new" way of doing an old-fashioned love story. But we'll hear much more of Sturgess, Hathaway, and Lone Scherfig.__It's what a Nicholas Sparks movie would be if it were aimed at grown women rather than teenage girls.__The result is a rom-com with ambition, keen to actually develop the characters and to mix a few tears with the laughs. Well, the effort is admirable, the movie not so much.__Miscasting aside, there's simply very little excitement to the film since you can see where it's going -- chances are even just by reading this review -- right from the start.__Director Lone Scherfig, working from Nicholls's screenplay, takes a big step back here from An Education, her last film__Few films "get" the strange, intertwining bonds of affection quite so effortlessly, although the episodic structure keeps the drama from flowing nicely.__Nicholls has proven a faithful shepherd to his fictional creations, who banter and rant at each other with the practiced elan of the aging couple they're clearly meant to be.__As 1992 rolls around, a sense of dread sets in: Are they really going to do every single year?__Long before the credits roll, you may find yourself wishing your life could flash before your eyes, to end the monotony of this relentless turning of calendar pages.__Amid sharp banter, the film poignantly captures how lives meander and take unexpected turns.__There are no sparks whatsoever, and that's always a deal-breaker for me in romantic films.__Perhaps one day, Hathaway and Sturgess will reunite in a more emotionally satisfying romance.__As so often happens with love, what you hope for is not even close to what you get, and in this case we are left with a heartbreaking disappointment of a film.__"One Day" is a beautiful movie, but beautiful in a way that life often is, not movies.__For much of its running time it somehow fails to capture what makes the book work so well.__No popular storyteller ever went broke stoking the undying female fantasy that if a good woman puts her mind to it, a heel can always be brought to heel.__Watchable but not very gripping.__The movie's content and style generate all the synergy of fingernails and blackboard.__The performances are overeager. Particularly distracting is Hathaway's accent, which is less Yorkshire than New York.
This doesn't pack a punch like 'The Fighter' - but it's still a must for grapple fans.__The movie is so skillfully made, and the performances are so convincingly real (Hardy is sensational), that, as it reaches its cathartic, winning finish, it achieves a surprising compassion and honesty.__Warrior ends up feeling a lot bigger than you expect it to.__It's too corny to live. But the picture is a slam dunk. I mean a ground-and-pound double-leg takedown. It's really gripping.__Warrior's three principle characterizations are compelling - Nolte in particular gives a tempered performance as the shambling, sad-eyed wreck of a dad - but not enough to mask the film's lesser elements.__The beats are familiar, the stakes are high, the fights are brutal, and the rewards are just.__O'Connor films the fight scenes, and the fight training scenes leading up to them, with the requisite oomph.__For all the contemporary references, it's essentially a spin on the story of Cain and Abel, which may be the reason it feels timeless.__It's also a fight movie that knows all the fight movie cliches and doesn't shy away from embracing them wholeheartedly. But it hits its marks and hits them well, and feels fresh even as it traffics so deeply in the familiar.__Warrior is a weirdly affecting hybrid, a 100-proof melodrama that's two-thirds Sylvester Stallone and one-third Eugene O'Neill. Think Rocky's Long Day's Journey into Night.__Director Gavin O'Connor comes out swinging in this flawed but fiercely moving family drama...Strong stuff.__While "Warrior" does offer enough jaw-snapping action to sate any 'roid-ragers in the audience, it works on deeper levels as well.__Nolte's performance is masterful, marshalling together pain and regret and a slowly dawning comprehension in a single wince. But all this film has going for it besides him are its incredibly brutal fight scenes.__A cheap exploitation picture wrapped in miles and miles of stale would-be Oscar scenes...__"Warrior" could have used a bit more guts. But it's still a knockout.__This fictional drama about two men struggling with the anger planted in them by their abusive father has moments of power that push through a fake-out script.__Yes, the coincidences are fast and furious, but both Edgerton and Hardy give powerful performances as damaged men.__Hits things so hard, both literally and metaphorically, that it's hard not to feel pummeled yourself by the time it's over.__The plot is Shakespeare meets Balboa.__Choppy editing makes a hash out of the fight scenes, and, by the end, a Neanderthal sensibility asserts itself: A brotherly beating makes the heart grow fonder.
This film's rewards are many, for those with the patience to simply let it float.__In this flawed yet masterful, unforgettable movie, Malick argues that even the tiniest mote can have value. He sees miracles everywhere. You just have to make an effort to see them, too.__Glibly put, this challenging time-skipping rumination is the big screen equivalent of watching that "Tree" grow.__"The Tree of Life" is rooted in human nature but ascends to the infinite mystery. It's a dizzying climb with few footholds for the timid or cynical, but the view from above is heavenly.__The result actually plays like a divine pronouncement, cosmic in scope and oracular in tone, a cinematic sermon on the mount that shows its creator in exquisite form. Exquisite but frustrating.__The vision is dazzling. The portrayal of family life palpable. The ending ... well, let's go back to the vision.__What a transcendent achievement.__[It] not only aspires to change your life - it tries to explain it, from the first cosmic blip to those busy amoebae splitting and multiplying, to jellyfish jellying through the primal seas, to the planets lined up in a row.__Beautiful, baffling, poetic, pretentious, it's one big ball of moviedom.__Striving for no less than the pinnacle of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Tree of Life falls short of masterful but retains a power that far too many motion pictures lack.__A beautiful, messy film: at times lyrical, intimate, and uplifting; at others, vast, inscrutable, and maddening.__Both good and bad, great and fatally flawed, transporting and disappointingly literal.__This movie weighs so much, yet contains so little. It's all vault and little coin.__These audacious sequences can't help but evoke the metaphysical questing of 2001, and in fact The Tree of Life often feels like a religious response to Stanley Kubrick's cold, cerebral view of our place in the universe. Not to be missed.__An audacious visual poet known for gently probing life's big questions, Malick has gone to the source of it all. He's gifted enough to bring out the spiritual dimensions of astrophysics.__"The Tree of Life" is at times trying and perplexing, but it also contains some of the most psychologically insightful and ecstatic filmmaking imaginable.__I've seen it twice now, and though this childhood was not my childhood, and my spiritual yearnings are not Malick's, "The Tree of Life" already has come to mean a great deal to me.__It's a flawed but impressive experiment, the sort of shoot-the-moon gamble that cinema can't do without.__The Tree of Life is astonishing in some spots, almost incoherent in others and if it doesn't frustrate you at least some of the time ... you're not paying attention.__It's a phenomenal artwork but, for all its solar flares, it's cold to the touch.
__It's funny as hell in places and touchingly warm.__Writer/director Robinson is anything but disciplined... and he's more inclined to just turn the camera on and let Depp do his thing. Which Depp does very well, but as talented and watchable as he is, even he can't completely save the picture.__The Rum Diary has no mighty gonzo wind. Even with a push from its Thompson-worshipping star, Johnny Depp, it leaves our freak flag limp.__Maybe Depp just doesn't want to upstage his hero.__The supporting cast of journalistic riffraff is uniformly excellent.__There was a reason "The Rum Diary" didn't find a publisher until a late-in-life Thompson resurgence, and it's clearer still in this adaptation - there's no real drama here.__The Rum Diary is too muted to convey the intensity that propelled Thompson past most of the other magazine feature writers of his boozy era.__The Rum Diary is a woozy mess that should never have made it to theaters. But then, it stars Johnny Depp, so it did.__Depp, while always fun to watch, phoned this one in.__It flirts with becoming a great journalism tale, or at least a whimsical journalism tale, but that vein leads nowhere, too. Nor is it much of anything else, except a disordered ramble through Thompson's creative imagination.__Depp adroitly captures the "gonzo" spirit of the journalist/author/ingester of many substances.__If you'd like to see one version of the story about how the real Thompson became the famous, public Thompson, "The Rum Diary" is a solid and entertaining telling of that tale.__Paul may be played by one of the most charismatic actors alive, but for the most part, he is just another boozy hack.__"The Rum Diary" exudes a cheery, beery sense of warmth and affection.__The juice that powers "The Rum Diary" has very little to do with the title drink, and almost everything to do with Johnny Depp looking happily intoxicated to play a real character again.__We have some fun with it, but you can tell the actors (not to mention the characters) are having a lot more fun than we are.__A mild lark disguised as a wild bender, "The Rum Diary" is also a touching tribute to Thompson himself, who committed suicide in 2005.__In every move, Depp makes you believe this was a passion project for the actor, one he dedicates to Thompson.__At best diverting, at worst drearily conventional, The Rum Diary is pre-gonzo Thompson. But the seeds are there, ready to yield a harvest of fear and loathing.
____Atmospheric, illuminating and affecting, The Conspirator captivates like an untold story -- one that you can't believe you've never heard until now, and won't soon forget.__Once the ideological cat is out of the bag, the drama is degraded to the level of a historical pageant.__Leaves us feeling as empty as a raided tomb.__A bracing courtroom drama whose every scene seems wreathed in mist, dust motes and cigar smoke, the better to suggest a nation befogged by grief.__There's a stiffness that keeps the story from packing a punch. Still, it's handsomely mounted, and at its best moments has the patina of a Masterpiece Theater production.__The nightmare of Lincoln's assassination, and its immediate aftermath, is effectively delivered, and Wright, shrouded in black, her face a mask of indomitable sorrow, gives great gravity to what might otherwise have been a waxworks historical reenactment.__James McAvoy, as the Civil War veteran who defends Surratt, has an avid presence, but the movie is stiff-jointed and dull.__A better history lesson than it is a drama.__Once you accustom yourself to this film's unhurried rhythm and old-fashioned Hollywood stolidity, The Conspirator is not without its pleasures -- chief among them Robin Wright's quietly fierce performance.__The Conspirator fairly drips with nobility, timeliness and class. If only it were a bit more fiery.__The Conspirator is a quality drama with a capital Q. We should expect no less from Robert Redford, who takes seriously (at times, earnestly) the duties of director.__As the film's director, Robert Redford eases with hypnotic skill into this tale of justice in the aftermath of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.__Wright, who has been doing great and largely unrecognized work for years, is terrific as the hard, handsome, difficult defendant, as is James McAvoy as her reluctant defense counsel.__With her hair darkened and severely pulled back, her face a mask of stony implacability, Wright delivers a simple, unshowy performance that never begs for the audience's sympathy.__Working on an obviously limited budget on locations in Savannah, Ga., Redford does a good job of evoking the era with the help of cinematographer Newton Thomas Siegel.__Instead of entertaining us, director Robert Redford offers us a handsome history lesson that's as dry as a hardtack biscuit.__You have to give credit to Redford, Wright and McAvoy, and the other filmmakers. Not many films this smart can be made.__What it most suggests ... is the sort of classroom film that has kept generations of students off the edge of their seats.
Screenwriter Moira Buffini sticks pretty closely to the novel, and director Cary Fukunaga conjures a drab tone that nicely sets off the characters' violent but rigidly controlled passions.__This is no plain Jane.__If the motion-picture industry had existed in 1847, the year Charlotte Bronte's novel appeared, it might have produced an adaptation much like this one.__Somehow Wasikowska makes it all seem much more personal, more real. With her stark, starched dresses and blunt, elastic face, she draws you in, making both Jane's pain and incredible resolve tangible.__An atmospheric, absorbing version of the classic romance between an abandoned, plucky orphan and a wealthy, mysterious older man with a seriously Gothic secret.__There is not a drab image or a middling performance in the piece. The freewheeling adaptation drops needless scenes and spurs the story ahead with galloping momentum.__By opening their movie with the mature Jane, the filmmakers forge an emotional bond between her and the audience.__True aficionados will doubtless wish the film etched every aspect of the Bronte experience but that's a quibble in light of the movie's intoxicating charms. It's impossible not to fall in love with this Jane.__Cary Fukunaga's feverishly soulful remake of the multiply remade Jane Eyre rises to most challenges -- not the least of which is making Mia Wasikowska, a golden child of current cinema, look homely.__While qualifying as the most gorgeously appointed and finely detailed version of the novel so far, still lacks the element of essential fire to make it come fully, even subversively, to life.__Anyone who savours shades of grey will have a feast.__Beauty, along with a sense of mystery, is what audiences expect in a Gothic romance, and Fukunaga delivers with carefully composed shots of austere landscapes and shadowy Victorian opulence.__Careful, respectful and even enjoyable, and yet dry, singularly humorless and played without the lavishness of spirit that makes sense of Gothic melodrama.__Some of us are "Jane Eyre" addicts, and the new movie version directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga gives us just the right fix.__This is one of the better Jane Eyres I've seen onscreen, a conception that forsakes movie-groomed glamour for a plainer, less compromised beauty.__To no one's surprise, the story still works like Gothic gangbusters, thanks in part to reliable back-court support from Judi Dench (as Mrs. Fairfax) and Sally Hawkins (as Jane's venal guardian).__Luminous in The Kids are All Right and Alice in Wonderland, Wasikowska makes drab seem rad in director Cary Fukunaga's insightful rendering of Bronte's gothic love story, a new classic version of this oft-told tale.__Mia Wasikowska, from Australia, is a relative newcomer who must essentially carry "Jane Eyre," and succeeds with restraint, expressing a strong moral compass.__A better barometer for the necessity of Cary Fukunaga's film, however, might be its less-than-literate box office competition. Applying that consideration, maybe we do need this Jane Eyre after all.__It has passion all right -- in the stylistics. Those star-crossed love birds Jane and Rochester are no match for the tracking shots and throbbing violins.
The appeal of Drive Angry is much the same as that of Piranha: a willingness to revel in absurdity to the degree where the exhilaration is infectious.__So awful it's almost great. But no, it's just awful.__Cage passes the torch to the next generation of scene-chewing actors as he's graciously out-Caged by both Burke and shark-eyed William Fichtner as The Accountant__It's actually refreshing that Lussier and Farmer don't belabor the film's internal mythology of satanic cults, hell and the devil's administrative assistants.__Being stoned or otherwise buzzed might help.__Great title -- shame about the movie.__Drive Angry is pure grindhouse, so committed to its own junkiness that it is, in its way, a pleasure to behold.__Another John Milton wrote: "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven." Cage's character would concur, heartily, before reloading.__Even at its most lurid, though, the movie is a little dull. And it only gets less compelling as the backstory fills in.__It's the worst kind of bad: Boring bad.__It must be handed to Nicolas Cage. He continues to boldly go where few actors willingly do: the Dumpster. His career now is almost completely reverse-engineered.__It's hard to care when the CGI is so obvious and Cage's character so clearly invincible.__Makes a loud, incoherent but oddly compelling case for the enhancing effects of stereoscopic projection on certain treasured objects of the cinematic gaze, like classic Detroit muscle cars, women's breasts and Nicolas Cage.__A trio of stridently weird performances -- from Nicolas Cage, William Fichtner, and David Morse -- brighten this otherwise rote actioner.__Cage has forged his own hell, and it's called: the movies he's addicted to making, even when they trash his brand.__Drive Angry is a Steve Vai solo album of a movie, never letting a second pass without asserting its awesomeness, and thus rarely being awesome.__Drive Angry 3-Dis a movie so wantonly ridiculous, so aggressively stupid, it demands you make fun of it.__Sharp 3D lensing and low-octane camp humor help rev up Drive Angry.__There's hellfire and hot rods aplenty here, but a mindless exploitation entry that should have been appallingly awesome instead marshals too little style or intentional humor.__I can't say I enjoyed it. But I can appreciate it. It offends every standard of taste except bad. But it is well made.
__A routine, if rather gruesome thriller with attractive leads ducking in and out of danger.__Lurie, like Peckinpah, is fascinated by the idea that the seemingly mild, non-confrontational pacifist may be the villain in all of this.____Everything here plays out to the same beats and yet ultimately results in conventional revenge-minded catharsis rather than queasy ambivalence.__While Lurie could have gone lighter on the symbolism, he ratchets up the tension with deft intelligence. He's not just making a thriller but a horror film, and we feel his own fear in every scene.__One of those movies that sits in an armchair, smokes a pipe and reflects "seriously" on "the question of violence," but the main reason to see it is for the hilariously nasty uses it devises for a bear trap, nail gun, etc.__Lurie's smart enough to know that we're supposed to be disturbed -- and not titillated -- by the savagery the movie depicts.__For the most part, Lurie's remake serves as a credible update to the original, and the performances from Skarsgard, Marsden and Bosworth are solid.__The new 'Straw Dogs' is one of the more brutal films in recent years.__Lurie informs his movie with plenty of nods to the original and at least manages a story that will have people talking - if not about the nature of human violence, then about the grisly depiction of it.__You can understand Lurie's motivation for remaking Straw Dogs, and applaud the competence of his filmmaking and casting, while at the same time lamenting what has happened to him.__Back in 1971, the Peckinpah film horrified moviegoers with its bloody climax, whereas today people are so vengeful and sadistic that the remake is just another multiplex crowd pleaser.__[It] doesn't bring anything new to the table.__Rod Lurie's bird-brained remake of "Straw Dogs" doesn't work on its own terms, and it can't hold a candle to the unruly, unstable merits of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 original.__The original Straw Dogs, at least to me, isn't close to being one of Peckinpah's masterpieces, but it's a movie that the people who first saw it still remember 40 years later. I doubt that anyone will remember the new one by next month.__As a filmmaker, Mr. Lurie cannot hope to match Peckinpah's lyricism, but he strikes a decent balance of bluntness and subtlety.__Almost succeeds as an object lesson in the difference between being a man and being a macho animal. But it fails as a gripping home-invasion thriller.__There's no matching the sinister village faces in Peckinpah's cast or the psychological acuity of his scene-making, but Lurie shows himself man enough for the material.__Most details are in place, but the technique and inspiration are missing.
The rare, humanist beauty of Win Win is that none of its characters is a caricature, none of its plot twists a blatant play for tears or laughs, none of its appeal based on some mythical lowest common denominator.__What's just delightful about this wittily observed and touchingly truthful affair is the fact it offers consistently sherbety entertainment in the moment but ultimately holds to its purpose of saying something useful and genuine about real lives.__Giamatti excels as the weak-kneed Mike, nicely working his gift for inner conflict and outer bumbling. As his wife, Amy Ryan is a ballast of unflinching moral certitude.__In the end the film stacks up just this side of twee, as the sort of quirky fare that's passably entertaining without ever offering anything real or remarkable.__[McCarthy's] writing reflects a wariness of human nature but he's not cynical; indeed, the story wraps up with a tenderness that feels true but completely without mush.__Win Win is a winner all the way.__Tom McCarthy's third feature proves something incontestable: The writer-director has a way with American characters.__McCarthy's story and direction don't demand that the audience take sides one way or the other with Mike. He and Giamatti trust us to come to our own conclusions.__A comedy that's ultimately more touching than funny and a joy from beginning to end.__The film is a win-win as a quirky indie comedy and an upbeat sports yarn.__Giamatti, rooting down to the soul of this stressed-out, struggling man, delivers a marvel of a performance - all the more so because we forget that he is performing.__A thoughtful and admirably nuanced moral drama.__It's refreshing to see a lawyer unshackled from the usual cinematic stereotypes.__You have a funny situation, and there's some truth in it and unexpected characters, well-acted, and you may not have a great film but you enjoy watching it.__Through three films, writer-director (and occasional actor) Tom McCarthy has navigated a tricky line between winsome and melancholy.__In its charming and self-effacing way, "Win Win'' is the most radical movie yet from writer-director Tom McCarthy, and it may be one of the more daring movies to be recently released in America.__McCarthy builds his narrative with care and without sentiment and it's impossible to not feel for these characters. Who hasn't taken an easier way out rather than the high road at some time in their lives?__There's no great narrative momentum to Win Win, and that's fine, because it's such an enjoyable little slice of life.__A sports movie in which winning is neither everything nor the only thing.__Though Win Win seems overplotted, what finally emerges is an emotionally honest, economically real portrait of a guy who thinks he's got things figured out, until more problems arise.
Occasionally, it's mildly amusing but the conclusions are so soft it hurts.__Except for a couple of nice touches, "Prom" is a remedial class in cliches.__Prom is a good-hearted, perfectly watchable bonbon about adolescents with little on their minds besides who will ask or be asked to the graduation night shindig.__They're a ridiculously cute pair and ridiculously at odds over this whole prom thingy, which is, by its very nature, ridiculous. So the ridiculous quotient is extremely high.__Never have the stakes seemed so low for everyone involved. This is a sterile high school environment, lacking anything nearing controversy.__Less engrossing than a Clearasil commercial and more synthetic than a Rebecca Black video.__This is a Disney flick, complete with an ensemble of Mouseketeers doing their level best to be the Muzak of kids -- any resemblance to an actual teenager is purely accidental.__She's a conformist overachiever, he's a troubled soul; a third-grader could tell that the two will fall hard for each other by the movie's halfway point.__"Prom" is so strenuously inoffensive it makes Disney's "High School Musical" look almost racy by comparison.__A movie that's so anachronistically mushy and awkward, it earns extra credit simply for being so innocent.__Director Joe Nussbaum's movie comes from promising first-time screenwriter Katie Wech. Her work has a nice spirit; "Prom" may be the same old thing, and squeaky-clean to the point of mild-to-moderate aggravation, but it's not pushy.__There are new tweeners every year. To them, the characters and plot devices in this perfectly competent film might well seem fresh.__You certainly don't expect a Disney live-action movie to be ambitious or edgy, but you don't necessarily expect this degree of sloppiness either.__Here's a by-the-playbook movie if ever there was one. The machinations leading up to the big night are hardly worth the fuss: Prom's entertainment quotient comes up deficient.__For its intended audience, it hits just the right note of drama mixed with cuteness.__It's a sweet, generic safe harbor for young kids, parents, and those teenagers who want to hide from the world for a couple of hours.__'Prom,' directed with too bland a TV hand by Joe Nussbaum, evaporates as you watch it, but it does go down easy.__"Prom" is pure bubble gum, from its shiny wrapping to its mushy insides to its fleeting aftertaste. And sometimes, there's nothing wrong with chewing bubble gum.__Even the young and gullible will see every plot development coming long before Prom's characters do.__The pace is brisk, the soundtrack's bouncy, it really is more like a ride than a movie, and as lies about high school go... it goes down quite easily.
____Oh, look, it's rich people in beautifully appointed houses and they're worried that the nanny might not arrive on time for them to make important morning meetings at work. Boo-hoo.__In the chick-flick world, hell is other women, and here specifically it's the stay-at-home wife and mother.__How nice it would have been had McKenna penned a couple of those audience-addressing interludes for Richard or Jack. What would these modern, succesful men tell us of themselves?__I Don't Know How She Does It purports to be about the difficult choices of modern motherhood, but it's too prim and cautious a movie to dip a pedicured toe into the murky waters of real choice.__The main problem is that this Boston-set flick quite unselfconsciously presents itself as if it were a pop-culture first to express ideas about the working-mom balancing act.__A lot more watchable than its awful trailer indicates.__A meager one-joke comedy peopled by stereotypes.__The film is so bad it's hard to imagine anything saving it.__Like its main character, "I Don't Know How She Does It" tries to do everything, but it doesn't quite succeed.__Any working mother is bound to see herself in this. Provided she is also a fictional character on a sitcom, that is.__Though it aims to be a sharply humorous look at the mommy wars, I Don't Know How She Does It has nothing remotely new or comical in its arsenal.__Spiffy-looking, well-intentioned but ultimately witless.__Why was a string of sitcom problems stretched to 91 minutes?__"I Don't Know How She Does It" seems stuck in the past.__What the hell happened to Sarah Jessica Parker?__It's not that I Don't Know How She Does It tells actual lies about working motherhood - many of its observations and jokes are on point - it's just that it omits the edge, the desperation of a woman on the verge.__Leaves you wondering why nobody involved with this film seems to have ever met an actual working mother.__In describing the conflict of a woman who has it all without enjoying it all, Pearson's book had teeth. McKenna's screenplay has only a smile. But is it ever good to laugh.
Atkinson revives the comic secret agent that he first introduced in a series of TV ads in the UK, but this thin script gives him nothing remotely like a rebirth.__Johnny English Reborn is funny enough to make you laugh and plausible enough, in an exploding-umbrella type of way, to make you care.__At gunpoint I might confess to smiling when English pummeled the Queen of England with a tea tray, but the babysitters for the target audience will know that his best bits are burgled from Austin Powers.__It would seem to appeal mostly to hard-core fans of the "Mr. Bean'' star and children who laugh at the sight of men being repeatedly kicked in the groin.__Joke after joke falls painfully flat. Stay home and introduce your kids to Mr. Bean, instead.__The humor isn't as dual-edged as, say, a Pixar comedy. But director Oliver Parker knows his genre well enough to lampoon the mainstays of the spy-flick genre, from impossibly high-tech weapons to foot chases worthy of Olympic medals.__The movie feels about 10 minutes too long. Still the laughs, including the big laughs, keep coming right up to the closing seconds.__After a fast, funny start, the new sequel, "Johnny English Reborn,'' proves to be more of the same.__The movie coasts on the charms of its rubber-faced star and its witty, easygoing set pieces.__All that matters with efforts like this is whether the cookie-cutter plotting serves up enough situations for Atkinson to contort himself into and out of jams.__Atkinson has amassed a loyal following who will no doubt support "English" in theaters. But most will leave disappointed, thinking, "Bean there, done that."__Atkinson gleans a few laughs from the contrast between his lascivious bedroom eyes and spastic physical comedy, but he can only do so much to elevate material this hopelessly mild.__While Atkinson, with his elastic eyebrows and not-quite-in-on-the-joke gaze, is always a pleasure, the movie feels unnecessary; a way to give some work to a handful of actors while waiting for a real movie to come along.__At least he's being honest: Johnny English Reborn makes no attempt to hide Atkinson's shameless thievery, his lack of invention or even his graying hair.__Fans of sophisticated humor may feel empathy with, if not sympathy for, the lead character on those many occasions he is kicked in the nuts.__Johnny English isn't reborn so much as reheated, and his aim hasn't improved after all these years.__[An] enjoyable if somewhat wheezy reprise.__It's very undemanding, though the enthusiastic granny bashing does provide a quantum of solace.__A redundant spy farce sequel that's less of a rebirth than a retread.__None
__Hart is the comic equivalent of a journeyman musician with a lot of clever licks and one good trick. Once you've seen it, you have little appetite for more.__A couple of adornments - one before the concert footage, one after - flesh out this funny, profanity-heavy movie nicely.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Thomas carries the weight of the movie, and her usual sangfroid works against her; when she finally makes contact with the deported couple's grandson, the story crumples into sentimentality__Scott Thomas's portrayal of her character's emotional transition ensures Sarah's Key will keep your heart open.__French director Paquet-Brenner occasionally yields to melodrama, particularly in the final act, but he is resolute about not depicting all of his countrymen as Nazi stooges, since many weren't.__Thomas' performance is one of brilliant restraint and believable naturalism.__It does provide audiences with the satisfaction of seeing and hearing an important truth expressed, and that's better than making you feel good. That's making you feel something.__Luckily, the movie has Scott Thomas. She knows her radiance can't be helped, so she uses it here like a searchlight.__Scott Thomas is tremendous ... the emotional detail of her performance is never less than gripping, even as the film falters.__A compelling, handsomely produced history lesson and personal drama...__Based on a popular novel by Tatiana De Rosnay, Sarah's Key has perhaps a few too many coincidences and complications, but its impact is undeniable. The scars of war never truly heal.__A movingly told tale of tragedy and its consequences, not just for the players in the original tragedy but also for those touched by their actions, in an ever-widening circle of aftershocks.__Fans of the book will be glad to hear that it's a faithful adaptation, if markedly less compelling than de Rosnay's prose.__"Sarah's Key," based on the novel by Tatiana de Rosnay, struggles with a problem it never overcomes: How do you make viewers care about everyday problems when juxtaposed with the horror of the Holocaust?__Excellent performances make the movie effective. Yet the flashbacks have a depth and resonance largely absent from the modern scenes.__When it finds the right room, "Sarah's Key" unlocks a haunting story.__While the flashbacks come to life through small acts of courage and kindness amid epic-scale evil, the frame story is a recurring letdown that feels trivial and contrived.__"Sarah's Key" cuts back and forth between a tragic story involving the Holocaust and an essentially trivial, feel-good story about a modern-day reporter. It's an awkward fit and diminishes the impact of the earlier story.__In an eloquent, moving manner, Sarah's Key argues that we are all products of the past regardless of whether we are aware of it and that understanding our roots, no matter how painful the process, is preferable to remaining oblivious.__This movie of "Sarah's Key" might have been better if it had rewritten the book, and simply focused on the past.__A dramatic tale of survival and horrific memories struggles against distracting melodrama in "Sarah's Key," and unfortunately, melodrama wins.__Clunky, improbable plot developments match equally inept dialogue.
The result is an offence-free, mild entertainment in which everyone from cast to scriptwriter seems to be winging it.__Failing even to attempt genuinely humorous gags or scenarios, and incapable of conveying the thrill of its obsessive pastime or the majesty of the animals themselves, this feel-good male weepie remains comedically and dramatically grounded.__Unfortunately, these comic geniuses are kept caged by the wan script and direction. The best gag in the film is the opening title card; the best joke, a throwaway by a day player.__A very mild movie, but in the nicest sense of the word.__What a waste that three of our finest actors are utilized as glorified bit players in such an instantly disposable comedy.__The Big Year has charms: Not a jawdropping flock of them, but a number of sweet insights and warm laughs just the same.__People watching birds is a nice thing. People watching a movie about people watching birds is sort of a snore.__Its charms are as small as its singing feathered friends, but they're real enough, and gentle enough, to lift it and give it flight.__You doubt that even the people making it enjoyed it. A better title would be "The Big Yawn."__It's nice to watch a comedy that doesn't screech or foul the nest, but "The Big Year" is no big deal.__It's just all, unfortunately, a little stronger on the pretty pictures than it is on interesting characters, or sharp comedy.__"The Big Year" has heart and sweetness to spare - but as any birder will tell you, focus and energy count, too.__This movie stubbornly refuses to take flight, or generate more than a few chuckles.__A genial comedy with more power under its wings than it seems. This one could have flown over the cuckoo's nest, or smacked into a glass pane, but instead lands in the middle of the road where quirky and popular meet.__Bird-watching - or birding, as practitioners prefer to call it - makes for a stupefyingly boring movie.__This gently charming comedy about a trio of birders is based on a winning premise, likable performances and stunning natural vistas.__There is some harmless pleasure to be found when feathers aren't ruffled, when the fowl is not foul.__Like birding itself, "The Big Year" rewards patience. It respects both the integrity and the eccentricity of the avian obsession, and it communicates something of the fascinating abundance and weirdness of the animals themselves.__All of these featherheads - both the avian and human kind - are lovable. Even better, they're funny, in a comedy that doesn't have to swoop to conquer.__With ambitions greater than comedy and results that fall short of character study, The Big Year is neither fish nor fowl.
You cannot watch the film without feeling kinship with the characters and admitting their decency as well as their mistakes.__Dynamically shot and paced like a thriller, the film has the density and moral prickliness of a good novel.__These people seem so real they might live next door. And they probably do.__"A Separation" is a plaintive fable of the human condition that unites us.__Very few movies capture as convincingly as A Separation does the ways in which seemingly honorable decisions can lead to interpersonal conflict -- even disaster.__To say the piercing Iranian film A Separation is about divorce is a bit like saying The Wizard of Oz is about a pair of slippers.__"A Separation" moves beyond one couple's sundering marriage to reveal growing rifts between generations, ideologies, religious mind-sets, genders and classes in contemporary Iran.__Partly a courtroom drama, partly a political satire and partly a twisty thriller that gradually draws you in and becomes more engrossing with each new revelation.__"A Separation" is a great movie, a look inside a world so foreign that it might as well be another planet, yet so universal that its observations are painfully familiar to anyone, anywhere.__Sometimes, in an attempt to do the best we can for the people we love, we end up wreaking irreparable damage.__Asghar Farhadi's emotionally epic movie is not just a masterpiece dramatically, it is a movie dramatically of its moment.__It's small. It's real. And it's deeply moving.__This is a trenchant emotional thriller that you watch in dread, awe, and amazing aggravation.__Some films wear their artistry so lightly they appear simply to be happening, the inner workings of the story guided by an unseen hand.__The film involves its audience in an unusually direct way, because although we can see the logic of everyone's position, our emotions often disagree.__This is primarily a human story about a marriage unraveling, the husband torn between love for his daughter and devotion to his father, the daughter torn between one parent and the other.__It's an indictment of a culture in which religion and tradition poison a legal system. It is an exploration of the power of a lie. It is a mystery and a courtroom drama. Above all, however, it is a tale of love and sacrifice.__Farhadi is less concerned with the bugs and variations in human perception than cracks in the average moral compass, little fault lines that prompt good people to make bad decisions.__In the guise of a whodunit, Farhadi paints a nuanced portrait of Iranian society that, seen through our Western eyes, looks at once utterly alien and strikingly familiar.__Rashomon-like in its perceptual complexities, truth vs. belief, Asghar Farhadi's drama forces us to constantly shift our assessments and allegiances.
It's an amiable but slow slice of nostalgia: think 'Hot Tub Time Machine' meets 'Superbad' - without the big laughs.__This low-powered, amiable, stunningly unimportant movie is essentially one long, noisy party (set in two houses).__"Take Me Home Tonight" is not a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty good. It's just unnecessary.__It's formulaic at best - and even that formula isn't always thought through.__Drinking jokes. Sex jokes. Wild antics. Sincere looks. Nothing goes on here that hasn't gone on -- and gone on better -- in other movies.__A dirge of a comedy...__After the gimmick begins to fade, what remains is less than likable characters inhabiting an all-too-familiar plot.__It tries hard, but it always falls short.__They speak entirely in plot points and punchlines and seem to be motivated only by lust, greed and ego. Well, we all are, but few bring to this motivation so little intelligence and wit.__It pretends to be hungry like the wolf, yet it ends up doing the safety dance.__A reasonably watchable immersion in nostalgia.__very last joke in the movie -- verbal gags, visual gags, musical cues, camera moves -- is crushingly literal.__It, like, totally pains me to say this, but Take Me Home Tonight is a bummer.__[The] trite boy-meets-girl arc (he lies about his job) is occasionally offset by some potent comic misadventures.__Give the genially bawdy '80s nostalgia trip Take Me Home Tonight credit where it's due: It's got the music part down pat__As a raunchy romantic comedy or an homage to the 1980s, Take Me Home Tonight is hardly worth a one-night stand.__'Take Me Home Tonight' has just enough heart and retro party spirit to hold the line before familiarity breeds contempt.__The mystery of Topher Grace's film career, and why it isn't better, continues with "Take Me Home Tonight."__An amiable diversion, kept afloat by some comic moments of the raunchy, silly variety, and by something that does feel rather retro: a kindness to its youthful characters.__Overall "Take Me Home Tonight" represents a lateral move at best for its 24-hour party people, a step back at worst, and not worth your time either way.
More man-child high-jinks in a comedy which seems to be looking down its nose at smalltown America's terminally unhip, but proves good-hearted and delivers enough laughter to seal the deal.__These folk are undistinguished yet distinctive, and the film, for all the familiar grind of its plotting, pays them their honest due.__Considering it has to do with infidelity, bribery, drugs, drinking, loutish behavior, fraud and prostitution, Cedar Rapids is really kind of a sweet movie.__Cedar Rapids takes an inordinate number of wrong turns, but it also has an inordinate number of good laughs mixed in with the not-so-good ones.__In the dying days of an era when "big city" has been a relative term, the sales-convention comedy "Cedar Rapids" is a loving tribute to American innocence.__It's yet another comedy that's trying too hard to sell something past its date.__Helms delivers a performance of touching delicacy, one almost as remarkable as that of Tom Hanks in Big.__Like a slightly twisted, modern-day Frank Capra fable...__I imagine the director, Miguel Arteta, is the reason the movie succeeds as well as it does. He mutes the obnoxiousness and concentrates on the performances, nearly all of which are excellent and marked by a sense of real camaraderie.__A really entertaining effort, aided by some terrific performances.__Cedar Rapids is a quirky comedy that crossbreeds two common cinematic staples: the mismatched buddy movie and the fish-out-of-water scenario.__Such sweetness makes the raunch in this honestly funny movie even funnier.__When this mix of hopeful and edgy works, you get something like "Little Miss Sunshine." And when it doesn't, you get a cocktail with a bad smell, one part sunny to two parts vulgar.__Terrific ensemble cast in a smart, funny, sometimes sweet little film.__Sure, it may make you uncomfortable while you laugh. But only if you've gotten a little too comfortable laughing at small-town squares.__The movie belongs to Helms and Reilly, ringleaders who barely seem to notice that the script from Phil Johnston favors easy jokes and obvious setups. They, and the others, give this minor movie major heart.__The gifted Reilly is now almost principally a comedic actor -- and with good reason. He's the most lovable of goof balls, with his eyes rolling around his sockets crazily and a voice that sounds drunk even when it's sober.__These corn-fed Rotarians are such a cuddly bunch, and the movie's barbs are so pudding-soft, that it's not hard to get caught up in all the gee-whizzery.__Screenwriter Phil Johnston gets a surprising amount of comic mileage from the familiar premise of staid Rotary Club types getting crazy in a strange town, and there are some decent laughs from Helms's fellow conventioneers and partners in crime.__Miguel Arteta's comedy takes a while to find its mojo, but gets there eventually with humanity and heart.
The film is not about a straight man's struggle to understand how his father is gay; it's about learning that happiness is always possible if you're brave enough to keep your heart open.__"Beginners" is warm and revealing and bittersweet, if a trifle all over the place stylistically and thematically.__A strange and beautiful film.__"Beginners" is a delightful film - gentle, playful, creative and ultimately happy - though it's a tricky journey.__Excruciatingly faux-naive and sentimental...__Wwhile there's plenty of melancholia, there is also sweet wonder and celebration in writer-director Mike Mills' semiautobiographical tale of a straight son coming to terms with his own love's possibilities after his father comes out of the closet.__In his follow-up to Thumbsucker, writer-director Mike Mills continues to evoke a state of perpetual adolescence: the only fears given real weight are of not being liked and of having to behave like a responsible adult.__Beginners finds life both ripe with possibility and ensnared in the past. But then every morning is a beginning, right? If only we could remember that.__It's an embarrassment of emotional riches -- some pure and crisp, others cloying. This is a film that delights one moment and, the next, gets bogged down in its morass of feelings.__An affecting film by Mike Mills that makes a virtue of its own awkwardness.__It's a movie about untangling roots in order to grow.__Watching the film is like spending two hours consuming fat, sugary doughnuts of self-pity.__An effective portrait of a damaged individual uncertain about the meaning of love and commitment and the two key relationships in his life that teach him lessons about both.__You know you're in the hands of a superbly gifted filmmaker when he can pull off a talking dog.__Mike Mills' wistful, wonderful "Beginners" feels a lot like life - it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry (well, me anyway) and, by its end, you'll feel as if you've learned something.__Beginners is the story of adults who are beginners at love but who are slowly, scene by scene, moving forward in their journey.__"Write what you know," the standard advice goes, and filmmaker Mike Mills (Thumbsucker ) knew he had a compelling family story to tell.__Many cherish this film. To me the cuteness feels pushy.__It's a hopeful fable with deep optimism and a cheerful style that kids itself.__This is a bright-looking movie with a long face that seems to have learned nothing about life from death but cliches.
It makes for an absorbing drama and leaves the mustiness of cigars in the theatre.__Knightley gives a fair performance but lumbers herself with a distracting accent, and her gurning in the early scenes may be too much for some to bear.__The true story is extraordinary; the film is not, although the actors are all fine.__Like psychoanalysis, "A Dangerous Method" takes its time as it circles an opening to unexplored depths.__A Dangerous Method is a suave chamber piece: a series of glimpses of two 20th-century intellectual titans, in friendship and separation, and the story of a remarkable woman who history had swallowed up, brought into the light again.__Cronenberg has reached the stage of his career where he doesn't feel it necessary to pander to expectations. Instead he seeks to engage us, and he succeeds.__Knightley's portrayal is feral and unsettling.__A Dangerous Method is well cast with Michael Fassbender as a pent-up Jung and Viggo Mortensen as Freud. Keira Knightley&#8203; inhabits the fits and fury of Spielrein.__This is a freaky thing to behold: Knightley's wildly physical rendering of a mentally unbalanced soul.__A Dangerous Method barely nudges the freak-o-meter.__Pivots as much on political gamesmanship and intellectual dominance as sadomasochistic urges and infidelity.__It might feel almost too quiet, if not for Knightley's manic, borderline-over-the-top depiction of mental illness; she's unafraid to deploy an almost comic, grimacing underbite and a desperate, unfettered sense of panic.__"A Dangerous Method'' begins where other films hope to culminate.__Whatever the elements, Cronenberg has made a good movie from them, with outstanding performances by Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen.__Perhaps Cronenberg's most transgressive movie yet, one in which ideas - rather than their fetishistic signifiers - possess more energy and verve than the most calculated shock effect.__When at one point Jung spanks his patient, you may completely miss the erotic content and simply think what I thought - that somebody, finally, was punishing Knightley for this performance.__This is a movie with too much talk and not enough sensation.__A satisfying drama of historical speculation, substantially researched and shrewdly dramatized...__Using a dialogue-heavy approach that's unusual for Cronenberg, his film is skilled at the way it weaves theory with the inner lives of its characters.__It's a fiercely thoughtful film, a movie of ideas that understands how powerful ideas can be.
Although The Guard is primarily a language romp, it's also a terrific showcase for veteran pug-faced character actor Brendan Gleeson.__Brendan Gleeson is a blooming marvel.__Crisp, acid-tongued and sharply acted, it's the sort of exercise in tangy Celtic cynicism that's become one of the Emerald Isle's most reliable imports.__There are few things finer in cinema than Brendan Gleeson's fat, happy face.__McDonagh's script is agile, darting between the ridiculous, the sage and the surprisingly sentimental. His love of language and the absurd has hints of the wisecracking Quentin Tarantino. But the story is decidedly more rooted in Ireland's loamy turf.__"The Guard" is violent, profane and funny.__"The Guard" is not the most original buddy-cop movie you'll see, but it well may be one of the most entertaining.__A hugely entertaining but frustratingly disorganised film, packed with priceless moments which never quite coalesce into a rewarding whole.__"The Guard" himself may be no angel, but his movie is a wee slice of heaven.__Like an Irish version of "In the Heat of the Night," the profane and frequently hilarious "The Guard" watches the sparks fly as a smart African-American detective teams up with an unapologetically racist County Galway policeman.__Rich with inspired musings on pop culture, literature, philosophy, race, sex.__This black comedy needed to be a whole lot blacker and funnier.__Brendan Gleeson, as beefily Irish an actor as anyone since Victor McLaglen, is always believable and frequently hilarious.__When it's over it evaporates, leaving only the acrid smoke of its dialogue and the memory of Gleeson reducing lesser mortals to cinders.__"The Guard" is a pleasure. I can't tell if it's really (bleeping) dumb or really (bleeping) smart, but it's pretty (bleeping) good.__A nifty little Irish summer vacation.__If the movie's mix of nihilistic violence and snarky attitude suggests In Bruges, it's a family resemblance.__"The Guard," alas, is just as flawed as Gerry. But occasionally - when Gleeson or Cheadle or Flanagan is on screen - it's nice to pretend it isn't.__McDonagh indulges in too many '90s affectations, from blaring chapter titles to philosophizing gangsters. But he captures his misty setting's insular atmosphere beautifully.__McDonagh is your man when it comes to cruelly funny dialogue, and Gleeson makes it sing and sting.
Chandor proffers a cross-section of a Lehman Brothers-esque company as the realisation dawns that sub-prime speculation has brought the market to an ominous tipping point.__Carefully crafted performances and taut pacing carry the day.__Topical drama about the financial crisis lacks the visceral punch to grab an audience.__A methodical, coolly absorbing boardroom thriller.__Spacey is mesmerizing as Sam, a weary, aging lion losing his appetite for antelope. And Irons plays the villain with magisterial ease.__It's a realistic take on what happens when high-flying money speculators suddenly hit ground. It's also a great calling card for J.C. Chandor, the writer/director making his feature debut.__That Chandor manages to find the blood in each character is accomplishment enough; that he manages to make his drama both relevant and timeless portends a bright future indeed.__Margin Call is the movie Oliver Stone tried to make with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, only a lot less flashy and melodramatic -- and sharper, smarter and with a much stronger cast.__A terrific piece of entertainment.__Margin Call is one of the strongest American films of the year and easily the best Wall Street movie ever made.__Chandor's film is not a tale of the plots and counterplots of conniving bankers. It is a disaster movie, in which even the Masters of the Universe are running for their lives.__Writer-director J.C. Chandor then plunges us into a dark night of quietly nasty reckoning as it becomes clear to the firm's honchos that the calamitous risk assessments one of their own was working on might well be true.__This may be the first post-2008 feature film to dramatize the crisis itself, rather than using it as a backdrop for an outraged harangue against the banks.__The real strength of '[Chandor's] debut feature is how persuasively it depicts the fishbowl world of high finance, whose executives seem incapable of seeing past their towering salaries and privileged lives.__It's all fairly entertaining but also confusing for anybody who doesn't get the Wall Street lingo.__It sees its characters not as villains but, simply, as business people - with all that means.__A smart, harrowing and mordant drama set inside a fictional Wall Street firm at the trip-wire moment just before the 2008 financial collapse.__Though fictionalized and understated, "Margin Call'' effectively voices the same outrage that the Occupy Wall Street movement is so loudly proclaiming.__How good is J.C. Chandor's debut? So good I was ready to buy what he was selling even though I didn't entirely understand it.__A taut, smart and remarkably timely thriller...
__It is our tour guide that makes Cave of Forgotten Dreams an often thrilling experience.__The overall effect, aided by Ernst Reijseger's score of rising choral harmonies and lush strings, is rapturous.__To call "Cave of Forgotten Dreams" a great movie isn't just an understatement, it's a wildly inaccurate way to describe an experience that, in its immersive sensory pleasures and climactic journey of discovery, more closely resembles an ecstatic trance.__This is something more than a movie; it's a testament - and re-creation - of rapture.__Art history lessons don't get much better: "Cave of Forgotten Dreams" presents the world's oldest paintings captured by one of film's great visionaries.__What we get from this film: a specific and personal sense that 32,000-year-old artists, with all their ideas and passions, were not, fundamentally, that different from us.__We're never going to be allowed in this place, so thanks, Werner, for inviting us along.__What we come to love about Herzog's documentary is Herzog's love itself.__It was the birth of the modern human soul, and cinematic explorer Werner Herzog's fantastic "Cave of Forgotten Dreams" is the delivery-room video.__Herzog's voiceover is, as always, more entertaining than most film soundtracks. The film has a touch of that gray fuzz which still afflicts 3-D, but the Chauvet cave is a perfect candidate for such technology, because it stashes its secrets in a recess.__Herzog is reaching for ways to comprehend what he imagines to be the emblems of the birth of the modern soul.__The result is a journey to prehistory that's simultaneously wondrous and tedious, profound and completely nuts -- which is to say, quintessential Herzog.__Working with extremely limited lighting, Herzog not only gives a sense of the caves as a sinuous, tactile environment, but focuses on the movement suggested by the paintings.__Director Werner Herzog's latest cinematic mind trip blows you away with its beauty, though not necessarily due to its exquisite use of 3-D.__The unknowable or the mysteriously ambiguous in human behavior is what sets Mr. Herzog's synapses to firing with singular intensity.__If you're interested in the history of the human race -- if you're a member of the human race -- you owe it to yourself to see this movie.__The director is excellent at contextualizing these venerable wall paintings, at discussing them with a variety of scientists in a way that allows us to think about them with a perspective we otherwise might not have.__What a gift Werner Herzog offers with "Cave of Forgotten Dreams," an inside look at the astonishing Cave of Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc - and in 3-D too.__Has much to recommend it: Herzog's half off-the-wall/half-profound queries, a delightfully unexpected coda on albino alligators, a single scene on ancient weapons that alone justifies the 3-D process, and the opportunity to see what so few have seen.
Made on the cheap with no-name stars, this is no better than a stilted anachronistic curiosity, a low-rent version of the eighties' prime-time soap Dallas, with the industrial concerns and sexual mores of 1950s, all, somehow, set in 2016.__A talky bore that spends too much time in wood-panelled offices and at chatter-heavy parties that were clearly shot on the cheap.__Atlas Shrugged: Part I is in many ways charmingly oblivious to its inherent contradictions and the fact that its capitalist titans appear to be squatting in old, abandoned Dynasty sets, eating food-court baked potatoes.__Apart from its deficiencies as fiction, whatever its philosophical limitations (the rich and able should only help themselves in Rand's "Objectivism"), the book proves proudly indigestible on film.__This comically tasteless and flavorless adaptation of Ayn Rand's bombastic magnum opus delivers her simplistic nostrums with smug self-satisfaction.__The film is curiously sterile and lifeless, hardly the stuff of revolution. It feels more like an ideologically reversed Tucker: The Man And His Dream, written and performed by robots.__[A] DIY megaproduction... whose ambition vastly exceeds its technical command.__Ayn Rand's monumental 1,168-page, 1957 novel gets the low-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal.__The first in a proposed trilogy, "Atlas Shrugged: Part 1" is nearly as stilted, didactic and simplistic as Rand's free-market fable.__Though a bit stiff in the joints and acted by an undistinguished cast amid TV-movie trappings, this low-budget adaptation of Ayn Rand's novel nevertheless contains a fire and a fury that makes it more compelling than the average mass-produced studio item.__Don't hold your breath for parts 2 and 3.__A low-budget film with more than a whiff of amateurism in its writing and direction.__Atlas Shrugged. I arched eyebrow, scrunched forehead, yawned.__About to lose his long-held rights to Ayn Rand's novel, and perhaps to cash in on apparent Tea Party interest and support, producer John Aglialoro ... rushed this film into a low-budget production and it shows in every frame.__The acting is so poor and the story so badly told that the viewer's feelings about Rand's novel -- an epic ode to free-market fundamentalism -- are almost immaterial (though if you're a devoted fan, you'll perhaps be more forgiving).__This movie is crushingly ordinary in every way, which with Rand I wouldn't have thought possible.__Let's say you know the novel, you agree with Ayn Rand, you're an objectivist or a libertarian, and you've been waiting eagerly for this movie. Man, are you going to get a letdown.__Flubbed, under-produced representation of the first third of Ayn Rand's still controversial novel bodes ill for parts two and three.__Part one of a trilogy that may never see completion, this hasty, low-budget adaptation would have Ayn Rand spinning in her grave.__None
Will Shakespeare, whose words shine on, bright and brave, Is turning o'er with laughter in his grave.__File this one in the category of entertaining historical fiction. There are facts here, but one must possess more than a passing familiarity with history to be able to spot them.__John Orloff's screenplay could have used a rewrite by de Vere -- or whomever.__Knowing that non-Masterpiece Theater audiences will grow fidgety over this sort of thing, Emmerich and Orloff throw in plenty of sword-fighting, bear-baiting, and bodice-ripping.__The digitally wrought period settings are simply gorgeous.__This is irresistible as self-knowing camp: the players ham it up in high fashion and the script crams at least one lurid revelation into every scene.__What's disappointing about Anonymous is that it isn't dumb enough. Rather than plunging merrily ahead with its fanciful counternarrative, the movie keeps stopping to actually, seriously make its case -- to posit and explain and persuade.__Like vermin, facts here are banished / Logic dispelled, plain motives all vanished ...__Anonymous may not convince anyone, but it certainly should entertain them.__As silly as most of this is, Anonymous is undeniably a handsome picture. The costumes are gorgeous, with enough velvet and brocade to make everybody seem downright upholstered.__Audiences may chuckle. Stratfordians, prepare for conniptions.__Take the political intrigue of Elizabeth, add the backstage drama of Shakespeare in Love, and divide by the adherence to fact and logic that propelled 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow.__If you are looking for something more intellectual, and certainly more accurate in its portrayal of a rich period in English history, you will have to go elsewhere.__Apart from these few light moments, Anonymous is a case of ingenuity wasted on an unintelligent enterprise.__"Anonymous'' is a thoroughly entertaining load of eye candy with solid performances, even if John Orloff's exposition-heavy script practically requires a concordance to follow at times.__Don't let the frilly costumes, courtly language and historical pretense fool you: "Anonymous" is still a Roland Emmerich movie - a blessing when it comes to vigor and a curse when it comes to subtlety, proportion or sense.__Though the cast is energetic and the intrigues diverting, you'll have to distance yourself from reality to enjoy so much outlandish scheming.__The very qualities that fuel the historical hokum of Anonymous -- over-the-top royal intrigue and incest, violent literary backstabbing, frothing conspiracy -- also happen to make for wild entertainment.__As the Bard probably would not say, Anonymous is some crazy shit.__It's Shakespeare as B-movie, if you will, or to borrow from the bard, a boffo blast, which I'm pretty sure is from either "King Lear" or "Hamlet."
__It turns out that middle-ranking executives and even some corporate board members have feelings. Who knew?__Everything is pat, from the stereotyped characters (Kevin Costner plays the noble blue-collar worker) to the obvious plot turns.__There's also little sense of what these characters were like before reality came crashing down on them.__This is a film without spark. The frustrations are real, but they are neither terribly entertaining nor enlightening.__"The Company Men" is a worthwhile outing that takes despair - but also resilience - seriously.__The venerated American export that The Company Men most recalls isn't seagoing vessels -- it's hourlong dramatic television shows.__Turns out three stories are two too many. The Company Men should have been downsized.__This tale smacks viewers with a reality that's hard to imagine paying money to see in a theater. And yet, here we are.__It's simple stuff, but the movie's heart is in the right place.__"Glengarry Glen Ross" and "Office Space" made most of the same points vividly long ago. "The Company Men" is a lovingly prepared dish served cold and stale.__A serious, thoughtful and often devastating drama about something rarely explored in the movies: the world of work as a place where we go to find out who we are, and what happens when somebody defined by his job loses it.__Though not blessed with a cinematic eye, Wells is a gifted storyteller who gets nuanced performances from most of his actors.__Wells may strain one's sympathy by giving his narrative over to wealthy, white-collar men, but he also acutely renders the shame and frustration of capable, hardworking people suddenly forced to reassess their earning potential and aspirations in life.__Consistently silly, occasionally funny but mostly forced.__American movies rarely catch the American male so nakedly powerless and shattered.__As ham-fisted as Wells' dialogue is through much of "The Company Men," the phenomenon he describes is real.__The cast does the heavy lifting here and carries the movie over the predictable bits, exploring the rising panic of families who face the devastation of job loss with disturbing realism.__[It's] not a pretty story, of course. But it's a compelling one and, thanks to Wells and a cast that includes Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper, an entertaining one.__You are always aware of where the story is heading. Still, the film remains relatively entertaining, simply because the scenario hits so close to home, no matter where you work.
The movie, much like your own life, is best enjoyed when you don't know exactly what happens next.__Sometimes, when a movie emerges from a book, a crucial ingredient gets left out along the way. In the case of "Barney's Version," it's the wit.__"Barney's Version" has episodes instead of plot, outbursts instead of wit and alibis instead of growth. But it also has a star we'd be willing to watch in "Barney's Version 2.0."__Highly entertaining and arguably the most satisfying Richler screen adaptation to date.__This has the overstuffed feel of a sprawling, life-spanning story that's been wrestled down to feature length.__The parts are greater than the whole in "Barney's Version," a rambling look at a shambling man's adventures in love.__Paul Giamatti can do spunky (Cinderella Man) and stately (John Adams), but he's at his best turning potentially loathsome men into sympathetic characters that command your attention.__That rumpled grumpus Paul Giamatti seizes the title role in Barney's Version, summoning irresistibility and irritability to create a character as endearing as he is galling.__'Barney's Version'' is a smart, well-acted two hours at the art house, full of witty observations and fellow feeling. But, really, it has no business being a movie.__The fact that we can stand to watch Barney without walking out is testament to Richler's story, Michael Konyves' screenplay and Lewis' direction.__Yes, it's well acted and frequently touching. But it's the thoughtful, tasteful indie-film version. It's not exactly Barney's version.__The biggest shock of recognition comes from looking at Giamatti's deeply flawed Barney and spotting a bit of ourselves gazing back.__In Barney's Version, Paul Giamatti does what he does best: He plays a guy who is deeply flawed, occasionally heroic, perfectly normal and utterly fascinating.__There's enough Richler-derived scope and sophistication to provide grown-up appeal, and Dustin Hoffman kicks in some memorable scene-stealing as Giamatti's embarrassingly no-nonsense old dad.__We care about him from the opening moments until the end of this fairly long movie because we believe that his needs are enormous and that his passions and his loves are real.__A master acting class, courtesy of Paul Giamatti and Dustin Hoffman.__I wish I responded to this shrewdly acted, rather dutiful picture the way I did to the tumultuous Richler adaptation I saw and loved as a 13-year-old, "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz," starring a vibrant young Richard Dreyfuss.__There is a lot of truth in "Barney's Version." It is a mercy that Barney cannot see most of it.__The script doesn't need to convince us that the prickly and incorrigible Barney Panofsky is, in the end, someone worth caring about. Paul Giamatti's performance already did.__It's an impossible task trying to squeeze Mordecai Richler's sprawling novel about an SOB into one little movie. But they lucked out with first-rate actors.
Okay, since the destination is preordained, what does the script do en route? Estevez's answer is two-fold: minor episodic adventures + incessantly repeated montages.__Estevez takes full advantage of the beautiful mountain scenery, dramatic skies and ancient architecture to give us moments of quiet wonder.__Heartfelt if occasionally plodding.__With "The Way," writer-director Emilio Estevez has made a respectable failure.__It could have come out sentimental, but doesn't. The secret is the matter-of-factness.__"The Way" is overly earnest and clumsily directed by Emilio Estevez (the non-prodigal son of Sheen). Yet it is nonetheless effective in evoking empathy and introspection.__"The Way" is one of the better films of the year.__There is nothing terribly spiritual about the journey for any of these people, and yet the sheer arduousness of the trek, the beauty of the countryside, and the personal revelations that ensue all combine to create a transcendent haze.__"The Way" might have been a bit more eventful. Still, it's good company.__A sensuous, expansive hymn to travel and transformation in a movie that honors earthly pleasures as readily as it contemplates higher things.__There's nothing startlingly original about Estevez's screenplay, yet it has a modesty you seldom see when Hollywood tackles spiritual subjects.__Estevez does embrace the spiritual and religious elements of his movie. But he's as interested in the journey as the destination.__The father-son dynamic is played just right, Tom's sightings of his deceased son arriving at key moments. If only that resonance carried into the rest of the story's episodic progression.__Open yourself up to this thoughtful, moving personal adventure and you're in for a uniquely memorable experience.__Mr. Estevez is both writer and director of this film, and also turns up in a small role, but he gives the spotlight to his father, who makes quite a lot out of a low-key story that could easily have degenerated into mush.__A heartfelt project, scrappy and engaging, The Way has its way with audiences despite, not because of, its sentimental excess.__The dialogue in "The Way'' is sincerely platitudinous, and Estevez has less of an idea about where to put the camera than when he started two decades ago. He is - how to put this? - not a good director.__For all his awkwardness Estevez is undeniably sincere, regarding both people and nature with disarming good will and maintaining a steady, soothing pace that allows the life lessons to resonate.__Charlie Sheen, Estevez's brother, is nowhere in sight, though there are times the film could use a shot of tiger blood.__In many ways a cut-and-dried, by-the-numbers road picture, The Way puts Sheen on the Camino for a life-changing journey, but over the course of the trip, the film changes as much as he does.
Supporting bits, like the saintly love interest played by Deborah Ann Woll, function more as archetypes than flesh-and-blood characters in a lively story.__Seven Days in Utopia, of course, like most sports movies with higher aspirations, tries to position itself as more than a sports movie. And lo and behold, it is -- sort of.__At least watching Black fish, paint and pilot an airplane is less boring than golf.__Russell's spoon-feeding of motivational nuggets turns to full-blown shoveling in the film's final minutes...__Like a cliche tent at the State Fair, with lessons in oil painting, fly-fishing and church to help us all find our center.__There are no real bumps in that road, and though the drama has its heartfelt moments, it unrolls as flat as the Texas terrain, cast in an idyllic summer glow.__[A] humorless, mystically fortified golfing movie...__A cluttered, empty drama that uses (or tries to use) golf, painting, dinner-table prayers and fly-fishing as pathways to enlightenment. When that doesn't work, the filmmakers start preaching.__Until Seven Days in Utopia sucker punches you with a surfeit of faith-based platitudes, its upbeat brand of golf mysticism isn't altogether unappealing.__If I understand "Seven Days in Utopia,'' some guys spend their entire day thinking about golf, and God thinks those guys are crazy.__[It's] told in such predictable and bland fashion it dulls the effect. And this in a movie with Robert Duvall, Lucas Black and Melissa Leo.__"Seven Days in Utopia" is flawed in so many ways -- the editing, writing, acting and Matthew Dean Russell's direction are uniformly weak -- that this well-intentioned film does its positive messages a disservice.__Not a second of it is convincing -- or compelling -- but then the film is about "utopia," a blandly idealized place unblemished by hardship, malice, sin, or errant golf strokes.__I would rather eat a golf ball than see this movie again.__While corny at times, this sports drama -- based on David Cook's best-selling novel -- is sure to find a welcoming audience with its down-home Christian message.__If any film ever needed a mulligan....__All those shots of heavenly shafts of light eventually climax in unabashed Christian conversion.__Little more than a pleasantly passable Christian sports parable delivered as a sort of Texan golfer's version of The Karate Kid.__None__None
If you have even a passing interest in horses, you may find yourself smitten with this meditative doc.__Cynics beware: Darned tootin', we're home on the range here, where seldom is heard a discouraging word and don't nobody be yappin' that Buck is too good to be true.__Interviews with horse people, Brannaman's very funny, elderly stepmother and director Robert Redford help round out the doc, but all we really need is time with Brannaman, and Meehl doesn't disappoint.__The result is a portrait that expertly mirrors its subject: Buck is shaped with the same economy, restraint, and unfussiness as the man, to unexpectedly inspiring effect.__One of the most valuable things a film can do is to take you to a place or introduce you to a character you haven't encountered before.__It's well and good to hear Buck and others tell his story, but the film wouldn't come to much if you didn't feel the connection between his present and past in every frame.__You don't have to be a horse nut to fall for "Buck," one of those rare documentaries whose subject is so inherently fascinating that a fictional character could hardly compete.__Beautifully but simply wrought by director Cindy Meehl, this deft documentary is a poignant reappraisal of what it means to be human.__Documentaries have a wonderful way of making us care about people and things way outside our own experience, and "Buck" is a prime example.__Never has the special relationship between people and horses appeared more magnificent and even lyrical on film than in "Buck."__Brannaman is a fascinating character, but Buck is so tightly focused that only avid horse lovers will find it appealing.__The man's mythology precedes him, and it's the movie's failing that we don't understand how or whether he uses that mythology because he knows it's good business.__What I was left with was the goodness of Buck Brannaman as a man.__Buck has the air of a beautiful little mystery; even knowing the uplifting outcome, you wonder at the strength that brought him to this place.__A haunting, beautifully told tale about a genuine American original, who survived a childhood of violent abuse to become a leading figure in new-school horse training.__It celebrates a communion between man and animal that runs deeper than any division.__I don't know why, but I just can't get all worked up over Dan (Buck) Brannaman, subject of the documentary "Buck."__What a relief in times saturated with news of the worst of humanity to see something of the best.__It keeps you fascinated, even enthralled; elicits astonishment, even wonderment, and makes you grateful for the chance to meet someone remarkable.__Holds your attention and heart for a tight 88 minutes.
Alternately harrowing and humbling, this is a story of ordinary men whose compassion is tested in the cruelest, most profound fashion.__Beauvois takes his time limning the daily rhythms of the monastery, lingering on its most lyrical and sensuous moments, so that when violence finally reaches its gates the effect is all the more chilling.__The film, directed by Xavier Beauvois, moves back and forth between the monks doing their daily chores and the decisions they must face as a group.__Forgive me, Father, for I was bored.__Beauvois' camera is watchful and unobtrusive, panning the monastery and its spartan rooms, documenting the brothers' quotidian tasks, but also the modest ritual, the beauty, the illumination.__The air that "Of Gods and Men'' breathes is so clean and so cold that it feels like a fresh beginning.__"Of Gods and Men" is a quiet, austere film that is more electrifying than a dozen action movies.__I found myself resisting the film's pull of easy emotion. There are fundamental questions here, and the film doesn't engage them.__The monks don't speak their minds often, but when they do, the actors infuse their utterances with bottomless grace and humility yet very human dread and doubt.__This is a beautiful film, full of gray- and white-haired men who grow in stature before our eyes.__The climax is both misty and unforgettable: a sacrifice that looks like a ghost story.__One of the most austerely beautiful movies about the monastic life that I've ever seen.__A transfixing meditation on religious conviction, post-colonial strife and the force of actors who elevate every gesture to a loftier domain.__The problem is that a whiff of saintliness envelops the Cistercian monks right from the start.__Beauvois channels the pace of the monks' life, which is both his film's strength and its weakness.__Begins and ends as a testament not to God but to brotherhood, and as a portrait not of war's violence but of love's endurance.__Just as the monks live an austere, thoughtful life, Beauvois' direction is low-key and reflective.__Of Gods and Men, a transcendent drama of uplift and inspiration, reveals the cavernous divide between heaven and Earth.__Both a moving, almost abstract parable of faith and an all too real episode drawn from recent history.__Austere yet provocative, this is not only a film about faith, it also has faith that the power generated by complex moral decisions can be as unstoppable as any runaway locomotive.
The film's numb attitude assumes that Brandon's problem is beyond reach or rescue. So why are we watching, except for high-tone misery and something close to pornography?__The film is a raw, unsparing look at the downside of humanity.__It reconfirms McQueen as a filmmaker with an unflinching, microscopic gaze on the world.__Few filmmakers have plumbed the soul-churning depths of sexual addiction as fearlessly as British director Steve McQueen has in Shame.__Shame is something of a dirty date that leaves you wondering what went wrong.__[Fassbender is] so good as a man completely lost to his baser impulses that it makes "Shame" worth sitting through. Enjoying? That's a relative term. But you'll certainly appreciate it.__You don't just watch Shame: You feel it, too.__[A] graphic and spontaneous portrait of a spiraling sex addict.__Ultimately "Shame" emerges as a sex tragedy, and a story without an end; it stays with you, like the film's frequent cold rain, hard to watch and harder to forget.__McQueen finds the exquisite tension between the brother wanting to disconnect and the sister longing for connection.__There's a misery in Fassbender that's spellbinding. I rolled my eyes for most of "Shame.'' But never at him.__Despite the impression you may have gotten strolling some of the Internet's more giggly avenues, the most riveting part of Michael Fassbender's anatomy in Shame is his face.__It was frantic sex that earned Shame an NC-17 rating, but this arty drama is mostly slow and methodical. And thoroughly unsexy.__Yes, this is an affecting picture that leaves the viewer as wrung out as the protagonist. No doubt you'll be seduced but, in the end, you may also feel abandoned.__On a par with "Midnight Cowboy."__There's no easy way to shake off Shame. It gets in your head.__Shame has a lolling pace and stunning visual clarity. Structurally, it's close to perfect.__This is an undernourished drama likely to leave most viewers muttering a puzzled "huh?" as they exit the theater.__What movies so often relegate to the margins of pornography or sophomoric titillation is radically redefined here, stripped of its erotic charge and depicted as a numbing erasure of life and emotion.__"Shame" is all about weakness and compulsion. It's not about the joy of sex. It's about the utter despair it can't conceal.
The overly long Don 2 falls short on two key points -- the screenplay and Khan's performance.__It's a slick journey across Thailand, Malaysia, Switzerland and Germany which even manages to refer to the current Euro crisis.__As written and directed by Akhtar and thesped by Khan, Don takes such devilish delight in confounding his enemies' expectations that the viewer cannot help but revel in his cleverness.__Director Farhan Akhtar shoots and cuts the action awkwardly, not quite knowing where to place the camera, so the film never gets the slam-bang momentum it might want.__If "Mission: Impossible" and "Ocean's Eleven" had a bombastic, funny and slick cousin, it might be "Don 2."__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Watching Pina is like being inside one of Bausch's surreal pieces.__A remarkable -- and likely enduring -- tribute to an artist committed to creating dance theater drawn from humanity's deepest physical and emotional reserves.__"Pina" isn't just for dance fans or those curious about the latest in 3-D. It's a celebration of life.__A unique and often sublime artistic experience, "Pina" is a 3-D dance film that immerses us in the movement, letting us feel that we could reach out and touch these dancers as they float past us.__For anyone with an interest in dance, "Pina" is a must-see. For anyone not interested in contemporary dance, "Pina" is a should-see. It could change your mind.__Pina is a tribute of an artist by an artist, a friend to a friend. But its great genius comes from the mournful, as well as celebratory, reckoning of the performers Bausch pushed, collaborated with and inspired.__What might seem like a convenient bid for publicity - the first 3-D art-house film! - turns out to be the only logical way to showcase the action.__This meditation on movement and space, transportation and transcendence is not to be missed.__What the filmmaker has created is an inspired simulacrum - a jewel-box that contains more of Bausch's kinetic soul than film has any right to.__Crane and steadycam allow Wenders to get so close to the action that in the minimalist Cafe Muller, one's illusion of being on stage is uncanny.__"Pina"is the best possible tribute to Bausch, and to adventurous image-making.__I watched the film in a sort of reverie.__An exhilarating experience, both in its celebration of Bausch's groundbreaking work and in the thrilling way that Wenders captures it on camera.__Whether you're familiar with Pina Bausch's work or not, the new film "Pina" is a knockout.__So this is what 3-D is capable of when used for art rather than the commerce of hiking ticket prices and repurposing cartoons!__Pina is, in every way, a moving experience.__It should appeal to dance mavens, and to folks who have no idea what a pas de deux is.__The power and intelligence of Bausch's approach, which at times seems more cerebral than sensual, is communicated.__An intimate and ravishingly filmed tribute to German dancer Pina Bausch.__A movie that does more than demolish the invisible wall between film and dance; it breaks the barrier that intervenes, even at a live performance, between seat and stage.
The couple's story is related through small, true-to-life details that paint an unidealized portrait of love - the euphoria, the sadness, and everything in between.__It's imperative for director and co-writer Drake Doremus to color the film with a great deal of blossoming-love sparkle right off the bat, and he does just that.__Doremus delivers a tightly focused film that's all the more impressive for being improvised.__It's not exactly Casablanca, but times have changed.__While the film is often quite moving, it's also at times frustrating; people in love, we realize, aren't always as fascinating to the rest of us as they are to each other.__What could have come off as stilted and artificial is instead genuine and natural.__The cast creates such a naturalistic sense of empathy -- a complicity, even -- with the viewers that we're swept up into their characters' lives.__Belying its title, Like Crazy is a film not about the ferocity of love, but about its fragility.__Call it l'amour phooey.__A serious, deeply felt romance for an audience Hollywood most often bombards with raunchy sex comedies and video-game adaptations.__Those seeking a fresh take on romance will find Like Crazy almost existentially tepid.__A romantic drama that makes other romantic films look obvious and calculated in comparison.__Attention must be paid, even if you occasionally want to throw pots at the screen.__Although Like Crazy contains some emotionally on-target scenes, the movie as a whole feels glum and artificial.__This indie drama starts off as a sexy little date movie, but once the lovers have been separated it grows steadily more complicated and mature.__The reason to see it co-stars with Anton Yelchin, around whom the project got going. Her name is Felicity Jones.__It's not a clunky rom-com; it's sweeter and more intimate.__The emotional honesty of Like Crazy, which is comparable to Richard Linklater's great Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, is far removed from most of what passes in these goony movie days as youthful romance.__It's just the small story of two young people trying hard to decide whether this is an infatuation worth growing past, or a real relationship worth growing into.__We get that Anna and Jacob care for each other, but the foundation for their devotion often feels insubstantial if not imaginary.
__Few filmmakers are more assured or alluring, even when we fear we're following a monster.__There are few filmmakers -- David Lynch comes to mind, Woody Allen -- who have a completely unique way of imprinting a film. Nobody but Pedro Almodovar could have made The Skin I Live In. And that's high compliment.__These are questions one is left with -- and that's not an entirely satisfying feeling. Yet it's hard not to be drawn into the story, and even more, into the gorgeous storytelling.__Despite its scalpel-like precision, pic falls short of its titular promise, never quite getting under the skin as it should.__Only someone as talented as Almodovar could have mixed such elements without blowing up an entire movie.__Pedro Almodovar wows with the meticulous visual design of his films, but sometimes his narrative architecture is every bit as dazzling.__The story has so many twists and turns it's practically writhing, and I'm reluctant to reveal much of it; the movie's power depends on its shock value, and Almodovar does, indeed, know how to shock.__This film, by turns macabre, melodramatic, and gothic, makes the heart race and the skin crawl.__By the end of the movie, when all your questions have been answered, you're left with the exhilarating high of having been manipulated by a gifted artist in a diabolically dark mood.__As beautifully shot as it is perversely scripted, and you're likely to love it or hate it but not feel indifferently.__Though beautiful to look at and graced with moments of ticklish camp, The Skin I Live In is also sluggish, arbitrarily conceived and, especially in its sagging middle, unaccountably dull.__The film has more twists than a bull's neck and mucho polish (Alberto Iglesias's jazzy score also enchants), but it's more freaky than frightful, a "B" picture by an "A" director.__"The Skin I Live in'' is Almodovar reaching back to his sickest, kinkiest self, and it's nice to see him trying to luxuriate in sleaze again.__Time and again this mad masterwork has you thinking, "Oh, no, they wouldn't dare go there." And then it goes several steps further.__It may take a day or two before you figure out whether you actually like it. You could spend the first 24 hours merely trying to figure out what it is you just saw.__"The Skin I Live In" is like a David Cronenberg horror film as made by a director who doesn't fear the body but revels in it, who is too sensual and amoral by nature to find anything truly disgusting or foreign.__Almodovar delivers his usual satiny mise-en-scene, though in this case it tends to undermine the creepy material.__The film is an exercise in improbable contrasts. The more extreme the actions of the characters, the more contained and fastidious the director's technique.__Though I usually take pleasure in Almodovar's sexy darkness, this film induces queasiness.
It largely succeeds due to its charismatic, handsome leads and a cracking 'Spanglish' soundtrack.__Dogged by clunky humor and too much travelogue in the early running, helmer Zoya Akhtar's sophomore feature improves markedly halfway through by toning down the tomfoolery and getting to grips with the trio's emotional frailties.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
It's just predictable rom-com fare in need of a lot more spice.__The broad humour and cultural caricatures in the film's opening moments will be especially dispiriting to any English literature professors in the audience.__If the effort to shoehorn Austen's social commentary into a modern context sometimes seems nonsensical or forced, the actors-especially now-grown Spy Kid Vega-have charm to spare.__There's something crassly disingenuous about the movie's blatant demographic pandering (hooray for immigration-panic jokes!) and half-a--ed condemnation of gluttony.__Simply put, From Prada To Nada is Sense And Sensibility For Dummies, as set in modern-day Los Angeles.__The regrettably titled From Prada to Nada has more in common with a slapped-together TV movie than a timeless comedy of manners.__As modern updates of classic Jane Austen novels go, From Prada to Nada is no Clueless.__A rueful, occasionally touching and entirely predictable romantic comedy with a terrible title.__For a film ostensibly about the importance of finding a little spice and flavor in your life, From Prada to Nada is surprisingly bland.__A predictable but pleasant comedy.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"Melancholia" is a hauntingly beautiful meditation on depression that is as likely to exasperate as many people as it moves.__Melancholia floats in an air of supernatural malaise and tension, a melancholy mirrored in everything and everyone.__Melancholia will haunt you for days, maybe weeks.__A severe and ecstatic work of art.__No moviemaker I know creates psychodramas so hard to watch and difficult to forget. If we esteem Sylvia Plath, Vincent van Gogh and Samuel Beckett, Von Trier deserves our attention, too.__It's a credit to the director's persistence of vision that he finds such eerie images to adorn this wispy tree of death. Like a newborn planet, "Melancholia" is magnetically beautiful, but it's also an unformed mass of hot air.__Where did Melancholia come from? It's best not to ask. The explanation for the planet's origins is so preposterous that veteran science-fiction writers everywhere must be rolling their eyes.__Von Trier has thought his conceit through, and his vision was thorough enough to attract a superb cast to join him on his one-way joyride to hell.__Bizarre, sometimes tedious, occasionally amazing.__Dunst gives a strong, hard-bitten performance even though she is playing an attitude rather than a character.__The end of the world, von Trier-style, is a middling thing as a film.__It's a planet that can't come soon enough for her, but one that I kept willing away. Not, I'm a little embarrassed to say, to save humanity from Melancholia, but simply to stay in this remarkable movie's presence just a little longer.__There's something about the solemn, gloomy, often overwhelmingly powerful experience of watching Melancholia. I'll give it this much: This is a hard movie to forget.__The most composed and beautiful and conspicuously adult film of [von Trier's] career...__Pain isn't the path to sainthood but, often, only more misery. There's nothing beautiful about it at all. Except, perhaps, to von Trier, who continues to find it inspiring -- particularly when it's being visited upon pale, pretty, naked young women.__The apocalypse has never looked better.__A masterwork of grandeur, millennial angst and high romantic style, "Melancholia" takes themes that have marked the best films of 2011 and spins them into a blast of cosmic sparkle dust.__One of the year's most emotionally resonant art movies.__Von Trier remains a potent writer/director and master manipulator of images and moods.__If only Lars von Trier took into account that audiences might actually want to enjoy "Melancholia," rather than endure it, or sift through it, or submit to the director's will, he might have made something extraordinary.
In quiet, intimate ways, it is one of the most startling, haunting films you'll see all year.__Durkin intersperses the present-day scenes with increasingly revelatory flashbacks from Martha's two years in the cult.__MMMM emphasizes the social and economic discrepancies between Martha's then and now, and alludes to Lucy's guilt about not being there for her younger sister in the past.__Once we've got over the frustration of this promising film's abrupt ending, we're left with the feeling that you can escape a cult but you can't escape yourself.__A purposely disturbing portrait of a damaged psyche.__Durkin depicts a horror that some among us actually live, where the search for family leads to something familiar and dangerous.__"Martha Marcy May Marlene" will stick with you.__Sean Durkin's compulsively watchable first film is a psychological thriller camouflaged as an Ingmar Bergman-style country-house drama.__Hawkes is, as ever, outstanding. But Olsen is a wonder.__The horror aesthetic of B-movie producer Val Lewton -- that the unseen is more frightening than the seen -- is carried to a merciless extreme in this unnerving debut feature by writer-director Sean Durkin.__Olsen's performance is a triumph of constraint.__Shot in long, quiet takes of bucolic idylls, "Martha Marcy May Marlene" sneaks up on viewers with a barely perceptible sense of oncoming dread.__Masterful.__Two long hours of murky photography and slow-motion storytelling, in which the audience is always 10 scenes ahead of the action.__Sean Durkin's debut feature gets under your skin and burrows there; you can't quite shake it off.__The film has its gimmicky aspects but Olsen is haunting: She grounds the slim premise and makes it worthwhile.__Olsen inhabits Martha's broken world completely. And at the movie's end - a jarring, boldly ambiguous end - we're in her head, too, not sure what is real, and what is not.__Durkin immerses the viewer in a fluid state of psychological dissolution, keeping us very close to one woman's experience in a cult by any other name.__Olsen's unlined face is like the unbroken water of a deep lake, reflecting both innocence and guile as she maintains a marvelous and inscrutable presence.__A good film, ambitious and effective, introducing a gifted young actress and a director whose work I'll anticipate.
The unlikely combination of Will Ferrell and author Raymond Carver pays off beautifully.__I was not waiting for a punch line. I was not primed to laugh. I accepted Ferrell as Nick and, because of that, I was able to enjoy Everything Must Go on its own terms.__This isn't Ferrell's first dramatic role; he played seriocomic leading men in Stranger Than Fiction and Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda. But it's the first one that provides a glimpse at his possible future as a Bill Murray-style character actor.__Rush draws on the intense attachment we can feel for the mundane objects in our lives. For Nick, these things are talismans from a past that promised a lot more than it delivered.__In the end, Everything Must Go is something of a consciously static study in sadness, both well-made and wearying.__Taking stock and letting go -- of superfluous things, of worn-out love -- is a strong theme. But the progression of the script is like Nick's self-help program. We're familiar with the steps.__Surprisingly, Ferrell underplays it nicely, neither milking Nick's misfortunes for laughs nor asking for our pity.__The big picture is famil iar -- busted middle-age man, suburban alcoholic despair -- yet the details are so finely rendered that the overall impression is potently strange.__A superstar like Ferrell could coast through disposable comedies, but "Everything Must Go" is a keeper.__No great epiphanies, just a few days, a little perspective, nicely told.__Everything can go. Sometimes it does go. The movie tells a pertinent story about what happens next.__Will Ferrell delivers a performance of implosive intensity that rings true in every detail.__There's nothing terribly surprising about this movie's dramatic arc, but it's nicely executed, and Ferrell's restrained, almost gentle performance is a revelation.__Will Ferrell is evolving as an artist. Welcome to his blue period.__Rush extrapolates a narrative that is less jarring and more familiar than anything in Carver, but nonetheless true to the writer's tough, compassionate and intimately knowing apprehension of masculine defeat.__If he isn't careful, Will Ferrell is going to become a bona fide actor.__It lives up to its title in ways its maker never intended.__In truth, this would be rather familiar indie fare without its perfectly-cast star, who fearlessly alternates between bitter humor, aggressive desperation, and gentle helplessness.__"Everything Must Go" is not all the film it could have been, but is more worth seeing than a lot of other recent releases.__Rush could've approached this material in dozens of ways, but the way he chooses -- turning it into an occasionally wry, ever-earnest dramedy -- is precisely the wrong one.
Weir has always loved atmospheric locales and group dynamics, and here he makes the most of both__Eventually the film itself is something of an endurance test, and not as rewarding as it hopes to be. But it's a worthy venture, earnest and well-produced and occasionally gripping.__The abiding sensation, at the end, is one not of fulfillment but of exhaustion.__This is an impressive production and technical feat, but through most of it, I kept thinking about how difficult the filming conditions must have been, and not about the lives of the men in front of me.__he long stretches between stations make The Way Back an arduous road.__The Way Back represents an exquisite example of style over substance, of vast visuals dwarfing the characters and nearly swallowing the story whole.__The result is a film that seems simultaneously grand and skimpy. For all its faults, it's an honorable effort, though. I hope Weir doesn't wait seven more years for his next film.__There's little human conflict; Sturgess never doubts himself, and the men mostly get along; even Farrell's gangster is on best behavior.__The Way Back is fascinating until it becomes an ordeal.__The overall metaphor Weir was aiming for - this idea of enemies so powerful and a war so menacing and confusingly big that no place seems safe except a place absurdly far away - comes through clearly and stays with you.__The film largely misses its opportunities to reflect the enormity of communism, choosing instead the route of a conventional adventure yarn.__Weir's movie is superbly made, but its fancy-dancing around history gives a hint of inauthenticity to a film that otherwise thrives on its reverence for historical detail.__It's impossible not to cry at their suffering, but whether you'll feel anything is another story.__There are exhilarating moments, and there are some undeniably tense scenes. Mixed in, however, is possibly more trudging than you're going to see in any other film.__Whether it's true or not, this portrait of desperate, determined people surviving blizzards and dust storms and crossing mountains and deserts is a gruff and uplifting celebration of how much people can take and how much they value freedom.__Despite a strong cast that includes Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan, we never really get to know any of the sloggers.__This artful tale of survival against the elements - radiating terror and beauty - continues Peter Weir's fascination with characters trapped by worlds they didn't make.__How many new ways can you dramatize icy gales, parched deserts, agonizing thirst, shimmering mirages? And how do you step up the pace of a story that's about people walking?__"The Way Back" is a return to the historical epics of David Lean, a story of survival under unthinkable physical and spiritual hardship.__This doesn't sound like a lot of fun to watch, but Weir - in his first movie since 2003's "Master and Commander" - makes it mesmerizing and occasionally lyrical.
Brief, brutal and barmy.__Where previously we felt as trapped in Polanski's apartments as his characters, in Carnage we only ever peek in through the window.__The actors seem to have fun, particularly Foster, working against type as the thoroughly unlikable Penelope. But "Carnage" isn't nearly as bloody as it thinks it is.__What are supposed to be transgressive observations about the holy state of parenthood and matrimony instead come across as self-satisfied and shallow as the pieties Reza intends to puncture.__If we grant that "Carnage" is a low-impact exercise in stripping away the social veneer, it's nonetheless brisk and enjoyable.__In real life, hyper-controlling metropolitan parents would not waste this much time on people they loathe.__The astonishing Waltz steals the picture, possibly because he's the one with a rational perspective (despite his telephonic obsessiveness): He sees the whole exercise as pointless. Ultimately, so do we.__Foster is particularly impressive in a stridently unattractive role, as the pinched, angry liberal who's orchestrated the meeting but doesn't get quite the apology she wants.__Skillfully acted by Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet, [it's a] compact verbal slugfest.__An odd little chamber piece, "Carnage" plays out like a very tense meeting from which you can't wait to depart.__You may recognize the arrogance and anxieties, the class resentments and domestic bile, from your PTA's most recent talent night. More likely, they're as close as the nearest mirror.__A brilliantly discomfiting comedy of frustration.__Think Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but then think fun.__The entire point of  Carnage  is to poke fun at the fragile civility of the upper-middle class - they're all animals inside! - but how much more fun would this material have been if the story hadn't been about polite white people?__"Carnage" becomes a lesson in how to handle a willfully claustrophobic assignment with panache.__The point isn't the plot, it's the performances. Here four familiar actors seem ideally cast for their roles.__A film that makes its audience feel as trapped as its characters.__Despite the efforts of an impressive cast, the film starts out stale and then just gets tedious.__Carnage is a comedy of claustrophobia and revealed truths, and Polanski knows both all too well.__Seeing these four actors launching Reza's zingers at each other at high speed is pretty much worth the price of admission all by itself, and one thing you always know about Polanski is that he won't waste your time.
As stiff as it is sincere.__Movie goers likely will look over The Grace Card's entertainment value to focus on this simple prescription for how to gracefully love your neighbor.__Blessed with fine performances, credible dialogue and slick production values that belie a reportedly paltry budget, The Grace Card ranks among the better religious-themed indies released in recent years.__Despite its lapse into melodrama, this faith-based drama is surprisingly effective.__It's OK to put out a movie with a message. But rendering even potentially dramatic stories so inoffensive that they bear no relation to reality makes for middling drama.__"The Grace Card" is a Christian drama about a racist cop and his gospel-preaching partner who . . . hey, wait a second. Where are you going?__The movie amounts to a cinematic sermon that, like many of those given in houses of worship, has a good-hearted message that will be difficult to deliver to a snoozing audience.__The filmmakers seem more interested in coddling the converted than ministering to sinners.__Such over-the-top emotional extravagance that even Cecil B. DeMille in his silent period might not have been able to get away with it.__The plot twists, involving a shooting, a kidney donation and an 11th-hour apology, are melodramatic even by TV standards.__Its screenplay is mostly second-rate soap opera and its direction plodding, with many scenes held, awkwardly, longer than they need to be.__Steeped in Christian tenets of forgiveness, brotherhood, and prayer, and rife with earnest platitudes about race and family, The Grace Card is one overwrought piece of work.__A low-budget Christian indie that just clears the runway on the sincerity of its performances and inclusiveness of its message.__This Christian-themed domestic melodrama uses race as cheap window dressing for easily digestible bromides and a conclusion as foregone as a Family Circus panel.__None__None__None__None__None__None
A strong film based on a weak story.__It's a powerful, disturbing film. May there be a day when such works seem less relevant.__Rage has no expiration date in Incendies, director Denis Villeneuve's gripping, era-jumping drama about a family melded to its war-torn past.__A deeply resonant literary quality gives what might otherwise seem like a dubious series of coincidences a profound sense of plausibility.__It is no surprise that it was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.__Villaneuve knows how to stoke a hot debate about the legacy of violence. But in this case, where there's smoke, there's not enough air.__The movie, engrossing as it is intentionally horrifying, is capped by a last-minute revelation that brings the story to a haunting, powerful close.__If you think of Canadian films as the movie equivalent of cucumber sandwiches and chamomile tea, hold tight.__A mystery, a melodrama, a prison film, and a love story, "Incendies'' is foremost a scream of rage at a society destroyed by religion and by men.__Villeneuve's telling of her story - and of her children's - is painful, searing and something close to brilliant.__Overplays its hand, piling tragedy on tragedy until we feel browbeaten with misery.__By the end they've acquired a measure of self-knowledge at a cost dearer than they expected, which reminds us that what we think we know can be just the beginning of an existential journey.__"Incendies" is no mere riff on a Greek mainstay. It is its own entity, delicate and fierce.__Most people do not choose their religions but have them forced upon themselves by birth, and the lesson of "Incendies" is that an accident of birth is not a reason for hatred.__Azabal, a Belgian actress, has a feral, mesmerizing power.__The storytelling in Incendies strikes me as primal the way Greek tragedy is primal. Shattering. Cathartic. It is a breathtaking film.__Villeneuve has a sober eye and a steady hand.__This is the film that should have won an Oscar in its foreign-language category this year and didn't.__A kind name for this attitude is false moral equivalence, or perhaps post-imperial cringe. A less kind one is Western self-hatred, or an urgent plea to tolerate the intolerant.__Filled with striking images and the ghosts of lives lived in hardship and war, "Incendies" is tough but impactful.
The Trip is not about food; it's about friendship, one that will give you plenty to laugh - and think - about.__The Trip is a comedy about two guys going to fancy restaurants in the English countryside. Sounds hilarious, huh? Well, it actually is.__Much more than an appetizer, if not quite a main course, it definitely goes down a treat.__The pinch of pathos in this tart comedy makes the "The Trip" a transportive experience.__Think The Odd Couple with sartorial style and more bickering. Add hints of truisms about middle age, sex, family, mortality and the limits of friendship and The Trip reveals itself to be more than it initially appears.__The joy of this small, unimportant contest is weirdly addictive; you come out of the film as if from a concert, playing the music of false voices in your head.__The film is a wickedly funny joy ride that offers keen, unflatteringly honest insights on fame, midlife crises and the rivalrous nature of male friendship.__A comic diversion that aspires to the old Seinfeld gag of being 'about nothing.'__It's rife with observations about men of a certain age, actors of a certain career -- and for a bonus, restaurants of a certain moment.__Have you ever been trapped in the back seat of a car while the old married couple up front bickers and banters for hours? It's either sheer torture or, if the couple happens to be Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, wildly entertaining.__It's two guys traveling, eating and talking. Doesn't sound like much. But it's terrific.__Coogan and Brydon, as they proved earlier in Winterbottom's brilliant "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story," are a pair of pretty funny guys to spend time with; their riff on "We leave at daybreak!" is almost worth the ticket price.__Suggests a reality TV fusion of "Sideways'' and a Bob Hope/Bing Crosby "Road'' movie, or maybe "My Dinner With Andre'' repurposed into a movable feast.__A rambling but illuminating odyssey that has as much to do with friendship - and the competition and conflicts that come with it - as it does with celebrating the comedic chops of its two stars.__The odyssey goes on a bit too long, and I suppose a taste for extra dry British comedy is a requirement, but this Trip is well worth one.__The movie offers enough good one-liners, both comic and ruminative, to hold one's interest, but don't expect much else.__This is a great deal more entertaining than it sounds, in large part because the two actors are gifted mimics -- Brydon the better one, although Coogan doesn't think so.__An easy-going trek down a road well-traveled by these two.__During the film's funny stretches, as when Brydon and Coogan get into a loud public row about who does the better Michael Caine, I was laughing too hard to care about unexplored character arcs.__The whole thing doesn't add up to a full meal, perhaps. But it is, as one of these chefs might say, a quite delightful amuse-bouche.
Sometimes a film feels a bit too pat and yet is impossible to resist.__Without resorting to any trick plays, "The Mighty Macs" is the equivalent of high-top Converse All-Stars: timeless and effective, but perhaps not flashy enough for the kids at the mall.__The blandly inspirational sports flick "The Mighty Macs" is warm- spirited but all too obvious, even as the charms of its lead performer Carla Gugino help sell this familiar story.__There's something refreshingly unpushy about the movie and its beliefs, and Gugino seems to be sauntering through on her way to a different, spikier movie, the kind that is her stock in trade.__[It's] given such old-fashioned, kid-gloves treatment that its potential warmth and excitement caves under the weight of writer-producer-director Tim Chambers' good intentions.__Sports movies live and die by what takes place on the court or in the field, and this one feels rather rote.__It's sure not new, but somehow it never gets old.__Pleasing rather than rousing, informational rather than inspirational, Macs is more of a sit-in-the-bleachers-and-clap than a stand-up-and-cheer affair.__"The Mighty Macs'' sticks so closely to the underdog-sports-movie playbook that it's practically generic.__Stop me if you've heard this one: A hapless, obscure underdog team overcomes countless disadvantages to become undisputed champions.__[A] low budget, high-fructose but generally effective rouser...__Formulas work if you know how to work them, but writer-director Tim Chambers, making his theatrical debut, only gets the beats right part of the time.__There is nothing to complain about except the film's deadening predictability and the bland, shallow characters.__A saga whose cliched corniness (marriage isn't everything! athletics save the school!) would be practically sinful if not for the mighty Gugino...__The Mighty Macs appears to have been made on a budget equivalent to the cost of a WNBA fleece hoodie.__Writer-director Tim Chambers does little to generate suspense, and appears determined to immediately defuse any situation that even hints at the possibility of unpleasantness.__Too bad it's simply not that good, wobbling up on its way to the backboard and rolling on the rim before eventually making its point when what we were hoping for was a slam dunk.__This tiny Catholic school for women dominated the sport at a turning point in history, and this plucky, old-fashioned sports drama sets the scene and tells the tale with a lot of heart and a dash of wit.__None__None
The didacticism takes the shine off Weitz's accomplishment, even if the film builds up enough empathy to generate slow-burning emotional impact.__Bichir delivers a powerful, nuanced performance as a stoic but complex character who treats everyone -- even those who have wronged him -- with a dignity he rarely receives.__The people here seem real, their world is shaky at best, and the political tension that permeates everything in this film feels palpable.__Bichir redeems the secondhand plot and on-the-nose dialogue.__Personalizes the illegal immigrant experience and digs much deeper into what has become a national disgrace.__"A Better Life" might not change any minds about immigration policy, but it illuminates the conversation with context, compassion and understanding.__Notwithstanding its modest scope, "A Better Life" richly documents the life of an invisible man.__Weitz, who directed the excellent 2002 Hugh Grant movie, "About a Boy," once more does a sensitive job with iffy material.__A compassionate character study of a man modeling the values of heart, hard work, self-respect, and self-reliance to his spawn.__It's generic and small but manages to reel you in and surprise you with its grimness.__If we can see how things will play out long before the characters do, it's still powerful and, one gets the feeling, valuable - not just as a document of the immigration struggle but as a film.__A major star in Mexico, Bichir is quietly affecting as the father, a humble striver who faces loss at every turn.__The film's trajectory is rather predictable, but then so was the story told by "The Bicycle Thief." But the performances are pitch perfect...__It's straight, true and heartbreaking, a masterstroke of raw emotional minimalism.__Director Chris Weitz neatly avoids sanctimony by centering the engrossing story on a father-son relationship, letting the audience make up its own mind about the overarching matter of illegal immigration.__Bichir delivers a note-perfect performance of determination, defeat and pride.__Once you get past the cliched Spanglish dialogue and the sentimental tone of the early acts, "A Better Life" settles down into something both involving and moving.__There are sequences here, like the ones involving men massing for work on street corners, or working the night shift washing dishes, that highlight a closed-off society too often neglected in the movies -- not to mention in real life.__Neither hopeful nor hopeless, the story is about embracing heritage while striving for more, all the while trying not to step on the neck of your brother.__No matter where you stand on immigration, A Better Life is must-see viewing, poignantly revealing what it's like living confined to the shadows of contemporary society.
It becomes a film about her [Swinton] scattered mind. That produces wonders from Swinton, but it ignores the plea in the title. What about Kevin? Kevin deserves so much more attention-indeed, he deserves being played by Tilda Swinton.__Fragmented, dreamlike, a whir of memories and misery, We Need to Talk About Kevin is unsettling, but also somehow unnecessary.__"We Need to Talk About Kevin" is confrontational cinema that will leave you speechless.__Director Ramsay makes Kevin's impact all the more felt by coming at it from all angles.__It's a hallmark of "Kevin's" emotional bravery and intellectual honesty that the questions haunt us long after the end credits roll.__Some movies punish you, but you take it because you're getting something out of the bargain: an insight, a performance, art, adrenaline. Then there are the movies that punish you for the heck of it.__Ramsay may be aiming for a character study of Kevin, but she ends up merely listing the ingredients needed to make a murderer.__Lynne Ramsay's thoughtful, unnerving film works its strange power over viewers who are likely to find themselves as compelled as repelled by its fatally flawed key players.__The narrative strategy amounts to little more than film-school strenuousness, and in the end it can't conceal the movie's essential crudeness - its coarse, artless dialogue, blank character writing and intellectual vacuity.__Ramsay, filming in lurid reds and unblinking close-ups, lets no one off the hook here; this is truly a domestic horror story, with no easy answers and nobody blameless.__Tilda Swinton is the star of We Need to Talk About Kevin, and her performance is so complex and volcanic and transfixing that all of the film's flaws melt away.__There's no equivocating ... over the excellence of the acting by Swinton and casting find Ezra Miller__Nothing seared my consciousness like the stunning work from Tilda Swinton in "We Need to Talk About Kevin."__The boy (played by a trio of child actors) is so unremittingly evil that the movie begins to feel like a grotesque remake of that old John Ritter comedy Problem Child.__Swinton is astounding.__That the film works so brilliantly is a tribute in large part to the actors.__Kevin is an extraordinary work from Ramsay, a filmmaker with an uncommon gift for getting at the inner psychology of her characters through striking visuals.__It's a creepy and disturbing movie, but there's not a lot going on behind people's eyes. The soullessness lacks soul.__Acting doesn't get much better than the subtly brilliant display put on by Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin.__This thoroughly well-crafted, if rigidly conceived film could use a little more talking -- at least some therapy! -- about Kevin.
In my estimate, this unique and frequently arresting film suffers from the monotony of the lead players' affect, and from the film's urge to have its gloomy cake and eat it.__A hallucinatory thriller anchored by a deeply resonant sense of unease.__When future film historians look back at the cultural fallout from America's financial collapse, 'Take Shelter' will be a key text. That is, if the storm doesn't sweep us all away.__Shannon wonderfully modulates Nichols' portrait of a man whose mind and life seem to unravel before our eyes.__There's a strong, unsettling sense of disease that runs through Take Shelter, the best drama of the year so far.__In an era of empty entertainments, "Take Shelter" is built to last.__Shannon is astounding, playing a good man pushed to the brink of sanity, maybe beyond. He portrays a sense of quiet desperation -- a feeling recognizable to many.__Take Shelter is paced slowly and deliberately, which is necessary to make believable whatever is tormenting Curtis.__A work of hushed and persuasive emotional veracity.__The movies have long been mad about the onset of madness.__It's so stunningly effective at establishing a sense of dread that it's almost impossible to recommend it without reservations.__The chilling genius of "Take Shelter'' isn't that the threat is never specified but that it doesn't need to be.__A movie for this moment in time, this moment in our lives.__The movie makes you uncomfortable, but in a good way. Nichols has turned the current moment of American unease into a powerful metaphor.__The story of a man afflicted with fearful visions, Take Shelter is a film that's hitting the right apocalyptic trumpet call at the right time.__Taut, unsettling, haunting and powerful, "Take Shelter" stars Michael Shannon in a shattering performance as a man caught up in forces beyond his control.__The really chilling thing is how believable it is.__It's a film without suspense and with a slow-moving story that unfolds without surprise or embellishment.__A molar-grinding performance from Michael Shannon anchors this slow but ultimately haunting drama.__Here is a frightening thriller based not on special effects gimmicks but on a dread that seems quietly spreading in the land: that the good days are ending, and climate changes or other sinister forces will sweep away our safety.
It's as light and soft as a pink satin pillow, and a little overstretched, but it's also packed with bawdy zingers and pointed political barbs.__"Potiche" is a frothy French confection, a sort of ile flottante of movies.__The film is still worth watching, and the one fabulous reason why can be summed up in two celebrated words: Catherine Deneuve.__A charming diversion from Ozon's more serious films of late.__It's a cheeky female revenge fantasy that plays out even in the casting.__Potiche is a French sex farce with a time warp feminist message that's more odd than entertaining or enlightening.__Fortunately, for both Ozon and the viewer, the title character is played by Catherine Deneuve, who can very nearly carry a film by herself.__If you're looking for a frothy comedy, "Potiche" definitely has its charms.__It has been years since I sensed that Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu were acting.__"Potiche" is a pleasant, occasionally musical romp, and a welcome chance for Deneuve to carry a movie.__[It's] light, larky stuff. But the underlying message of empowerment and equality is nothing to sneeze at.__A star vehicle in which the star is everything and the vehicle is nearly an afterthought, and only a legend extending her time on film with pleasure and grace could make that worth your while.__Deneuve is unquestionably the single most compelling reason to see this production.__It's funny, broad and never stops moving. It's made to please, and succeeds.__Ozon apparently delights in making every possible kind of movie, often several at the same time.__One doesn't have to be familiar with Deneuve's body of work to enjoy Potiche, but it sure adds to the experience if you are.__Neither Francophiles nor film fans could ask for anything more than Francois Ozon's latest, a charming comedy that showcases its iconic stars, Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu.__This isn't just a film set in the '70s. It feels like a '70s film we're only now getting to see.__Catherine Deneuve radiates enough intelligence on-screen to be no one's idea of a mere trophy wife, but she makes a brave stab at playing one in Francois Ozon's brightly hued boulevard comedy.__You can't blame the stars, who after all these years go together like, say, love and marriage. It's just that the script, which Ozon adapted from a play, is lightweight and better-suited to stage than screen.
Captivating, chilling, and surprisingly sublime.__"Senna" is simply the greatest sports film I have ever seen.__A psychologically intriguing if at times too hagiographic portrait of a man who often held pole position in his profession and felt nearer to God because of it.__"Senna" is carefully edited and makes sometimes spectacular use of extensive home movies and videos.__There's not an ounce of fat or a wasted shot throughout.__You don't have to know anything about car racing at all. Instead, you simply have to like a great story, one that has all the elements: drama, inspiration, competition, victory, defeat, betrayal and, looming above it all, tragedy.__It's stripped of narration, talking heads, and anything else that might threaten to slow it down.__Even if you can't tell Formula One from Grecian Formula, Senna is pretty exciting stuff.__Most interesting for the way its construction builds on the inherent austerity of auto racing.__Real life eclipses fiction in delivering a tale that combines heroism, villainy, suspense and a surprising amount of emotional resonance.__What makes "Senna" essential viewing is the propulsive education it provides in one of the world's most popular sports, and the introduction it provides to an extraordinary athlete and human being.__Kapadia is working with an embarrassment of riches, but to his credit he selects wisely, and has the good sense to keep the talking heads off the screen.__Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna's life.__Senna is earnest, eloquent, and impossibly charismatic, and his rocketing ascension through the ranks of professional drivers - gunning his car at more than 200 m.p.h. down the straightaways - is something to behold.__The movie's assemblage of audio interviews poured mostly over astounding race footage is fit for a shrine.__Plays like a narrative feature, juicy and alive, with enough kinetic excitement to hook the Formula One-ignorant (me, I knew next to nothing about the subject), let alone racing fans worldwide.__"Senna" is a documentary that does the job it sets out to do. I wish it had tried for more.__There are some thrilling you-are-there sequences shot inside the racing car from his POV as he zooms around the tracks. It's like watching a video game made real.__Kapadia has, quite daringly, decided to rely completely on primary materials - although occasionally we hear the voices of after-the-fact observers, what we see is what happened then.__My interest in watching men drive machines in ovals is limited, and in this documentary the title character mostly comes across as an uninteresting dope.
Whatever leaps of logic yawn in the film's poorly cobbled-together arguments are papered over by its wash of button-pushing images, from regimented soldiers and deadly explosions to flocks of wild geese and sunbeams breaking through the clouds.__What "I Am" is wanting is a sense that it actually wrestles with anything, that it can stand up to a contrary point of view that the film's 76 minutes are so utterly lacking.__I Am is looking for a little bit of hope in this world. Happily, it finds some. A great deal actually.__An open heart can be a recipe for ridicule, particularly in a culture where consumption is mistaken for a moral imperative.__Happily, the frisky Shadyac does not sermonize. He is a puckish Sherpa to the frontiers of science and faith.__I'm not an ideal viewer for a documentary like "I Am," which involves the ingestion of Woo Woo in industrial bulk. When I see a man whose mind is being read by yogurt, I expect to find that man in a comedy starring, oh, someone like Jim Carrey.__A documentary spin through philosophy, philanthropy and quantum physics.__A film about this problem should have some larger point to make, some narrative to construct, something personal to tell us. This film has only whiffs of each.__There are great filmmakers - Chris Marker and Nanni Moretti come to mind - whose cinematic essays render their first-person musings utterly compelling. Shadyac is not in their league.__We're left wondering how Desmond Tutu wound up in this vanity project in the first place.__Shadyac seems pleasant and sincere - he looks a little like "Weird Al" Yankovic might if he became a storefront preacher - but as you watch his film, "I Am," you may well become a doubter.__It's not just that Mr. Shadyac makes big leaps and sometimes papers over contradictions. It's also that after a while everyone starts to sound the same: a little beatific, a little high on wonder, a little platitudinous.__In a heartfelt cinematic essay, Hollywood director Tom Shadyac declares "I Am" the source of humanity's problems. Considering he made "Patch Adams," I agree.__An optimistic exploration of what's right and wrong with the world.__Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky are among the boldface-name philosophers he interviews, but their voices are soon drowned out by a torrent of pseudoscience from experts at places like the Institute of HeartMath and the Institute of Noetic Sciences.__What lifts the film above its dubious boilerplate assemblage of talking heads and archival images is Shadyac himself.__What's wrong with the world? How do we go about fixing it? Is the fundamental nature of man essentially benevolent or cruel? These are all questions for either society's most profound philosophers, or the man who directed Ace Ventura.__An earnest, lumpy macrame of a personal nonfiction project...__Shadyac should be applauded for his quest. Whether the result amounts to anything is less clear.__Here's a rare feel-good documentary that earns its somewhat cockeyed optimism.
Sexy, filthy and thoroughly entertaining comedy marks a welcome shift in contemporary Indian cinema.__Shows, perceptively and often sweetly, a broader slice of young, urban, educated life in India as the three deal with careers, love and happiness.__Akshat Verma's script is imaginative and funny, the film's stars are engaging and "Delhi Belly" adds up to pleasing escapist fare.__A smartly paced, highly entertaining Bollywood gagfest.__The most enjoyably subversive element is Poorna Jagannathan as the self-sufficient bachelorette who waylays Tashi on his way to the altar.__Das and Kapur make for effective sidekicks, it's pacy, fitfully funny and, in its determination to upend cultural expectations, likeably mischievous.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
__It keeps you off-balance, constantly assessing and reassessing.__Capotondi's nerve-shredding puzzler will delight fans of Hitchcock and Polanski.__"The Double Hour" is a tremendously entertaining take on film noir, with all the usual elements of the genre in play - crime, death, possibly murder and doomed romance. I think.__A twisty Italian thriller that takes some liberties with its now-you-see-'em/now-you-don't plot points, but no matter; the way director Giuseppe Capotondi keeps us guessing is deliciously, maliciously deft.__A sly, triple twist of a film, this Italian intrigue is almost never what it seems, although everything ends up making perfect sense eventually. Along the way, though, it's slippery stuff.__The neatest thing about Giuseppe Capotondi's debut feature is how it reverses the mechanics of most crime movies.__If you liked "Dressed to Kill" or "Blow Out," you'll appreciate the ways in which "The Double Hour" artfully messes with your mind.__The movie's enjoyment derives heavily from surprise, which the script uses both to advance the plot and just for fun.__"The Double Hour" is an Italian crime thriller loaded with twists, and if it doesn't work 100 percent of the time, it's still worth a look.__I've seen the fabulously acted Italian thriller "The Double Hour" twice now, and for all its intricate manipulations, it stays with me for a very simple reason: The love story at its bittersweet heart is played for keeps.__The more you try to solve the narrative puzzle, the more you may want to watch it again - or at least argue about what's real.__It's a wild tale that's so full of surprises, reversals and double-jointed plot twists that you wouldn't think there'd be room for anything else. But there is.__A beautiful, head-spinning mystery that requires keen attention - and rewards it with a tricky and poetic payoff - The Double Hour is a topflight Euro thriller right up there with Tell No One.__"The Double Hour'' is a decent night at the movies, filmed with swank professionalism, moody lighting, and the proper attention to the curves of a lover's skin.__Nothing is quite what it initially seems in this twisty Italian thriller, the auspicious debut feature by Giuseppe Capotondi.__If the movie in total is somewhat less than the sum of its parts, they're still terrific parts, assembled by a first-time feature director who shows great promise.__A psychological thriller that is very heavy on the mumbo-jumbo.__Doesn't always deliver on its twists. But it works well enough that an American remake is in the works.__If, like me, you would rather get lost in a noir than try to second-guess its creators, "The Double Hour" is the best movie of its kind since the French director Guillaume Canet's hit from 2006, "Tell No One."
He was the first, and what's obvious from this lively and engaging doc, an original.__Whatever this Times-produced, TV-ready tribute lacks in tension is amply compensated by the pleasure of watching an enthusiast ply the craft he loves.__It's not just what he does. It's who he is. And he approaches it with such unbridled passion and joy that you can't help but sharing in it; absolutely no knowledge or love of fashion is required.__[A] marvelous documentary.__Here is a movie about a happy and nice man.__Filmmaker Richard Press offers a humorous, touching and insightful portrait about a subject who clearly would have preferred to stay behind the camera.__He finds beauty; watching him, we find joy.__Bill Cunningham New York is as winning as its subject, the affable chronicler of New York style from the sidewalk to the runway.__Bill Cunningham New York shows us a man who not only derives great pleasure from devoting himself to his job but also, in the process, has helped shaped the greatest city in the world.__Cunningham's work is about seeing and teaching us how to see, and that should be plenty for us.__Equally at home chronicling the latest fashions on the street and the biggest celebrations among Manhattan's aristocratic swell set, he might as well be the city that forms his vast canvas.__It's as much a portrait of a kind of artist as it is a document of a city's evolving sense of style.__Cunningham seems genuinely in love with his work...__I love this man, I love this movie.__Obsessive artists often create exceptional bodies of work.__Using the low-key approach that shapes Cunningham's column, Press works up a portrait that's as raw, gentle, funny, and -- in the end -- irresistible as the pictures themselves.__Those who pore over his fashion columns in the New York Times Style section will particularly appreciate this respectful look at a true local character.__The equal billing in the title is no accident: Cunningham's story is the story of New York itself, about the ways it has changed through the decades and how that history was captured on all those miles of film passing through Cunningham's camera.__Cunningham talks freely about his passion for fashion and photography.__A slight, glancing, yet subtly wrought slice of New York life. And it seems likely that the exceedingly modest Cunningham would want it that way.
The vapidity of The Art of Getting By goes beyond the anthill-sized dramatic stakes. The dialogue, while occasionally epigrammatic, is tone-deaf to individual speech rhythms.__The Art of Getting By wants to be sweet and insightful, but ends up scattered and slight.__A dull yet extremely self-important drama about rich, badly parented kids who feel sorry for themselves.__For anyone not in a similar state of age-related solipsism - i.e., anyone outside the 16- to 25-year-old age bracket - this is more than a little annoying.__There are several lessons to be learned in "The Art of Getting By," though all arrive too late to save this well-meaning but dreadfully executed movie.__Though Highmore and Roberts are appealing performers, Wiesen never gives us much reason to care about them.__You wouldn't surf past "Say Anything" to find it, but "Art" is a decent-enough entry in an overcrowded genre.__A half-baked little movie that proves indies can be every bit as boringly formulaic and artistically bankrupt as their big-budget brethren.__Smart and sweet enough to become the favorite film of some Midwestern adolescent who wrongly believes he's already seen the dark side.__Though it doesn't fully resonate as a romance, it is effective as a character study.__A charm-free wisp of a movie about that most annoying of recent archetypes: the mopey, privileged adolescent.__Even slumped over Camus, Highmore's a charmer -- and he carries the movie well on his slim shoulders.__Hollow and pretentious.__Someday every overprivileged, misunderstood high school boy who has ever come of age in New York will have his own movie, and one good thing about "The Art of Getting By" is that it brings that day, the day we can move on to other matters, a little closer.__To paraphrase Tolstoy (or, really, to mash up Tolstoy with J.D. Salinger), all unhappy adolescences are alike - or at least they look that way when condensed into 90-odd minutes of privileged self-pity.__In his writing/directing debut, Gavin Wiesen is both shamelessly derivative and inept.__For all his reliance on teen-movie formula, writer-director Gavin Wiesen is surprisingly adept at depicting messy emotions and capturing the spontaneity of adolescence.__At the end, I was wondering, what is the point?__Like Highmore's character, The Art Of Getting By takes a frustratingly long time to commit to any choices.__Every scene, and nearly every moment, makes you wonder if Wiesen has talent.
____________________________Equally as offensive as the movie's smorgasbord of smut and violence is the lingering whiff of colonial-era orientalism, a Western predilection for regarding Eastern cultures as innately idle, lascivious, irrational, and thus ripe for intervention.__It is a ghastly, riveting, dazzling piece of work.__The hero of "The Devil's Double" may get upstaged by the villain, but that's not exactly bad news for star Dominic Cooper, since he plays both parts.__Even more tasteless than its main character's gold 'n' marble palace.__The elements of tyranny, treachery and temptation are all there in one true-life package, but in the hands of director Lee Tamahori, The Devil's Double plays more like a melodrama than a docudrama.__The movie is too busy seeming audacious to add up to anything affecting, but its excesses are fascinating to watch.
An ever-so-tasteful, watered-down and unnecessarily-improved-upon adaptation of Lisa See's bestselling 2005 novel of the same name.__The drastic alterations to Lisa See's compelling novel about the lifelong friendship between two women in 19th century China are unsettling, at least for fans of the original bestseller, and they detract a bit too much from the story See so artfully told.__It's a coordinated, stylish dance, but the steps are awfully familiar.__In this lavish adaptation of Lisa See's novel, the complex chronologies of the parallel narratives are skillfully handled by director Wayne Wang, which makes his reliance on unbridled sentimentality all the more irritating.__"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" aims for the heartstrings and only strikes a few notes.__The film is visually sumptuous but emotionally inert. It never draws in the viewer.__It's the No-Joy, Bad-Luck Club.__Emphasizes melodrama over character development, until the proceedings feel like a rabbit hole of misfortune.__Once we've quickly digested the fortune-cookie message that modern women are as bound by obligations as their grandmothers were, all we can savor is the scenery.__Bears little resemblance to the book, and even less resemblance to a good movie.__A story of much visual grace and, sadly, considerable narrative awkwardness.__All the two actresses do is gaze out of apartment and carriage windows, through floorboards, into each other's eyes, and, once, while wishfully wearing a man's suit.__The film version of "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" proceeds as if willed into being by a particularly misguided "question for discussion," the kind you'd find at the tail end of a bestseller's paperback edition.__As movies about female bonding go, "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" is thin tea.__The juxtaposition of stories about women in old and new China may have been intended to widen the audience for Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, but all it does is lose the heart and pathos of See's novel in a jumbled mess.__[A] confusing time-travelling tale that uses Lisa See's 2005 bestseller of the same name to fuel cheap sentiment and a jumbled story.__Whatever passion might have been here to begin with never made it to the screen.__Wang ... needlessly pads the movie with heart-tugging gimmicks and canned melodrama that undercuts its raw impact.__Its story-within-a-story - a tale of two laotong, or soul sisters, in oppressive mid-1800s China - is gorgeous but simplistic.__You're advised to bring a hankie or two should you venture forth to see the tearjerker "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan."
Cahill's visually inconsistent first feature tries to beam epic sci-fi concepts into a micro-human drama, refracting its thought-provoking ideas through the prism of the central emotional relationship.____The result is an alluring image -- Earth above Earth -- a wrenching story and a wonder-tinged film.__In emphasizing poetry over plot, mood over mechanics, Another Earth fails to answer the most pressing question of all: Umm, why haven't the tides been affected?__Ambitious but ridiculous.__I was hoping that everyone involved would get hit by an asteroid.__Anyone who can explain the final shot deserves a refund.__A stripped-down sci-fi indie that made waves at the Sundance Film Festival in January.__Cahill fails to give the preposterous story even an aura of plausibility, and the unforgivable subplot involving a dotty/enlightened old Indian school custodian is gallingly sentimental.__It's a film that brims with talent and ideas; it stays with you for a while after you watch it, like the way a shadow lingers on a now-quiet road.__Instead of a fleet of Evil Kirks descending on us in souped-up space shuttles, we get a quietly moving parable of redemption.__The metaphysics function as a metaphor in what's an affecting -- if slow-moving -- drama about having to live with the choices we make and our need to find redemption.__It's one of the year's best indie releases.__There are a number of astronomical impossibilities here. What about gravity? What's orbiting what? And where exactly did it come from?__One of the smart, effective things about Another Earth is that it treats the discovery of a parallel planet in, excuse the pun, a down-to-earth manner.__"Another Earth" is being sold as an indie sci-fi drama, but that does both the movie and its proper audience a disservice. This muted story of atonement, forgiveness, and parallel universes is more of an extended metaphor ...__Not since Shane Carruth's Primer has a sci-fi movie done so much with so little.__This is no less than a meditation on the infinite possible variations that a human life can take.__A metaphysical treat, with influences that range from Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Double Life of Veronique and Blue to Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris.__Eventually the film reaches the point anyone could see it was heading toward - then blunts it by ignoring one big question and introducing another just for the sake of a twist. And then it ends, as abruptly as it began.
Hensleigh romanticizes Greene and doesn't have a very nuanced understanding of labor racketeering. That said, he does possess a fine eye for shabby urban landscapes and a nice way with explosions.__The cast makes up for some occasionally spotty storytelling and telegraphing of events that keep "Irishman" from being as good as it could have been.__What makes this film special and memorable is the character of Danny Green, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul.__Stevenson is big and swarthy and not altogether without credibility, but he's got as much charisma as a potato.__The problem is that writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn't do much beyond filling in the template; he's telling the specific, true-life tale of mob decline in 1970s Cleveland, but every character and setpiece feels like it fell off a truck.__There's an irresistible, Cleveland-esque, underdog quality about this whole production.__Stevenson is a good actor, but Kill the Irishman is standard mob fare, neither exciting enough nor interesting enough to matter.__At the same time overemphatic and insecure.__It's full of familiar old faces, a wee bit of color -- and, occasionally, a literally explosive charge of drama.__As a kind of St. Patrick's Day hangover, "Kill the Irishman'' gets the job done.__The setting lacks the gritty feel of the mean streets of New York, Jersey or even Boston mob movies. It is, after all, Cleveland. The story, which gets bogged down in detail, often feels predictable and lacks spark.__An extravagantly corny ode to the collapse of the Cleveland mafia in the 1970s.__In the lead role, the snarling Ray Stevenson suffers from a charisma deficit.__Cliched shards of mob movies that add up to the usual "Goodfellas" knockoff.__Though director Jonathan Hensleigh perks up when filming violence, the atmosphere throughout is past-prime, stymieing any strut.__Yes, we've seen all this stuff before, but we've never seen this version of this stuff before.__The structure of the storytelling in Kill the Irishman is pretty square, but the cast is tasty...__Flavorless writing and direction and a low-wattage cast turn potentially strong material into a routine crime thriller.__This mob-war romance could still find an audience in niche release, given its action-oriented underdog story and Ray Stevenson's oddly charismatic lead performance.__None
While he's fine playing bemused and beleaguered, Routh can't muster the edginess that Dylan is also meant to have. Diggs looks fabulous, but has his own problems with the dangerous stuff.__Brings vampires, werewolves, zombies, detective noir and spoofy comedy together for a murky genre gumbo with barely any flavor.__A monster mash and genre mash-up that leaves one pining for the swagger of Hellboy.__A cluttered, uninspired hash of familiar genre ideas.__Lets the likeable erstwhile Superman do his best impression of a jaded P.I., down to one of the most ineffectually boyish attempts at a grizzled voiceover in memory.__Put a stake in this film noir monster movie, it's done.__Never mind that Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is loosely based on an Italian comic series from the 1980s; this low-rent adaptation owes an embarrassingly big blood debt to HBO's True Blood.__As the title character, Routh has to carry the movie with bravado and charm, appearing in most every scene, narrating in the style of a hundred film noir private eyes. And he just doesn't have it.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
__A first-rate one-woman-against-the-system drama, a film benefiting from grim recreations of an ugly reality and a stellar cast determined to expose it.__In Weisz's eyes, we see Kathryn's transformation from a public servant doing what's expected of her to a crusader driven to by her own conscience. Her performance is terrific; the movie, sadly, is not.__"The Whistleblower'' effectively depicts the paranoia that builds as an increasingly frustrated and outraged Bolkovac is thwarted at every turn.__Powerful and revolting, The Whistleblower makes you feel as if it could have been even more powerful and revolting.__If this well-meaning melodrama contains a call to action, it's as quiet as a dog whistle.__You come away from watching the film with a moral bellyache.__Part thriller and part harrowing account of an outrageous, based-on-facts story of official corruption in the former Yugoslavia, "The Whistleblower" is a tense and shattering drama.__Director Larysa Kondracki's debut film is unsparing in its portrayal of sexual trafficking in a supposedly civilized world. But it's valiant, too -- especially regarding Rachel Weisz's performance as reluctant crusader Kathryn Bolkovac.__Somewhere inside this movie is a thought-provoking thriller about the collateral damage caused by geopolitical do-gooders. Too bad it never emerges.__Derives its strength from Rachel Weisz's intelligent performance as the real-life Bolkovac.__Larysa Kondracki's first feature successfully avoids the major pitfalls of the activist docudrama: the main character's heroism never overshadows the larger issue at hand, nor does exposition gum up the storytelling.__In Canadian director Larysa Kondracki's gripping based-on-a-true-story debut feature The Whistleblower, Rachel Weisz delivers a subtle yet riveting performance.__It reminds us that there are those, in war or in peace, who will always seek to degrade and exploit, with a precious few others to speak out against injustice.__A classic example of a film that doesn't trust the strength of its source material - or the intelligence of its audience.__Gradually, as her investigation deepens, and we see the true hideousness of what she is uncovering, the movie achieves urgency and clarity of purpose.__These cases rarely seem to result in change, and the stories continue. We can only guess what may be going unreported. "The Whistleblower" offers chilling evidence of why that seems to be so.__That you leave the film with nagging doubts and questions is not a problem. That you leave it with a sense of disappointment, however, is.__The Whistleblower is frustratingly uneven, but at least it affords us the rare opportunity these days to meet up with a movie hero who isn't wearing jammies and a cape.__It's a little sluggish in the first act perhaps, and not as slick as some, but it's still more authentic than most, and angrier, too.
Calculated to outrage and executed to underwhelm, Kevin Smith's Red State is like a dull blade slashing wildly, predictably and ineffectually at its target.__It's a charming if conspicuously unfinished film, a half-riotous, half-idiotic send-up of the teen horror genre with a vaguely hip political twist.__If nothing else, it's nice to see this director refusing to play by the rules of the multiplex.__Wants so badly to push viewers' buttons, but struggles to reach them more often than not.__For all its boisterous profanity and splattery violence, the film is more of a weary sigh than a sputtering volley of indignation.__The startling Red State proves that everything you knew - or thought you knew - about Kevin Smith is wrong.__With Red State, Smith ventures far outside his comfort zone of endlessly chatty films about pop-culture-damaged slackers and into exhilaratingly unfamiliar waters. He's taking as many bold chances artistically as he is commercially.__Add a bunch of forgettable characters (including a one-note Melissa Leo) and an ending which flirts with (but then flees from) a truly provocative climax, and you've got a project which perhaps only Rob Zombie could have made something of.__Red State is cleverly contrarian enough to get a rise out of almost any audience.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Attack the Block is essentially an action thriller and as such is effective.__Here is a shaggy monster movie that pulls double-duty as a satire of class and ethnic barriers, and how those barriers quickly disappear when we are forced to fight for our simple survival.__Attack the Block attacks the alien invasion genre with wit, energy and a cheeky insolence that makes it out of this world.__An energetic genre ride with social ambitions about race and class.__"Attack the Block" demands to be seen simply because it is a thrill - a pulse-raiser whose perfect construction and pointed wit make it one of the year's most exciting films.__The movie's amateurishly made. But the script is full of little surprises.__It's exciting, and there is plenty of gore for fans of that sort of thing, but one wishes the mix of horror and comedy leaned a little more to the horror side of the equation.__It's a doozy, offering tight and imaginative camerawork, electric thrills, and a sharp, twisty script that plays like a social satire.__It's wall-to-wall sci-fi pop-culture bric-a-brac, yet it feels organic. There's something more at stake than the fate of a movie-ish Earth.__Science-fiction buffs seeking a change of pace and fans of British pop culture shouldn't miss it.__Irreverently funny without ever being spoofy...The one-liners are hilarious, and Cornish has a deft touch at weaving social commentary on urban gentrification into the narrative.__Unfortunately, "Attack the Block" makes two crucial mistakes: It doesn't have great monsters. And it doesn't have great heroes.__This spunky, low-budget British action-comedy proves once again that a smart script can breath new life into even the most tired of subjects.__It's a mash up of Gremlins, E.T., a stoner comedy and a monster B-movie, delivered with a visual nod to 1970s teen gang films and reflecting the comedy smarts of, well, Joe Cornish.__The cast is splendid, the script quick-witted and the action satisfying.__A hilarious, slam-bang series of chases and battles that cross "Gremlins" with "Assault on Precinct 13"...__This fabulously inventive debut feature, written and directed by the British comedian Joe Cornish, never flags.__It's surprising this thing ever got released.__A clever blend of sci-fi and comedy, which pits toothy furball space invaders against young South London thugs.__Pulsing with a rowdy energy, the film works as both a sci-fi horror flick and a teen adventure film.
True, the resolutions on offer seem conventionally pat, yet the tough questions stay with you in an absorbing drama which pushes the viewer's buttons with effective intelligence.__Susanne Bier's latest meditation on grief and the boundaries of family -- which won this year's foreign-film Oscar -- is a tough piece of work, subtle in some ways, obvious in others, viscerally affecting throughout.__Simply put, this would be a better world if there were more films like In a Better World.__Despite some weaknesses as both a film and a parable, "In a Better World" is a potent provocation.__An ethically ambitious, morally thoughtful - and deeply vexing - drama about the fragility of civil order and the menace of the lawless.__Asks worthwhile questions about how fathers can best lead their sons, about the expectations placed on men by society and about their struggles with their inner violent impulses, which can lay so dormant and unnoticed, then, in a frightening rush, explode.__[This] encasing parable is brand new and immediately provocative.__I hate to rap this serious-minded filmmaker, but I'm beginning to wonder whether her scripts aren't better realized when they're held in check, whether by Hollywood star power (Things We Lost in the Fire) or by the hand of another director (Open Hearts).__I admired Bier's "Things We Lost in the Fire" and her Danish and American versions of "Brothers," but here her method is too foregrounded.__Bathed in a golden light that contrasts with the film's dark emotional currents, In a Better World brilliantly dramatizes the vexing problem of trying to do right in a world of situational ethics.__In a Better World, Denmark's Oscar winner for best foreign-language film, boasts the kind of patiently constructed narrative that keeps you leaning forward and marveling at how all the pieces connect.__[An] urgent and compassionate thriller about the vicious cycle of aggression and revenge.__The more its makers ... draw cheap contrasts between savagery and civility the less civil and more savage toward them you begin to feel.__Bier's perceptive, handsomely shot Oscar-winner respects our intelligence, patiently ratcheting up the tension while drawing didactic parallels between Third World ethnic reprisals and the escalating feud in Denmark.__Bier's well-meaning film isn't sterile, but she approaches the material from a distance. Perhaps that's by design, to make us observers, but the story cries out for more connection.__Despite its overweening tone of serioso realism, the movie exhibits little or no understanding of how real people actually behave.__Methodically paced and superbly staged to create a mounting sense of dread, "In a Better World" plays like a testosterone overdose by slow drip.__How does a movie about two boys fighting back against a schoolyard bully in Denmark wind up in a refugee camp in Africa? By overreaching, badly.__Veers perilously close to the programmatic, ever more so as the plot proceeds, and there are scenes where we seem to be observing a moral demonstration as much as a drama; yet the movie does retain grip and grace...__There's sufficient craft that you go along with the twists, even as director Susanne Bier is wrapping things up with a neatly tied bow. But in a better world, In a Better World would be a better movie.
Imagine a collaboration between John Ford and Wallace Stevens and you might get a sense of what Kelly Reichardt pulls off here: a sincere re-creation of the pioneer experience, brought to life through careful, often unexpected detail.__Greatly enhanced by the performances of Michelle Williams and Bruce Greenwood, director Kelly Reichardt's film quietly becomes engrossing - it almost sneaks up on you.__There are stretches that are, frankly, boring. But the vivid details and intimacy you develop with these travelers sticks with you, leaving you in awe of the insane feats people had to accomplish in order for us to enjoy the world we know today.__A mesmerizing cinematic journey that is often as arduous and spare as the lives of its hard-bitten protagonists.__This is the sort of film critics love to praise because the filmmaker has done good work before; and well, there must be something there. Well, there's not.__A film ponderously slow in pace yet kinetically charged with insight; starkly realistic yet allegorical too; psychologically astute yet politically resonant.__Those with the courage to explore uncharted territory will be rewarded with a rough gem of a movie.__"Meek's Cutoff" is more an experience than a story.__If you allow its windswept silences to work on you, "Meek's Cutoff" gathers its own snakelike sense of momentum...__It's the anti-western western, a story stripped of Zane Gray romance, sagebrush and mythic heroes.__Boring.__Vast and mysterious, the American West of Kelly Reichardt and Jonathan Raymond's "Meek's Cutoff" is not quite like any other landscape.__The cinematography, by Chris Blauvelt, captures the rugged landscapes and rainless skies with a homespun elegance.__Told largely in long shot, it's a painfully, beautifully slow film, which is understandable given the time, place, and situation.__Reichardt serves the broccoli of historical pedantry, deliberately withholding the delicious cheese sauce of entertainment.__Williams also starred in Reichardt's last, and best, film, Wendy and Lucy, and she clearly has a special affinity for the director, for whom she shows off her subtlest shades.__Amounts to a master class in the power of observation.__Reichardt has stripped "Meek's" down to bare essentials and careful emotions. The cast captures that quality beautifully - like the water that is running out, everything is conserved.__Reichardt trusts her audience, encourages her viewers to feel comfortable in the stillness and the quiet, and to draw their own conclusions from an ending that's as profound as it is enigmatic.__Under Oregon skies, there's political subtext for the taking in this terrific, unsettling film.
It's a bummer of a movie -- dark and at cross-purposes with both itself and any image do-over [Gibson] might be seeking.__Beyond the initial idea, this is kid gloves filmmaking, when what we need is a bit more of the gloves-off stuff.__The acting throughout -- Foster, Lawrence, Yelchin -- is superb, and this may well be Gibson's finest performance, just as it's Foster's most balanced job of directing.__The film is amusing, then melancholy, then weirdly funny, then not. It's a quiet, measured work.__With The Beaver, Gibson shows that for all his personal turmoil, he still may have a career in the twilight years.__For a film about the real problem of mental illness, it never feels authentic. Depression is not something neatly tied up. If this is meant as an allegory, it's vague and unconvincing.__If anyone can see past the suggestive title, the oddball premise and the controversial casting of this film, they might be surprised to find it surprisingly tolerable.__Gibson's performance as Walter Black ranks among the best of his career.__"The Beaver" isn't a perfect film, but it's challenging and original.__That this ambitious, if deeply odd, film is so compulsively watchable is a credit to Gibson's compelling performances, both as spiritless Walter and the Cockney-accented voice of the tireless title character.__I respected The Beaver for having the conviction to treat mental illness seriously and without compromise. But did it have to be so maudlin, too?__In The Beaver, a stately family drama with a black comedy struggling to break free from within, Mel Gibson deploys a seemingly magical hand puppet -- plus more charm than he's allowed out in public in years.__I've rarely seen a movie about severe malcontents that ended on such a note of unearned uplift.__You won't be the only one anticipating a car-crash appeal in The Beaver , that eerie sensation of not being able to look away from catastrophe.__Sure, there's lots of pretense but it's all the wrong kind -- just silliness posing as sensitivity pretending to be art.__If you continue to be fascinated by this talented, volatile, messed-up man, it's worth experiencing what may be Gibson's finest performance to date.__Admittedly, Gibson is very good as the deeply disturbed hero - particularly as he sits alone slugging vodka or mourning the loss of his family's love. But is this really acting? Is it even a performance?__Though Kyle Killen's script becomes trite and predictable, Gibson delivers in an uncompromising way.__If you can get past your feelings for the troubled Gibson, you get to watch a high-wire performance of the highest caliber.__Despite some missteps, this film stands as a moving portrait of a husband and father who reclaims his will to live with the unlikely help of a hand puppet. And the main reason it's so moving? Mel Gibson.
Not often does a film double as a literary critic, but this is the Northrop Frye of docs. Essentially, it revises and sharpens the blunted reputation of a great writer.__Audiences interested in Jewish literature will find Laughing in the Darkness compelling for its deep analysis of Aleichem's works, featuring a selection of experts and the writer's granddaughter, Bel Kaufman.__[An] absorbing PBS-style documentary.__Throughout the film, Dorman uses ethnographic and silent-cinema footage, along with ubiquitous klezmer music, to paint a picture of the era.__A rich, winning documentary...__The film adroitly sets the writer's works, his triumphs and tribulations, against the backdrop of a tumultuous period for European Jewry.__Dorman makes the case that Aleichem is the source from whence flows modern Jewish humor.__This is a person you'd enjoy spending time with and learning from. That's certainly the case with Dorman's film.__Wonderfully rich, like one of Tevye's monologues, Joseph Dorman's "Sholem Aleichem: Laughing in the Darkness" captures the spirit of a man and his times.__There are many scholars and critics here, most of them useful and pleasant, who obviously love him.__There's much more to Aleichem the man and the writer than just the musings of a milkman.__A highly accessible and sharply drawn film.__Joseph Dorman's intelligent if conventional bio-doc of Sholem Aleichem proves particularly revealing, since the famed, dandyish Yiddish writer led a life as full of colorful ironies as the motormouth schlemiels that populate his stories.__It is a rich, beautifully organized and illustrated modern history of Eastern European Jewry examined through the life and work of the author, born Sholem Rabinovich in Pereyaslav (near Kiev) in 1859.__Starts off looking like a glorified DVD extra for "Fiddler on the Roof," but it eventually becomes a far more gemutlich portrait of the creator of Tevye the Milkman, who took the pen name of Sholem Aleichem.__In the spirit of the Sholem Aleichem oeuvre, Laughing in the Darkness is a collective family album.__None__None__None__None
Vera Farmiga makes a heavenly debut as a director with Higher Ground, a compelling drama about a woman's spiritual journey.__The film's quiet realism demands from us our own act of faith: We're asked to watch closely and to listen intently in the promise of a greater reward to come. Well, the promise is partly kept.__Farmiga's first film is good enough to make us look forward to her next one.__The film is refreshingly free of proselytizing. In its place, however, is a whiff of condescension.__This film might easily have settled for mocking religion. Instead, it's a fascinating glimpse into a culture that forces some people to choose between fitting in and opting out.__At times, these analogies feel forced. But give the rookie filmmaker credit for visual storytelling.__Farmiga is terrific, but her clear vision as a director and her ability to play fair with believers and skeptics alike provides the balance and insight needed to ground the film in thoughtful reality.__There's a gentleness to "Higher Ground" that's very appealing; you sense a real affection for all the characters, particularly the women, and a genuine curiosity about religion as a guiding principal in one's life.__The film is ultimately a message movie about the virtue of independent thinking, offering plenty of small insights but no revelations.__"Higher Ground'' is a noble failure, a case of an artist loving a character so much that she loses sight of why.__The movie is flushed with hope, wonder, heartbreak.__"Higher Ground" shines a light on an important aspect of the human experience, one not often explored onscreen, and contains a number of notable performances - not the least of which is Farmiga in the central role.__"Higher Ground" glides and takes time to explore. In the best way it feels very '70s: It's about a relatable lost soul finding herself.__In a world where believers and agnostics are polarized and hold simplified ideas about each other, it takes a step back and sees faith as a series of choices that should be freely made.__The crucial thing about Higher Ground is that it takes at face value the faces, many bearded, almost all beatific, that the camera surveys -- quite an achievement, given Hollywood's woeful record in the dramatizing of faith.__Higher Ground is one of the few open-minded Hollywood movies about Christian fundamentalism, but the mind isn't sufficiently exploratory.__It's a movie of glances, emotions that pass between characters - which the camera, and the other characters, sometimes inconveniently notice.__Most contemporary movies either treat religion uncri tically or mock it outright. This promising directing debut by whip-smart actress Vera Farmiga ("Up in the Air") takes another, more interesting path.__This would be tricky territory for the most experienced director, but I can't remember the last time I saw organized religion handled in such an even-handed, thoughtful manner.__Corinne's journey is riveting not because she seeks the divine, but because she finds herself.
Familiar though it may be, as samurai movies go, 13 Assassins" is a killer.__This slam-bang remake of a 1963 feature by Eichi Kudo builds slowly, accumulating characters and themes, then explodes into a prolonged and masterful battle sequence inside a deserted town.__One can pinpoint the exact moment when 13 Assassins transforms from vivid samurai drama to insane work of genius.__Epic. Unforgettable. Relentless. Magnificently entertaining.__Though 13 Assassins' setup could stand some tightening, it's all necessary prelude to a spectacular, action-packed final hour where all hell breaks loose and the streets and rooftops flow with blood.__Does Guinness World Records have an entry for longest on-screen fight? If it doesn't, Takashi Miike's "13 Assassins" just set it. And if a record actually exists, Miike's film just broke it.__The dialectic about duty may not translate to a modern Western audience, but the savage sword-fighting is to die for.__"13 Assassins" has what many action pictures need, a villain who transcends evil and ascends to a realm of barbaric madness.__A richly cathartic experience with a wide range of emotional colors.__13 Assassins is a savage, insane movie - in the best way possible.__A film, like so many samurai stories (and American westerns) about brotherhood, justice and sacrifice, 13 Assassins is, at turns, thrilling and funny, visually exquisite and emotionally charged.__Epic in scope, ambition, and execution, it's a classic swords-and-samurai film with postmodern blood and guts, and it's completely satisfying.__The film is built as a long crescendo, opening at a level of considered, Zen-like reflection and ending with a prolonged cacophony of elaborate, town-wide annihilation.__Has a mixture of bloodletting and exultation that would make Sam Peckinpah sit up in his grave and howl with pleasure.__13 Assassins is reliably entertaining, but ultimately it's too traditional to be a classic.__The great thing, typically, about a Takashi Miike film is that there's no such thing as a typical Takashi Miike film.__"13 Assassins" is a must-see for Miike's passionate legion of fans. But even action buffs who've never seen any of his films before will be drawn in by this masterful exercise in cinematic butchery.__A classic samurai movie, right up there among the finest in the genre.__"13 Assassins" isn't just an action adventure with horror credentials, but a study in criminal pathology.__A stirring, unexpectedly moving story of love and blood...
The gay coming-of-age story's been done, but "Pariah" has something fresh to say, largely about the knotty complexities of love, and how they might keep someone in the closet: How badly do you need to be free, to hurt the people you love?__Rees brings a heartfelt connection to the material, based on her own coming-out story, but the film's ingredients aren't the freshest.__You don't have to be black or lesbian or even know someone who's gay to appreciate "Pariah"; you just have to have gone through or be going through the process of growing up.__"Pariah" is a small film about a big subject: the struggle to be who you are, not who others would like you to be.____If the destination is trite, the journey isn't - it comes with an ample supply of raw honesty.__Rees tells Alike's story in vignettes that are sometimes slapstick, sometimes heartbreaking, always tender.__Especially rewarding about Oduye's performance is how she's able to portray that frustration while retaining hope and optimism.__Rees' script, peppered with colourful hip-hop argot, is smart and economical, with well-drawn characters, dialogue and situations that echo with authenticity.__"Pariah" feels a lot like life, at its most confusing, contradictory and exhilarating.__Adepero Oduye is excellent as a Brooklyn teen coming to terms with her sexual identity in this gritty film__The originality lies in the details, and the dramatic energy that sustains almost every scene.__An eloquent, haunting coming-of-age/ coming-out tale...__"Pariah'' really feels like something rare.__Rees packs a lot into a simple narrative, and only rarely overpacks.__The film is an impressive debut for writer-director Dee Rees.__Pariah is a tender, sporadically goofy, yet candid examination of emergent identity.__In her fearless, world-here-I-am! debut Pariah, writer-director Dee Rees demonstrates, with simplicity and verve, that there's no substitute for authenticity.__The filmmaking is often wayward, the scenes of confrontation sometimes too stagey, but Oduye is a marvelous young actress with a camera-ready face brimming with soulfulness.__The movie's point, which is impossible to miss, is that it's hard being black & gay in America and, while there's undoubtedly truth in that sentiment, it doesn't necessarily make for a compelling motion picture circa 2011.
__Forks Over Knives is a middling documentary but a magnificent indictment.__Forks over Knives is tasty but somewhat undercooked.__Movies are like food. There are popcorn pictures that entertain you and the spinach movies that are good for you. In more ways than one, Forks Over Knives is a spinach flick.__A persuasive documentary on the health benefits of a whole-foods and plant-based diet.__As it stands, "Forks" is an interesting and informative health lecture that's sandwiched into a dry, repetitive documentary.__The radical notion at the heart of the acclaimed doc "Forks Over Knives" is that eating animals and animal-produced foods has costs -- on our economy, our health-care system and on ourselves.__A must-see movie that could have used a sharper edge.__Fulkerson methodically makes the case that we've been brainwashed by repetition and clever advertising campaigns.__It isn't possible to examine the scientific arguments in a movie review, but as advocacy documentaries go, this is a pretty good one.__The bottom line: I am convinced this message is true. A plant-based whole foods diet is healthy.__Instead of preaching, why don't the nutrition Nazis figure out a way to make plant-based foods taste better? You are never going to force an entire population to live on spinach.__It lacks the authority, simple displays of hard numbers, contrary voices and the like, that we need from a documentary this provocative.__One of the more convincing, radical and politically volatile docus to come out of the burgeoning good-food genre.__Makes a pedantic yet persuasive case for banishing meat and dairy from the dinner table.__Sound advice, perhaps, but it's presented in deadly dull fashion -- talking heads and academic charts -- reminiscent of an infomercial.__Explains in unflinching detail how we damage ourselves through our eating habits yet insists that it is within our grasp to change course.__Even if you're a junk-food junkie, this exploration of the health benefits of a ''plant-based diet'' is so scrupulously researched and argued that only a fool would ignore its findings.__Makes effective use of case studies and graphs to build a convincing, if inevitably simplified, argument for better living through fresh produce.__Beyond the film's awkward reliance on stock footage and explanations of basic biology is an interesting overview of the work of two men, scientist Colin Campbell and surgeon Caldwell Esselstyn.
__A swirl of action and information punctuated by chase scene after glorious chase scene.__You're going to have to track "Point Blank" down, but if you're looking for a real slice of what the thriller cinema perpetually promises and so rarely delivers -- pure force from up close -- it's one of the standout secrets of the year.__Put aside any hang-ups you may have about subtitles. As action flicks go, "Point Blank" is right on target.__The acting is impeccable from top to bottom, and the relentless pace keeps us from fretting about niggling defects.__[A] finely calibrated French neonoir.__All right, this is how to make a thriller: Start with a situation of astonishing difficulty and emotional weight. Then multiply. And keep piling on.__If the storyline doesn't amount to much more than B-movie leftovers, there isn't an ounce of fat on them.__Frantic, violent and unrelenting, it is all of a piece, its tightly packed storytelling making cassoulet of its own implausibilities and familiar terrain covering a web of political and institutional conspiracy.__This is the kind of movie where you get involved first and ask questions later.__"Point Blank" keeps the adrenaline flowing well past the point at which viewers stop hoping for twists they can't predict.__Point Blank is so ridiculously successful at keeping its momentum going - and keeping the audience tense with suspense - that it's likely to leave you with your heart pounding, gasping for breath.__See it now - before they start rewriting it to make room for bedpan jokes, exploding 18-wheelers and Shia LaBeouf.__The twists and turns involve a high-level assassination, corrupt cops, squint-inducing violence and plenty of fearlessness.__"Point Blank" starts with a pulse-quickening chase down flights of stairs and across Parisian rooftops, and continues with blistering action that doesn't let up until the closing credits.__"Point Blank" will leave you breathless. Unfolding at a blistering clip from its slam-bang opening through its bravura close, it grips you at frame one and doesn't let go.__[A] preposterously exciting-and pleasingly preposterous-French-language thriller...__An exhilarating adrenaline rush with breakneck momentum so shrewdly calculated that you could imagine its French director, Fred Cavaye, standing by with a heart-rate monitor.__Director Fred Cavaye has a reputation in France for getting the audience's pulse pounding, and in Point Blank, he does that while mixing in some intriguing social themes and character types that are usually outsiders to the genre.__It wants only to thrill -- and so it does.
____"The Hedgehog" sneaks up on you with its heartfelt storytelling and sophisticated wit.__A satisfying emotional experience.__A reminder that, sometimes, the movies can get a beloved book exactly right.__This a movie with such a light, stylish touch, it makes no claims to profundity and is a sweetly hopeful experience.__"The Hedgehog" is a treat: a movie that's smart, grown-up, wry and deeply moving.__Enchantment will go a long way toward overcoming implausibility, but there's not enough of the former here - and far too much of the latter.__What does happen seems to happen in slow motion.__An enchanting grown-up fairy tale about the redemptive power of love.__Balasko, however, makes The Hedgehog worth seeing.__Comedy and tragedy are given equal respect, and even the quietest souls are valued.__An exquisite, intimate film of restraint and delicacy.__Gentle, tender and very French, "The Hedgehog" is cinematic poetry -- too bad about that prosaic plotting.__The film's moral can be distilled in the famous E. M. Forster dictum from "Howards End": "only connect." This endearing, if somewhat twee, movie gently reminds you of its truth.__The Hedgehog is not exactly a naturalistic drama, and its winsome charm and annoying contrivance are thoroughly intertwined.__The sweet, the comic and the tragic blend together most agreeably in the winsome French romance "The Hedgehog."__Plays like a Gallic version of a Sundance flick, complete with on-the-nose references ... and just enough offbeat touches to make it seem more deep than it actually is.__Mona Achache's first film follows two parallel storylines: one featuring a thoroughly insufferable little girl, the other a pleasingly grumpy middle-aged widow.__None
Gilded authentic locations and restrained performances provide an effective setting for Feret's theory about Nannerl's talent being stifled by conventions.____A meandering but transporting journey, which offers glimpses of a world as resplendent as it is stifling.__The music, of course, resonates. And so does this exquisite heartbreaker of a story.__An alternately rapturous and frustrating experience.__This is a sad story in rich surroundings that makes you wonder how many women of genius were left behind.__A melancholy but utterly beautiful film.__Nannerl is an intelligent and appealing girl who wages a dignified struggle against what turns out to be insurmountable barriers.__There's potentially an interesting story here, of ambition thwarted and talent denied, but Feret's movie misses it.__The movie is an uncommonly knowledgeable portrait of the way musical gifts could lift people of ordinary backgrounds into high circles.__As speculative storytelling goes, Mozart's Sister is ingenious but as moviemaking it's plodding.__Most memorable is the intriguing peek at frustrations that might have beset the real Nannerl, whose life was defined as much by sacrifice as by art.__The object isn't to stir you into what-if feminist outrage so much as to let a culturally magnificent era's societal inequalities act as a dissonant countermelody to a famous artist's biography.__The cast is excellent, be they relatives of the director or not. And the music, though not by a Mozart, is beautiful.__Feret paints a speculative, intimate portrait of a family bound by love, genius and ambition and almost undone by the same.__Feret's strategy involves rigorous restraint. His film is understated, even underlit. Instead of presenting us with forceful performances, he seduces us with subtle ones and allows us the sensation of discovery.__Gorgeous, with candlelit shots looking like old master paintings - a fine match for music that takes your breath away.__The story of the other prodigy named Mozart is brought to life with insight and a deft blend of historical fact and fiction.__Feret's film looks lovely, is acted well, and successfully humanizes famous folk from long ago.__Goes to great pains to reiterate how the era's misogyny robbed us of an extraordinary talent.
Sick but fun.__Gore hounds will appreciate Hobo with a Shotgun, but it is so wan that even squeamish viewers will shrug it off with a yawn.__The movie just blows chunks.__It's all in good fun and sometimes a little clever; "Hobo" shoots low and scores an explosive spray of guts, if not glory.__A merrily blood-soaked homage to the vigilante action movies of the 1970s and early 1980s, "Hobo'' is a good idea in theory that's brought down by the banality of its practice.__"Hobo" breathes new life into the demented realm of grindhouse cinema - a world that had grown pretty stale to this point.__Even connoisseurs of the genre (and I confess, I'm not one) will find the cheesy chopfests and gratuitous gore less than exciting as one urban prosthetics-strewn bloodbath begets the next.__What really puts this over-the-top extravaganza over the top is Hauer's ferocious and oddly sincere performance.__Will leave most viewers bored and uneasy, especially in scenes like the burning alive of a busful of young children.__Japan's Takashi Miike has the formula down pat, but Eisener has no idea how to give violence a touch of class.__What's not to like?__The closest thing the film gets to a message? "When life gives you razor blades, you make a baseball bat covered in razor blades." Sounds like a quote for a Successories poster in hell.__It's a hyper-violent, self-conscious throwback, with the sickly plastic aroma of a tape that's been gathering dust in the corner of a video store since 1984.__A hobo hops off a freight train in a nameless North American Gomorrah run by a sadistic crime king. Then said hobo cleans up the place by shooting buckets full of guts.__The sight of Hauer going postal with a double-barreled blaster is about on par with Liam Neeson mowing down Albanian sex traffickers in Taken-in other words...kerfawesome!__Quite the most appalling piece of junk I have seen lately, Hobo With a Shotgun just lies there like an autopsy.__The setup could also be read as an allegory of/justification for Dubya's invasion of Iraq (think about it), but that presumes more of an engagement with the non-cinematic world than Hobo ever really displays.__Does this cinematic jeu d'esprit ever gobsmack your eyes and nerve endings.__There's something appealing about the movie's unpretentious carnival of carnage, although I could have done without the flamethrower assault on a school bus to raise the stakes.__If, on the other hand, you appreciate a droll and savvy satire of the melodramatic excesses of seventies vigilante thrillers from a filmmaker who clearly knows his stuff, then get in the ticket line.
Operates as both an examination of the dominating media mentality at the time and an embodiment of it, no less keen on delving into the juicy details now as tabloid rags were then.__This is a lighter, less significant work than his 'Standard Operating Procedure' or 'The Fog of War', but it's engrossing and pleasingly slippery with the facts.____Errol Morris is a genius, a gifted documentarian who has made better movies than "Tabloid," but none so entertaining.__"Tabloid" is tantalizing, but like yesterday's headlines, it's a fleeting flirtation.__Though the events Tabloid recounts took place in the pre-digital age, the film also functions as a kind of prehistory of modern celebrity culture and tabloid journalism.__Morris's subject is sexual fantasy and a particular kind of American stupidity-the ability to substitute self-justification for self-knowledge. His tone is merry.__It is quite simply one of the craziest stories ever told, made all the crazier by the fact that it's true. Or at least some version of it is true.__Tabloid, Errol Morris' latest wild and woolly portrait of human self-delusion, is a scandal-sheet dream come to life.__The movie is guilty of condescending toward its subjects, though most of them appear to be having a fabulous time telling tales.__A tale of obsession and abduction, self-delusion and sexual confusion, Errol Morris' Tabloid stands as an almost giddy affirmation of the old cliche: Truth is stranger than fiction.__The viewer is left with no clear indication of what really happened, but with a vibrant portrait of a compelling character. That's what Morris is after.__Morris adds to the hilarity with his signature device of superimposing key words onscreen in giant type; the movie is a welcome reminder that he got his start immortalizing American oddballs.__Morris is clearly fascinated by her mega eccentricities and lets her go on at great length telling her side of the story.__Tabloid spins a heck of a yarn, while implicitly warning viewers not to be so entertained that they believe every gamy detail.__McKinney, a born performer, is in her glory as she spins her version of the affair.__Morris realizes he has a genuine character in McKinney, and gives her the spotlight.__For fans of Morris's work, which often grapples with the nature of truth and memory, it's a must-see film.__It's all compelling, in the way reading trashy gossip usually is. But without any new perspectives, what's the point?__"Tabloid" shows that an oddball lead character and a smirky style do not necessarily add up to a complete movie.
Lest you think that you've already seen every possible variation on the outsider-nerd story, Terri keeps plenty of surprises up its pit-stained sleeves.____Jacob Wysocki infuses his performance in the title role with precisely that same duality, turning Terri into an oversized portrait of adolescence -- so naive yet so wise, strangely believable and believably strange.__Its charms feel somewhat calculated, but this reflective tale of outsider solitude has enough humor and poignancy to win admirers.__A sweet and subtle comedy about the awkwardness of adolescence.__Terri may be strange, but it's a good, heartfelt strange that resonates long after the film ends.__[An] emotionally acute indie comedy by Azazel Jacobs.__Like its title character, an obese high-school misfit who wears pajamas to school because they're comfortable, Terri grows on you.__"Terri" is almost an anti-teen-coming-of-age teen-coming-of-age movie. And it's terrific.__Jacobs deftly handles the story's many moods, painting a picture of youth as a crazy, tragicomic time when even a wounded caregiver can make a world of difference.__"Terri" is a challenging but rewarding throwback to a time when independent films weren't just stepping stones on the road to Hollywood.__Jacobs and talented cinematographer Tobias Datum once again do a deft job conveying the texture of a home, this time the unkempt, jammed warren Terri shares with his Uncle James.__Much of the movie's success rests on the ample shoulders of Jacob Wysocki, who finds a sweet guileless spot as the title character.__A hit-and-miss affair with some scenes and relationships ringing true and others drowning in a deep pool of artifice.__Wysocki is a genuine talent, as is Jacobs, but the subject of "Terri" remains a pleasant blur.__Movies about high school misfits are common; this is an uncommon one.__"Terri" turns out to be a small masterpiece of misdirection, a winsome, utterly unpredictable portrait of adolescence that flawlessly captures its cruelty and sweetness.__If you've sworn off movies about adolescent misfits, I don't blame you, but make an exception for "Terri."__"Terri" sounds like a very sad film, and indeed it is; made more poignant by the quiet honesty of Wysocki's performance. But it's a wise film as well, populated by characters who seem utterly real.__Can you stand one more quirky, low-budget independent movie about a high school castaway? If it's from Azazel Jacobs, maybe you should.
__While its questions of affirmative action and charter schools could theoretically resonate with American auds, the pic's corny theatrics, talky, preachy approach and taxing 164-minute running time will not translate.__Subtle it ain't and subtle it needn't be. It is, though, mostly involving (if Bollywood long, at 2 hours 45 minutes) and even occasionally stirring.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A robust and amusing reminder of how Hollywood's tills are topped up by third-party brands and what they get - and we lose - in return.__Morgan Spurlock has sold his soul to help save yours.__Spurlock, the affable activist behind "Super Size Me," aims a not particularly harsh spotlight on product placement in his new documentary.__The problem is that the film, despite an attempt to examine the intellectual pollution of pervasive marketing, can't help coming off as one big smirk.__Few could pull off this fan dance as well as Spurlock, who manages to be both the laughing and crying clowns at the same time.__Forget about "greatest." But this could be the most self-referential movie ever: literally a 90-minute narrative about its own creation.__"Pom Wonderful Presents the Greatest Movie Ever Sold" sounds like an ingenious ploy, using the sponsors' own rope to hang them. Alas, the film never gets its lasso knotted.__Funny, informative, and at times outrageously cheeky.__Leaves you wishing there had been more journalistic exploration of the subject and less self-promotion.__The nonstop onslaught of product placements in our lives is, alas, a given. The only novelty here is that Spurlock has hauled the corporate marketeers into an indie movie arena supposedly too pure for such temptations.__Always the smooth showman, Spurlock avoids answering his own question: Is he selling out or buying in?__Engaging as Spurlock can be, too much of the movie is just scene after scene of him meeting with high-priced consultants to talk about "brand identity" and other euphemisms for shallow sloganeering.__An exuberant documentary that demonstrates the all-pervasive influence of modern advertising by satiric example, and with great ingenuity...__Like the best ad man, he makes his point by making us laugh.__Like "Super Size Me," the new "documentary" is heavy on Spurlock-centric humor and very light on actual information.__Only the extremely naive will be shocked, shocked by director Morgan Spurlock's dissection of product placement in movies.__There's nothing surprising in what Spurlock uncovers, but it illustrates that everything we knew - or at least suspected - about the marriage between advertising and cinema is accurate.__[Spurlock's] affable, regular-guy shtick works well here, and he scatters the movie with such gleeful ads for his sponsors' products that, if his documentary work ever dries up, his next career choice is obvious.__With "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold" Spurlock creates a good time along with some surprisingly salient observations as he tries to keep his balance on this very slippery slope.__Spurlock's clever, good-natured style clinches the deal. It's hard to imagine anyone else wooing sponsors to finance a savaging of their practices.
Gripping.__A gorgeous looking film filled with the sort of footage one can only get with patience and persistence.__Many of the sequences are intense, like those in which the lioness refines its hunting strategies in unfamiliar territory. But they're undercut by Jeremy Irons's sonorous narration.__Wrenching and wondrous, Dereck and Beverly Joubert's documentary The Last Lions is not a tale for the faint-hearted.__While "The Last Lions" lacks the visceral excitement of some other survival dramas, it has anthropomorphic heart to spare.__No matter how you feel about real-life drama being shaped and enhanced in the editing room, this is wildlife storytelling at its formidable finest.__It's all very melodramatic, but the Jouberts accompany this story with incredible visuals, with an exceptional level of access.__An astonishing visual experience and at times almost profoundly suspenseful.__A great way to go on a safari without ever leaving the multiplex.__One of the most urgent and certainly among the most beautifully shot documentaries to hit the big screen in recent memory__One of the most urgent and certainly among the most beautifully shot documentaries to hit the big screen in recent memory.__While jaw-dropping footage of the animals of the African bush is a remarkable aspect of "The Last Lions," more impressive still is the strong narrative thread that runs through the nature documentary.__Portentous narration by Jeremy Irons tries to fill up the dead spots, but the script is too fond of feline mind reading and philosophizing about the cruel grandeur of it all.__One thing is certain about Dereck Joubert's documentary account of Africa's dwindling lion population. The cinematography-by the writer-director-is seldom less than stunning.__All those years of filming have given the Jouberts a ringside seat on the lives of the lions they've observed, but the effort of squeezing all that footage into an 88-minute film that nominally covers roughly a year's time has had its consequences.__The footage, by Dereck and Beverly Joubert, is stunning.__This evocative National Geographic production proves to be both an inquisitive nature documentary and an activist call to arms.__Doubling as cinematographer, Dereck Joubert skillfully integrates slow-motion and creates a rich sense of space with godlike long shots.__There's real grrrrrrl power in this haunting portrait of an African lioness.__None
We are so held by the film's impact that its ending, surprise or not, is like a bonus.__Endearingly quirky, just this side of precious, but so warm and deftly executed that you go along with it.__"Le Havre" is a passing fancy of a film, but it passes quite nicely indeed.__'Tis the season, so the saying goes. And when it comes to Aki Kaurismaki, it holds true. The Finnish writer-director arrives bearing a gift wrapped in a contemporary immigration fable.__If the bummers and ambiguity of some of this season's movies are getting you down - or, hey, just the bummers and ambiguities of life - make your way to Le Havre. You won't be sorry.__The Finnish director's sense of humor is dry and dark as pitch, as he consistently finds moments of absurdity in the midst of strife and tragedy.__You almost become a citizen of Le Havre, watching this film and rejoicing at the end as two newfound, unexpected friends share a drink.__Kaurismaki wrote the script, I think, with secret credit from Mother Goose and some fabric softener.__"Le Havre" is a small bit of movie magic, a story that plays more as a fable even as it deals with something as topical as immigration.__The film is especially comforting if you love old movies, as Kaurismaki does.__Does Kaurismaki believe in his own fairy tale? The movie, a humble delight, suggests the answer is yes.__An exceeding droll comedy from Finnish master Aki Kaurismaki, whose dark worldview is balanced by a deep empathy for his blue-collar characters.__A slog of old-fashioned ideals and utter non-whimsy.__If the name Aki Kaurismaki doesn't mean anything to you, it should, and "Le Havre" may be the film to make it happen.__"Le Havre'' is warm-hearted and uplifting, without being schmaltzy or preachy. And, with its illegal-alien theme, it's dead-on timely.__No one looks at the world quite like Kaurismaki, and his deadpan sentimentality is worth discovery. This is a good place to start.__A contemporary fable set in a place constructed from blocks of French cinematic history, Le Havre is one of Aki Kaurismaki's warmest, most engaging films.__"Le Havre" stands on its own fragile but considerable merits.__A stylized and sentimental fairy tale about the way the world might be, grounded in a frank recognition of the way it is.__Le Havre is utopian precisely because it shows everything as it is not.
____Not a crowd-pleaser by any measure, but a mature, bold and recklessly inquisitive film, however unpleasant it is to consume in the moment.__Miranda July may be a bit too weird for her own good. On the other hand, it is a glorious weird.__Provides plenty of material for July junkies as well as July detractors.__What a strange, trippy, touching movie The Future is.__July is a provocative and honorably independent filmmaker, but given the meager rewards of investing our time, "The Future" wasn't worth the wait.__At times - not all the time, just enough to notice - July gets it backward.__Miranda July's second feature is beguiling, quietly funny and finally very sad in a way that sneaks up on you before becoming clear as the Los Angeles skies beneath which it's set.__Not everything about "The Future" works. But most of it does, in a quietly powerful way.__The Future, July's coy and precious new film, is just oddball enough to be interesting, if not good.__The actors are quite engaging, in their mopey way.__July likes her rhythms to shuffle, her beats to go long. She is the master of sideways portent - the small act with big ramifications.__The notion that both this movie and "Battle: Los Angeles" could come out of the same place, in the same year, is a startling tribute to the city.__A talking cat and moon and a restless T-shirt distract from the story, creating what July intends as interesting textures but instead come across as a form of vandalism.__It can definitely grate on your nerves but, at best, it also gets into your mind, and sticks fast.__At some point, we knew, this sui generis storyteller would return and grace us with another dose of her delightfully peculiar worldview. Now that The Future has become the present, July doesn't disappoint.__Overly precious poetic examination of a couple's eccentric attempts to evolve their lives will appeal to a rarified few.__This is worth seeing, but only if you think you can tolerate the precious voice-over narration from the couple's wounded cat, delivered by July in a high, scratchy voice.__With wit and unsettling strangeness, "The Future" takes a sitcom premise - two skittish 35-year-olds adopting a sick and injured cat in order to tiptoe into the responsibilities of adulthood - and gives it a radical, otherworldly twist.
Unless your idea of a good joke is a golf ball thwacked into an unsuspecting crotch or the old frying-pan-in-the-kisser gag, you probably won't like this movie.__The film is amiably silly, gaudy and even pleasantly diverting for the non-Hindi-speaking viewer who realizes that the verbal gags that elicited laughter in the original language tend to elude translation via English subtitles.____None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Writer-director Martin Koolhoven hits just the right balance of domesticity and oppression here, setting up the film's tense second half with sweet early touches of naivete.__It's got a grown-up artfulness, but "Winter in Wartime" could become a lot of boys' favorite movie.__What makes "Winter" really special is its complex exploration of the theme of heroism.__Director Martin Koolhoven's film about one boy's struggle to make sense of the absurd - of the inhumanity of war and its effects on everyone around him.__Winter in Wartime benefits from top-notch production values and a sturdy performance from its young lead, Martijn Lakemeier.__If you've seen one slow-motion "Noooooooo!" as a firing squad lets loose, you've seen 'em all.__There's the potential for rich psychological head games here, and "Winter in Wartime'' flirts with them before giving itself over to contrivances.__It's an affecting, if somewhat flavorless, journey.__View the Second World War through a child's eyes and the result isn't hard to predict: a loss-of-innocence tale. Winter in Wartime is the boilerplate version, with the already dramatic facts of the era ramped up to melodramatic levels.__Perhaps best suited to young teens, who will get a peer's view of life during wartime that will make them question what they would do, were they to face similar circumstances.__Koolhoven is able to strip away both visually and mentally our idealized cinematic notions of how the resistance fighters lived. It's a lonely existence. It's stark and it's scary. And it makes for a compelling movie.__The film is stirring and visually beautiful but not quite interesting enough, morally or formally, to be first-rate.__A few of the performances are fine. But this is still a story we've heard before. Only this time, as it's being told, someone's playing his favorite records far too loud.__"Winter in Wartime" may serve as a useful way to introduce teens to what World War II in Europe was like.__The movie immerses you in the consciousness of a restless boy desperate for initiation into the rest of his life.__Koolhoven elicits strong performances in the handsomely photographed feature but fails to sustain tension, creating a work that's smooth and reassuring, never truly gripping.__Carefully written, sensitively directed and beautifully acted...__Koolhoven's philosophical probing of human limitation among the good guys is all but overwhelmed by his commercial instincts and undeniable skill at juggling realism with genre.__Dutch helmer Martin Koolhoven finds the perfect blend of classical cinema and arthouse sensitivities.__Young Lakemeier's performance is poignant without ever falling into sentimentality.
__Love Crime may not have much to do with love, but the crimes are meanly delicious.__The movie veers off in a different direction about two-thirds of the way through; the shift is initially jarring but eventually rewarding.__Would anyone really perpetrate a scheme as complicated and risky as Isabelle's? Not likely - but that's why we go to the movies.__This is a ridiculous movie - a thriller so indifferent to suspense, so above mystery that one character literally stabs another in the front.__Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Especially one in a power suit, who knows how to work a room.__On the one hand, you have to admire such obsessive mise en scene; on the other, there's something wrong with a suspense film when the sets are more interesting than the characters.__Corneau, a veteran of police procedurals and workplace dramas, skillfully plays out the scenarios of gamesmanship and humiliation, backstabbing and catfighting.__The craftsmanship lifts this genre exercise above the routine.__The two lead performances make it work, even if the plot eventually seems devious for its own sake.__It's all tease in the first half, and all implausibilities in the second. Still, Thomas is always worth watching, in French or in English, whether her mood be chilly or tropical.__I'm already looking for an excuse to see it again.__The two-handed duet at the center of Love Crime radiates, but the parade of easily parodied men who stomp in and out of their corporate offices just seem like script rejects from Mad Men.__It is a bit of dark fun before it turns preposterous and unsatisfying, piffle dressed up in steely sang-froid.__A super-cool thriller in the style of Alfred Hitchcock and Claude Chabrol.__More cold fish than cold-blooded, director Alain Correau keeps his movie buttoned up and predictable.__Without a plausible backdrop, all that's left of Love Crime are the power games between two duplicitous women and the serpentine plotting that results. And even that, under the slightest scrutiny, frays like a thin layer of tissue paper.__A delicious thriller that gets under the skin a la "All About Eve," albeit with a twist: The craft here is still theater, but of the workplace rather than the stage.__It is interesting and ingenious, even if some of the kinky, queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away.__While Corneau delivers a slick, well-acted piece with a surprising mid-movie twist, Love Crime is too thin and too on-point to deliver the jolt he and co-screenwriter Nathalie Carter most likely intended.
The need to cram in facts and events makes 'Machine Gun Preacher' feel too much like one large and needlessly glossy montage sequence.__In telling a true story, ambiguity can be an asset; but instead of mapping a middle course, director Marc Foster veers between two kinds of falsehoods.__The cliches fly like so many spent bullet casings...__What looks on the surface to be yet another inspiring story of one man's salvation turns out to be instead both an examination of modern atrocity and a rethinking of the burden/beauty of belief.__Why is it that uplifting movies based on true stories often feel so untrue and fall so flat?__What a surprise. Its grindhouse title notwithstanding, "Machine Gun Preacher" is a genuine drama.__The Lord may work in mysterious ways, but "Machine Gun Preacher" is downright confounding.__Somewhere in the middle of this 127-minute film, the energy drops out, and Forster never quite gets it back.__Sam's duality ought to make for some interesting storytelling and a fascinating, conflicted character. But Forster and Butler overplay that conflict, turning "Preacher" into a portrait of goodwill gone amok.__"Machine Gun Preacher'' is crude and ham-handed from its ridiculous title on down, but it still gets to some interesting places.__Childers' deeds are presented simply as heroic. By the end of Machine Gun Preacher, its title character has become a cartoon.__If nothing else, Machine Gun Preacher drives home the inhumanity of the situation far better than any two-minute evening news segment can.__There's more machine gunning than preaching, but what did you expect?__Butler acts the role within an inch of its life.__"Machine Gun Preacher" gives blood-soaked missionary work a bad name.__"Machine Gun Preacher" is a combination of uplift and gritty violence, and the parts don't fit.__It's probably Gerard Butler's best and most complete performance to date in one of the more inspirational stories of the year.__Even the Sudanese orphans, whose plight is, after all, the film's reason for being, are presented as a grievous backdrop to Childers's calisthenics. They are poster-art children, framed to elicit our maximum sympathy.__The filmmakers may have started with a real story here. But all they've come up with is a real chore.__Far too high-and-mighty to truly be moving.
__Deep in the swampy hearts and minds of some filmmakers, embarrassing stereotypes still fester, gathering moss and slime.__Doesn't throw in the kind of wit that can turn a formulaic creature feature into a pleasant diversion along the lines of "Lake Placid."__There is a perverse enjoyment to be had from something this cheesy, although not enough of one that I can recommend sitting through it.__It is in no way a great movie. But it is a great reminder of what used to be so much fun about bad movies.__With dependably creepy character actor Sid Haig to goose things along as leader of the locals, "Creature" is delightfully dopey.__May have been intended as a homage of sorts to Jaws but it comes across as more like a ripoff of a film that is far, far, far out of its league.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Smug and unconvincing, this 2008 period drama from the Netherlands is the sort of movie that defines an era solely by its prejudices, on the implicit assumption that we'll applaud the central characters for their modern attitudes.__This very pretty melodrama is a rather ordinary entry.__Aside from its period New Zealand setting, there is little to distinguish Bride Flight from something you might watch briefly on Lifetime, then change the channel.__The events in the plot are the stuff of soap opera, but the movie treats it seriously, and the acting is convincing enough that we forgive the story and begin to care about the characters.__Lovely scenery and historical context elevate the sentimental story lines above the soap opera domain.__A tearjerking romance that belongs to another era, when female moviegoers wanted to be transported, not grounded in grim realities.__For anyone who shrugs at today's movies and thinks "they don't make 'em like they used to," here's a classy, good-looking chick flick in the old-school tradition.__"Bride Flight'' is the sort of old-fashioned women's picture they stopped making around the time Christina Crawford had to put away the wire hangers.__One should never discount the appeal of pretty people in pretty places.__It does everything but hand viewers a glass of white wine, light candles and draw them a bath.__It's compelling in a middling miniseries kind of way -- expansive but not terribly deep.__This Dutch melodrama compels despite its formulaic elements.__What's truly moving here are the characters, who all feel real enough to make you want to shout an occasional warning, like a fan in a horror movie. Except this time it's not "Don't go in the basement!" but "Don't marry him!"__Sombogaart approaches his soapy subject with just enough restraint. As a result, you can convince yourself it's a highbrow arthouse film even as you're swooning and sniffling over so many tangled love stories.__The kind of lush, epic romantic weepie that Hollywood used to deliver on a regular basis for packed matinees at Radio City Music Hall.__The weepy story at the heart of "Bride Flight" is trumped by its sumptuous depiction of New Zealand in the 1950s and '60s. This lushness has the effect of a powerful fabric softener added to the wash.__Bride Flight gives a panoramic sweep of lives as they're lived, as there is a lot of beauty in it.__The subtitles and period setting conjure a smattering of respectability, but in essence, this is arthouse pap, particularly for older audiences, turning the past into a concatenation of worn-out tropes that comforts as it distorts.__Bride Flight is the most lavishly entertaining Dutch film since Paul Verhoeven's fabulous The Black Book.__A sometimes silly but enjoyable experience.
Sexy, provocative, engrossing and occasionally ornery, it should appeal to anyone whose curiosity about someone new has provoked them to question their own identity.__Cullen and New are British stage actors with little background in film. Haigh's only previous film was a documentary. Perhaps because they don't feel bound by a set of rules, they've created one of the year's most enjoyable surprises.__It's a definitive example of naturalistic moviemaking -- you feel you're breathing the air that the characters are breathing.__Its final moments offer a vision of what a contemporary romance can achieve: an appreciative gasp of truth, a wet-eyed hope for more.__One of the truest, most beautiful movies ever made about two strangers.__If you've ever met someone who changed your life in the space of days, you'll relate to something in this movie.__The organ that "Weekend" is most concerned with isn't the one you might think, but the human heart.__In just a short period of time, a weekend hookup tests the boundaries each man has set for himself.__If this lovely movie proffers a thesis or a moral, it's a simple one. A more open, fully integrated and passionate life feeds the soul no less than air and water. Or coffee the morning after.__The bland sentimentality and dull attitudinizing turn the movie into an empty frame of good intentions.__A moving and empathetic look at how relationships develop, at how people fall in love and what that does and doesn't do to their lives.__It's about love's essence, and the pain of its absence.__Writer-director Andrew Haigh, who's made several short films and one other feature while holding down big-studio editing gigs, allows the characters and their ideas to develop naturally.__This is a smart, sensitive, perceptive film, with actors well suited to the dialogue. It underlines the difficulty of making connections outside our individual boxes of time and space.__An achingly tender chamber piece from first-time director Andrew Haigh.__hile the credible script and naturalistic acting deserve praise, there's even a thrill in seeing romantic cliches -- you'll spot them all -- embraced anew.__Haigh avoids exploitation and cheap thrills in favor of a mature, incisive examination of relationships.__It is about the paradoxes and puzzlements of gay identity in a post-identity-politics era, and also about the enduring mystery of sexual attraction and its consequences.__Its small scale allows for detailed looks at two men who are likeable and flawed, and who connect on a level neither expected -- nor in one case, was even looking for.__Boy meets boy in this low-budget, acutely observed relationship drama.
Crowe has assembled some top-drawer ephemera -- old show posters, home movies, and candid backstage footage -- but he overestimates his audience's patience for present-day talking-head interviews.__With its intimacy and (this can't be emphasized enough) fantastic sound, Pearl Jam Twenty is like two hours spent rediscovering the band through excellent headphones.__If only it was about something other than rockers almost irked they got famous.__In a better film, Crowe would have played journalist instead of fan boy.__By the time "Pearl Jam Twenty" is over we can't help but be impressed by the kind of personal and professional integrity that has kept the band honest and allowed them to endure and prosper.__While the movie may not have the insight of D. A. Pennebaker's "Don't Look Back" or even Phil Joanou's U2 travelogue, "Rattle and Hum," Pearl Jam devotees will not go home musically unnourished.__If Pearl Jam Twenty has its share of hyperbole, it's leavened with humor, self-deprecating commentary, and a deep-pockets budget's worth of great clips.__What makes Pearl Jam Twenty a little better than the average fan-friendly documentary is that Crowe focuses on the more significant parts of the Pearl Jam story.__Cameron Crowe's chronicle of the Seattle grunge quintet's first two decades is undeniably thorough - even offshoot Temple of the Dog gets the spotlight - but it's also weirdly self-aggrandizing.__Perhaps Pearl Jam's arc too closely resembles Crowe's own, and he can't see what's so uniquely poignant about dimmed but enduring stars.__Any enterprise like this is inherently self-congratulatory, but the film is best considered from Crowe's perspective: that of a fan.__PJ is far from the key band of its moment (and where's that movie?), resulting in a doc that feels padded.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
That rare teen comedy where the kids aren't gorgeous, the hero isn't heroic and the object of desire has a lot of reasons why she isn't necessarily desirable.__The result is a small, delicate comedy that depends on a continuity of tone that it pulls off. Oliver may not live happily ever after; but he manages to live happily enough here, and that's just fine.__An exercise in briny Welsh Weltzschmerz that tracks the inner and outer worlds of a confused teenage boy.__In its own right, "Submarine" is one of the best movies of the year.__"Submarine'' has its own specific miseries and darkly funny vibe. It makes quirkiness briefly seem like a good thing again.__For an unreliable narrator, Oliver's story is reliably entertaining.__The main problem with Submarine is that Oliver is not a likable protagonist.__Ayoade owes a debt to Wes Anderson, but the parents here are so beautifully written, and Hawkins and Taylor particularize them so well, that the movie manages to hold its own.__These things could have easily resulted in a mass outbreak of broad comedy, but the actors play their roles completely straight. In Submarine, you truly ache through the awkward moments -- even as you're laughing out loud.__There are no really profound insights in "Submarine" except this: That you'll never really know another person unless you're willing to take the plunge.__Ayoade is better at establishing a road map of what "Submarine" is supposed to be rather than pulling all its elements together cohesively.__I suggest you take a chance on "Submarine" and find out if its particular comic angst rings any bells, be you male or be you female, Welsh or American, 16 or 61.__It's a self-confident work for the first-time director, Richard Ayoade, whose purpose I think is to capture that delicate moment in some adolescent lives when idealism and trust lead to tentative experiments.__After an OK start, "Submarine" sinks beneath sloggy pacing and a general lack of originality.__It's a familiar story, yes - but we all have to chart our own way through it.__The setting is Wales during the mid-1980s, but the emotions and characters would be at home in any country in any year.__Ayoade has an evident gift for the kind of slightly offbeat comedy that's about the differences between a character's self-perception and the way the world sees him.__Ayoade is at his most inventive, and least derivative, in a goofy mode, but Submarine, for the most part, is not in his best range.__Submarine isn't a perfect film, but it's a terrific first one. Leaving the theater, you feel you've been taken in hand by a director of tremendous promise, and you can't wait to see what he does next.__A delicate and potent new British comedy.
__It is a peculiar conflation of history -- there really was an Empress Wu -- and pure cinematic fantasy.__By the end, with the running time pushing past the two-hour mark, it's reasonable to ask: Just who are these people?__Detective Dee is the action flick of the year, a two-hour epic that blows the Pirates of the Caribbean to the Bermuda Triangle.__"Dee" doesn't shoot for the gravitas of Zhang Yimou's "Hero." It doesn't approach that film's magnificent sensory impact, either, or the artistic romanticism that made "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" such a success here.__Three decades into his career, Tsui Hark stands as one of the movies' great entertainers, displaying a dancer's sense of rhythm and movement and manipulating physical space with an abandon worthy of Chuck Jones.__A colourful carnival of relentless action and artful images.__Is it possible for Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame to be any more riotously over-the-top than it is?__It's slambang in pacing, bald in exposition, and offers cast-of-hundreds spectacle.__A bewitching fantasy.__If nothing else, the film is colorful.__Chang Chia-lu's intricate script bristles with wit and suspense; the film from start to finish is a terrific entertainment.__All this is loads of fun, but after a while sensory overload sets in, dulling the mind. Even in a kung-fu flick, more isn't always better.__Director Tsui Hark sets expansive melodrama against flamboyant sets, and the all-star cast is up for even the most outlandish of Sammo Hung's action choreography.__Some of the action in "Detective Dee" is computer-generated hallucination, some is just good-old life-threatening stunt work, but it is almost always a thrill.__Witty but not campy, grand without being unduly somber, it is a crazy, almost-coherent riot of intrigue, color and kineticism anchored by the charisma of its cast.__We'd call it Crouching Tiger, Freakin' Masterpiece.__What makes Detective Dee worthy of Hark is that the action is always thematically justified, underscoring who our champion is.__The film becomes more deliriously nonsensical by the moment, which is part of its intermittent charms...__Magnificent and cheesy, the latest and most proudly absurd of Chinese historical spectaculars, Detective Dee is a cinematic comic book for people who are sick of the mode.
The content feels familiar, but the perspective is fresh.__Keshavarz, who was born in New York City and grew up in the U.S. and Iran, shows us how young people in Tehran get around the constrictive system...__We never doubt the sincerity of the emotions on display, or of the foretaste Circumstance provides of a society on the brink of radical change.__About a sexy, frank and politically contentious Iranian film, two things can be known for a certainty: (a) It sure wasn't made in Iran and (b) It won't be shown there either.__[The] film is too much a wounded love story to slide into polemic.__Both Boosheri and Kazemy are newcomers, but their spirited, tender performances -- from the eroticism to the shame and the flights of freedom -- feel completely, devastatingly real.__This impressive debut feature generates plenty of erotic heat, and Nikohl Boosheri, in her first screen role, gives a captivating performance as the sensually awakened heroine.__Offers an inside look at Iran in all its cultural complexity.__Keshavarz has cast mostly newcomers with surprisingly effective results, especially the gorgeous Kazemy, whose somber beauty and quiet focus give her character the gravitas she deserves.__Maryam Keshavarz has announced herself as a bold voice, albeit from exile, in the new Iranian cinema.__Despite its arty veneer and its ostensibly political edge, Circumstance seems more interested in titillation than revelation.__More interesting for its cultural views than for its insights into love, sex, family angst, and rebellious youth.__"Circumstance'' is a rhapsodic erotic romance that takes place in a cultural prison, and it pulses with a defiance that would be mischievous if it weren't so rip-roaringly angry.__The film wages an internal battle between its ripely sensual atmosphere and its often stilted pacing and plotting.__Unfortunately, it strays into unlikely melodrama and distracting eroticism.__The film doesn't feel weighed down with the burden of representation: It's too free-flowing for that, too plot-heavy, too stylish, too romantic, too hot.__A powerful debut film and a remarkable tale of oppression and liberation, and one that leaps right to the top of the unfortunately brief list of LGBT-themed films set in the Islamic world.__Iran's religious fundamentalists can't be pleased with "Circumstance," a bold denunciation of their country's intolerance, especially toward women.__Though some things feel familiar - Atafeh is wealthy, while Shireen is an orphan - Keshavarz's vision is clear and heartfelt, and everyone has an urgency in their eyes.__This is a movie about longing, desire, desperation and the abandonment of principle -- quite a collection of themes, all universal.
At a time when Indian officials are immersed in kickback scandals and violence against women remains endemic, No One Killed Jessica deserves to be seen -- and heard.__One of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in Indian legal history is dynamically dramatized.__A hybrid of fact and fiction, this Delhi-based thriller packs a punch no matter the label.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This haunting life story is an exquisite example of non-fiction filmmaking as full-bodied, emotionally complex drama.__Project Nim nimbly serves up a profoundly sad tale that raises as many thought-provoking questions as it answers.__This many-faceted time capsule sheds little light, but buried inside it are vexing questions and the still-beating heart of a special creature.__You end up fearing for the humans who contact him. At the same time, you feel his rage.__You're left with the impression that, despite not being able to grasp basic human grammar, perhaps Nim was unwittingly conditioned into understanding the concept of love.__For the second film in a row, Marsh has created a movie we can't keep our eyes off.__Marsh ... masterfully spins a harrowing tale of human arrogance that eventually gives way to cruelty bordering on the pathological.__Nim is as unforgettable as the treatment of him is unspeakable.__Like the experiment itself, "Project Nim" morphs from something inspiring and often humorous to a pointed and disturbing portrait of arrogance run amok. Greed and glory end up overriding decency and altruism, and it's heartbreaking to watch.__After watching "Project Nim," a distressing portrait of a misguided 1970s language experiment, you'll be glad you're not a chimp in a cage. But you might want to revoke your membership in the human race.__What makes this film especially engrossing is that what happened between that chimp and the humans with whom he spent his life in intimate contact turns out to be only half the story that Marsh, who directed the electrifying "Man on Wire," has to tell.__Marsh tells this story clearly and sympathetically, and he has the backlog of film and the witnesses to do so.__At times hilarious but ultimately heartbreaking, "Project Nim" is a great chronicle of the 1970s and all the nutty ideas that implies; academia in particular comes in for a hard reckoning.__The film as a whole maintains a precarious but rewarding balance between multi-generational soap opera and simplistic animal-rights agitprop.__For a film where so many people seem, in varying degrees, culpable, Marsh indulges in very little finger-pointing. He doesn't need to. The indignities are hiding in plain sight.__Marsh never speaks on or off camera, but his editing of the testimony makes clear his belief that in trying to make Nim more human, his teachers made themselves less so.__It's a gripping, unsentimental, at times unbearably sad real-life drama about an animal torn from his own world and stranded in the human one.__A documentary detailing man's inhumanity to beast, "Project Nim" ends up going past that to ask a deeper, disturbing question: Just who is the man, and who is the beast?__If only this were a media-fueled tall tale and not one poor creature's lifelong nightmare.__A darkly hilarious social portrait of the bizarre alternate universe of 1970s academia and an extraordinary biography of a non-human individual, on whom all sorts of human desires and ideologies were projected.

A solitary long-distance traveler with prehistoric cachet, the loggerhead turtle makes a compelling subject for a nature film, as the spectacularly shot, aptly named Turtle: The Incredible Journey demonstrates, if at times too feverishly.__A smartly shot sea documentary delivers its ecological message but does suffer from an overly dramatic narration.__Nick Stringer's documentary about the 25-year migratory cycle of loggerhead turtles has some remarkable underwater footage.__Without a disclaimer that explains what's real and not, how can viewers, including those who may already be skeptical about claims of environmental crises, trust that the whole thing hasn't been made up?__Visually resplendent.__It's a bit long to be as kid friendly as this educational and visually striking film is meant to be. But it will give you a renewed appreciation for who these creatures are...__Turtle still has cinematographer Rory McGuinness's remarkable visuals in its favor, though, and reveals how even innocuous human activites curtail the loggerheads' centuries-in-the-making migration with refreshing subtlty.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Happily, Hesher never lays things out too clearly. Just as you never know where he came from, it's hard to grasp where he's going, or even what he's doing in the moment. But you know he fits somewhere. And that's satisfaction enough.__Gordon-Levitt is a sly and inventive actor, and it can be genuinely fun to watch him having so much fun. But this character wears out his welcome fast.__Rather than a character rooted in some sort of reality -- social, satirical, psychological, take your pick -- Hesher is an abstract notion animated by false energy.__Bad role models sometimes make the most interesting movie characters.__Unlike many films that hope to be called black comedy, it does not skimp on either the black or the comedy.__When the blessed credits finally roll, the first thing Susser shows us is Hesher's tattoo of a raised middle finger. Backatcha, dude.__At a future date, when some grad student writes a thesis on 'Wild Men of the Subconscious in Popular Culture,' there will certainly be a special place for 'Hesher.' Just as long as it stays there and is never in front of my eyes again.__"Hesher" is about as awful as independent films get, a mix of ugliness and unearned sentiment, with a flat story, repellent and pathetic characters and dialogue that consists of lots of stammering and cursing.__Susser, who wrote the film with David Michod, has a kinetic filmmaking style and an impish, crash-and-burn sense of humor that keeps sentiment at bay long enough to let us appreciate the loose, uncomplicated performances...__As played by the spectacular Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Hesher is the id run rampant. Even when the script edges him into Hallmark sentiment, you can't take your eyes off him.__A grim little drama that seems to exist in order to give the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Natalie Portman a chance to look extra-scruffy.__[Gordon-Levitt gives] a fearsome and giddily unhinged performance in a movie that isn't entirely sure what to do with it.__"Hesher" assembles a group of characters who aren't sure why they're in the same movie together.__Not even Mr. Gordon-Levitt's unremittingly savage performance can begin to salvage such hokum.__What does he want? Where does he come from? Director Spencer Susser appears too intoxicated by the title character to risk peering beyond the enigmatic surface for fear of losing some of his mystery, as mystery is all Hesher has.__It's unflinching stuff, and might have worked if there were a reason for any of it. Levitt, Portman and Wilson work hard to infuse the film with some likeability.__Hesher has its genuinely affecting scenes, but too much of the time it feels false and shallow.__Writer-director Spencer Susser and cowriter David Michod generate fresh hells at a surreally rapid clip but cop out with an incongruously sentimental ending.__Joseph Gordon-Levitt is riveting as the title character, an ambiguous, intriguing mentor/menace.__Director Spencer Susser doesn't try to make Hesher anything other than a sociopath - a walking, profanity-spewing id - and to his credit, neither does Gordon-Levitt.
The director injects some showy images into the mix but, without a defined frame for Schnabel to paint in, "Miral" is an unholy mess.__What "Miral" lacks in performance art, Schnabel attempts to replace with design.__Miral has the pedigree, the attitude, the weighty subject matter. It's just not much of a movie.__How can you appeal to both sides when you tell only one side's story?__"Miral's" agenda doesn't play to Schnabel's strengths. His best work on film is bold-stroke portraiture, evoking complicated personalities and emotions with dynamic, dreamlike imagery.__It's a miniseries awkwardly stuffed in the body of a two-hour drama about the Palestinians' long struggle against the Israelis.__...is [Schnabel] being this indulgent because he can't fully engage the noncommittal material, or are we just noticing the indulgences more because the material's so noncommittal?__Combining narrative heavy-handedness with an airy disdain for the details of the situation, director Julian Schnabel gives us a one-sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in "Miral."__The last thing propaganda should do is make its audience work. "Miral" is a lot of work.__The film seeks to humanize a seemingly unwinnable conflict, and it succeeds at that. But stepping back sadly weakens its story as well as its politics.__Miral plays like an art project that took a wrong turn somewhere between Soho and Ramallah. It seems the Middle East is unstable ground not just for diplomats, but for aesthetes as well.__Like so many other well-intentioned movies about politically contentious issues, it is hobbled by its own sincerity and undone by a confused aesthetic agenda.__The film aspires to be epic, spanning 1947 to 1994, but the stories don't always cohere.__The lack of a compelling lead figure, combined with Schnabel's tentative approach to the material, casts the film's later stretches in the balmy glow of soap opera.__Schnabel seems cowed by his subject matter, and it doesn't help that Jebreal adapted her own book. There's no one to impose a shape on the film...__Schnabel's attempt at depicting this longtime, bloody friction from the Palestinian point of view -- and with a conciliatory tone -- is admirable; if only it had been more compelling.__At once open-eyed and myopic, skillful and meandering...__When Tom Waits starts croaking on the soundtrack, hipster exhaustion becomes crippling.__Miral is a very flat, fuddled movie, an at-odds-with-itself partisan work, its convictions diffused in a warm soak of style.__Schnabel's signature blend of splintered storytelling and sobering humanism feels misapplied to this sweeping multigenerational saga of four Arab women living under Israeli occupation.
While its situations are more complex and less ham-fisted than those in many inspirational stories of reaffirmed faith, Mooz-lum...suffers from one-note characterizations.__Sensitive performances smooth out the dramatic rough spots of this well-intentioned, racially-charged drama.__A potent feature debut for writer-director Qasim Basir, "Mooz-lum" attacks Islamist extremism while offering audiences a rare and illuminating depiction of life as a Muslim in America.__There's an undeniable potency to the blunt-instrument melodrama of Mooz-lum.__Solemn, unsubtle, and terminally self-conscious.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
True to the title, writer-director Lee Chang-dong is principally concerned with rendering emotions that seem inexpressible.__Those with an eye for reading between the lines can find layers of meaning.__A deceptively gentle tale with a tender ache at its center, as well as a performance from Yun Jung-hee that lingers long in the memory.__Anyone who starts a film going to poetry classes is eventually going to come up with a poem. The one Mija finally delivers will rip your heart to shreds.__Writer and director Chang-dong Lee's film is moving without ever stooping to melodrama; Yun is the main reason why.__"Poetry" is daring in the ways only quiet, unhurried but finally haunting films have the courage to be.__A Korean movie about an aging housemaid that turns out to be one of the best films of the year.__Lee is a gifted, thoughtful filmmaker, unafraid to tackle difficult subjects.__A captivating film, as observant and nuanced as a sonnet.__Now is the time to bestow on yourself the gift of one of the most, well, poetic films of 2010. And by "poetic," we mean rich with soulful pauses that are at once visual and aural and deeply observant of the dance of routine and quiet surprise.__About guilt and responsibility, about loss, about the terrible things human beings do, and the moments of serenity and spiritual succor to be gleaned from the natural world.__Sometimes you don't fully appreciate what a movie's doing to your heart until it's been shattered.__Mija, at the center, is perhaps determined to not fill her remaining memories with despair, and to avoid adding to the sum of the world's misery. Maybe it's as simple as that.__This is a small film. It is also a great one. "Great" is a word I don't use often.__[An] exquisite Korean drama by Secret Sunshine's Lee Chang-dong.__"Poetry," which rightfully won the best-screenplay prize at Cannes, never resorts to exploitation. Under Lee's guidence, it is a mature film for mature audiences.__Ms. Yun's performance [is] a tour de force of emotional complexity that builds through restraint and, like Mr. Lee's unadorned visual style, earns rather than demands your attention.__This is a movie about how in the throes of inspiration, phrases follow each other organically, leading the poet to places she didn't know she was headed when she began. But for Yun, that journey is terrifying, with only blackness ahead.__Yun is quite simply spectacular as a woman who holds steadfastly on to her dignity and empathy, even in the face of unspeakable tragedy.__Poetry is a perfectly paced and performed character study of a woman raising a child on her own who must contend with a heinous act of violence.
__It's funny how 'real life' sometimes conforms so closely to hackneyed patterns of screenwriting.__The First Grader is every bit as inspiring and heart-warming as you'd expect.__The filmmaking is ... uneven, filled with charming picture-postcard scenes of smiling children and African sunshine that seem crafted for a different film than one with moments of horrific flashbacks.__The story is uplifting in a predictably pro-education, antiwar, feel-good way, warmth and humor balancing the heavy moments.__Stow your cynicism and give this lesson in continuing education the response it deserves -- more than a polite clap, maybe even a sitting ovation.__It's a middle-of-the-road film.__You marvel all the more at Litondo's and Harris's performances, considering how much claptrap Ann Peacock's script requires them to put up with.__Strong performances and a stripped-down visual aesthetic help mitigate some of the movie's potential mawkishness.__Director Justin Chadwick filmed in Kenya, and his imagery, as well as the faces of the schoolchildren, and of Litondo, all of them nonactors, is far more expressive than the formulaic script.__Too bad the script is predictable at every turn.__Chadwick shows admirable restraint bringing this true story to the screen, and Litando does much with glimmers of emotion and wells of dignity.__A tearful, joyful, imperfect, yet nearly irresistible ode to the human spirit.__Fascinating and frustrating in almost equal measure.__The First Grader offers a tumultuous but uplifting journey...__The First Grader plays more like a teaching tool than a dynamic drama.__A lot of history gets horned into this undeniably inspirational parable, though slick execution and simplistic storytelling make it a lesson suitable only for easily impressed elementary-school students.__Although the arc of the story might be familiar, the setting and characters are fresh.__None__None
We almost feel that we ourselves have accomplished something just by being around while Bruegel doodled.__"The Mill and the Cross" might not be perfect, but it's stimulating, hypnotic and, in its unique way, exciting.__The Mill and the Cross may thrill you. But be prepared for a fight. Twenty minutes in, your companion may throw up his or her arms and complain, "This is like watching a painting dry."__The Mill & the Cross invites us to inhabit a work of art along with the mind of the man who made it and to be enthralled by the images shared in vivid tableaux by visionary Polish director Lech Majewski.__What hangs before us is so striking, beautiful, strange, vast, horrifying, ethereal, lifelike - so alive - that we're desperate to enter the other side of the canvas, to be inside the painting.__If you see no more than the opening shots, you will never forget them.__Majewski's film is a captivating exercise that will interest fans of art, not to mention arthouse cinema.__"The Mill and the Cross" is an art-history lesson and a spiritual exercise disguised as a movie.__Despite a too slow pace for my own tastes, Hauer helps move the film along by being captivating even in just a few scenes.__As art history, the movie is splendid. As a film, it is didactic and photogenic - but not cinematic.__Computer-generated imagery is often used to simulate the future in motion pictures, but the ravishing The Mill and the Cross uses it to replicate the past.__While it's far from easy going, The Mill And The Cross is worth attempting for its stunning visuals alone.__Majewski's film is a dazzling master class in visual composition.__No description can do justice to "The Mill and the Cross," which must be seen to be fully appreciated.__An extraordinary example of both art-historical interpretation and CGI as passport to unknown lands, The Mill and the Cross... is a moving-image tribute to the still image, with its ability to "wrestle the senseless moment to the ground."__In this lush and hypnotic examination of a painter's work and the times in which he lived, Mr. Majewski presents an extended contemplation of the creative process itself.__This attempt to explore and dramatize a masterpiece of 16th-century art falls flat.__Neither conventional costume drama nor abstract objet d'art, this visually ravishing, surprisingly beguiling gamble won't fit any standard arthouse niche.__None__None
Constance Marks's film is a simple cut-and-paste job, drawing on new interviews and archive, but what it lacks in refinement it makes up for in infectious warmth.__[Clash is] portrayed as a mild-mannered, kind, giving, supremely talented soul, with a deep love for the puppet he animates and the children who love him.__Despite an exhaustive series of interviews with famous puppeteers and a few celebs (among them Whoopi Goldberg, who also narrates), it's a documentary that feels a bit tedious by journey's end.__Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey" is the story of a young man who knew what he wanted to do and did it, who made his dreams real. This may be the most truly American movie in memory.__Watching Clash realize his dream is gratifying, and the behind-the-scenes Muppets stuff is fun.__Backstage at the Muppet works, we see countless drawers filled with eyeballs, eyebrows, whiskers and wigs. It's the only world Kevin wanted to live in, and he made it.__The film also provides an inspiring reminder for the young and the rest of us that there is a vital relationship between the best kind of work and passionate play.__The most interesting part of this lively, likable documentary is the journey.__The film is filled with so much insider Muppet lore that, at times, it strains even the goodwill that Clash generates.__A marvelous movie.__A documentary as gentle as its subject: the story of a boy who realized his dream and, on the film's evidence, received a lot of encouragement and support along the way.__"Kevin comes alive through Elmo," says Clash's mother in the film, and it's true. Watching him manipulate the puppet for adoring children, a kindness and joy shines through.__It is, like Sesame Street, a captivating story for viewers of all ages. Even those unfamiliar with cherry-red Elmo will immediately fall under his spell.__Who can fail to be moved by this?__You'd have to be a true Grouch not to be moved.__Even Oscar the Grouch would be moved by the inspiring history of Kevin Clash, the man who gives Elmo his voice.__A winning tale of the persistence and creativity behind one of the most famous and fuzziest faces in the world.__Even committed Elmo-haters may be converted by the time the closing credits roll, because Marks smartly locates the heart of the movie in Clash's devotion to Henson.__Directors Constance Marks and Philip Shane make use of a wealth of fascinating period footage that shows Clash's career ascension.__Constance Marks's documentary on Kevin Clash, the kind, gentle man who created the Muppet beloved by every single child in the world, rushes through the intriguing points its interviewees bring up to devote more time to banalities.
Overall, Jolie has nothing to be embarrassed about and much of which to be proud with this movie.

Even in modern times, what monsters men can be.__It's a tough, clear-eyed look at a ghastly ethnic war, with an admirably wide perspective that affords compassion for both sides.__With its broad strokes, this invitation to an important discussion is hard to ignore, but the blood and honey on the table is an unpalatable mix.__Although Jolie's good intentions are easy to admire, those characters are hard to believe, and the bloody narrative has an oddly bloodless effect.__Jolie crafts a watchable, engaging drama set amid the Bosnian War, proof that she has paid attention during all of these years in front of the camera and has been able to translate that into some skill behind it.__An ambitious if not entirely fully realized drama about the 1990s war in the former Yugoslavia.__Jolie has chosen a complex subject for her feature debut as a writer and director, and although not perfect, it's not for lack of trying.__Is it a bad sign when you want a movie to end almost as much as the war it's about?__The tendency that often sinks Angelina Jolie's performances -- overemphasizing certain naturalistic behaviors at the expense of well-rounded characterization -- more or less sinks her first film as writer-director.__In the Land of Blood and Honey feels like the sober, hard-hitting work of a humanitarian.__A mix of the powerful and the ridiculous, and eventually the ridiculous wins.__You watch the movie wanting to look away, even as it reminds us of history that shouldn't be forgotten.__"Blood and Honey'' is both strong and headstrong, equally invested in grit and glamour with a hazy understanding of the line separating the two.__It's impressively steady filmmaking for a first-timer, and a powerful, powerfully disturbing subject to take on.__In the Land of Blood and Honey captures the sickening way the war in Bosnia became a gray zone of genocide. Yet that, unfortunately, is not enough to make it a good movie.__"In the Land of Blood and Honey" clearly came from the same impulse that has led Jolie into so many humanitarian efforts around the world.__The film does what all war films must, which is to reduce the incomprehensible suffering of countless people into the ultimate triumph of a few.__This is an impressive piece of work that doesn't flinch from the atrocities that no doubt motivated Jolie to make the film in the first place.__Jolie has a keen eye for the core of a scene and a true director's instinct for the pulse that defines character.

Ameena Matthews, Cobe Williams and Eddie Bocanegra used to instigate Chicago street violence. Now they live for nipping it in the bud, block by treacherous block.__Where James's film excels is as direct experiential cinema -- without narration, onscreen interviews or acknowledgment of the presence of the camera -- it is an intensely dramatic window into a world.__A sobering but not hopeless look at how the Windy City is attempting to turn around a rising tide of street shooting, through the work of a unique group called CeaseFire.__There's no doubt The Interrupters do some good; but there's also no doubt the problem they're facing is enormous.__Realistically inspiring and, thankfully, not overly dramatized.__The immediacy and caprice of violence in "The Interrupters'' are just as strong as in nearly every documentary I've seen about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.__Through understanding and fearlessness, this brave trio shows us, the world can be changed, tiny step by tiny step.__"The Interrupters" is an intense and chilling documentary about peacekeeping troops in a war zone.__In the end, statistics are of less moment to this movie than the case-by-case personal successes that, in some cases, are emotionally overwhelming.__Tense, moving, and, at times brain-draining.__A heartbreaking, empowering documentary about inner-city violence...__It tears at your heart with its depiction of the intractability of the problem.

It's hard to feel sorry for a guy who banked millions for not hosting "The Tonight Show" anymore, but it's also fascinating to see a man this compulsively driven to get back in front of people and tell jokes, to hear the laughter, to soak in the applause.__While a lot of geography is covered, as a concert film, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop is decidedly thin entertainment.__It's ... entertaining, not to mention revealing about the emotional toll exacted upon people who, in O'Brien's words, "feed their bone marrow to the wood chipper that is television."__Just as he promised, amazing things happen.__Meta-irony can get a guy who's still grinding an ax only so far.__Forget talk shows; Coco should keep touring and making films like this.__O'Brien admits he ended this moment in his life knowing himself a little better.

A creative, self-aware hissy fit, but still.__What we are seeing is a man determined to vindicate himself after a public humiliation. People attend his shows, cheer him, like him. That proves something, doesn't it?
"Phil Ochs" not only is a good look at a man who carved a small but important niche into the folk world but a good record of the turbulent 1960s and what motivated its protesters.__The short and tragic life of Phil Ochs is as involving as the music he wrote and played, and that is saying a great deal.__A compassionate but not uncritical portrait of an artist whose creativity and vulnerability were inseparable from the political distemper of his era.__At once an unsentimental portrait of the ambitious singer who thought himself bound for glory, and an affecting elegy for a time when song was a form of revolution.__A complex portrait of an ultimately unknowable man.__A warts-and-all portrait of a singer and his celebrity, Phil Ochs: There But for Fortune is an overdue look at the '60s folk movement's anti-Dylan.__Not only a biography but also a running history of the period's left-wing activism, replete with film clips of that decade's tragic events.__Though hewing to a too-conventional structure, Bowser's film is densely researched enough to yield insights not just into its overlooked subject, but also into his overly analyzed era.__A stimulating reflection on the American countercultural protest movement examined through the prism of one of its most impassioned and underappreciated voices.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A wounded and hopeful take on generation gaps and the wider, nearly unbridgeable chasms created by neurological disaster.__A medley of "Memento," "The King's Speech" and "Hair," "The Music Never Stopped" is sentimental pop packaged as a profound rock opera.__The sentiments are real without succumbing to exaggerated sentimentality, thanks in large part to that big lovable lug, J.K. Simmons.__Kohlberg is determined to manipulate your emotions; he succeeds.__It's sentimental, yet so honest and eccentric that it rises above schmaltz.__The Music Never Stopped is often static and follows a familiar trajectory. Yet it has power, partly because Simmons does a fine job of showing how hurt Henry is that his taste didn't imprint on Gabe beyond grade school.__Presumably intended as an inspirational medical drama, this dated effort congeals into stale nostalgia. Mr. Simmons deserves better.__It sounds like TV-grade schmaltz, but it isn't, thanks to expertly astringent work by Simmons...__The songs and a couple of strong performances are only good enough to make the film watchable, not exceptional.__A father-son drama that wraps a gripping neurological oddity in comfortably familiar movie sentimentality.__A powerful, even shattering look as music's power to unite where it once divided.__Sketchy and heavy on the treacle.__Strain is evident elsewhere.__This is the kind of warm, uncluttered, feel-good film that you take your parents to see, and I absolutely mean that in a good way.__A sentimental but deeply felt true story about the healing power of music.__The novel premise and otherwise nuanced performances are enough to hold attention.__None__None__None__None
Turturro creates the sense that music spews spontaneously from the average Neapolitan and limits the film's educational quotient. But as anyone who has been to Naples knows, you don't go there to learn but to live, out loud.__It's a happy ramble through the storied streets with Turturro as our guide, not pretending to be an expert; it's more like having a good friend take you to this place he really loves.__Close to the sublime, especially if you have a thing for sensuous Italians of either gender unleashing ballads of soaring romantic masochism.__This is a one-of-a-kind documentary.__Passione is a surprise and a delight from beginning to end.__What Turturro, who appears in the film as a combination tour guide and impresario, has come up with is closer to a fantasia than a traditional documentary.__A beautifully structured and photographed film, John Turturro's rapturous "Passione" offers a vibrant exploration and celebration of Neapolitan music in all its grit and glory...__Loosely structured as a sort of musical travelogue, with 23 song performances interwoven, it's as passionate as the singers it showcases, enveloping the viewer in the soulful music it celebrates.__[A] ironic, flamboyant and sentimental anthology of the divergent and colliding musical styles of Naples...__Entertainers bloom from nowhere, sing and then vanish - it's rather like an extended music video.__It can sometimes be hard to sit through, but another song is coming soon, and anyway, close your eyes and imagine you're on vacation, sipping vino in a piazza, soaking in the street life.__Viewers who require more context may be frustrated, but the movie is always lively, and its loose approach to history suits its impressionistic style.__As a mix-tape, Passione opens up many possibilities for more guided listening, but as a film, it's at times maddeningly incomplete.__A thorough and thoroughly enjoyable documentary about Neapolitan folk music old and new...__Who needs talking heads for a documentary when they can have singing heads and dancing bodies?__Works best when its director tamps down his impulse to enhance the performances with florid narratives, focusing on just the singer and the song.__While "Passione" praises the spirit of its subjects, it also attends to the discipline and tenacity that makes them worth noticing.__Pic's pleasant collage of reportage and musical perfs features locally renowned recording artists adding their contempo spin to classic Neapolitan songs, often while acting out mini melodramas at the same time in real locations.__None__None
The film is shot with handheld cameras in the standard mockumentary style, but the content is often hilarious, especially when the trolls show up.__Given that the cast improvised all the scenes live on set, the dialogue has a surprising ring of truth, and is shot through with an unexpected, often unsettling, humour.__It's so steeped in troll and paranoia lore, it risks boring you with the details at times. But it also makes you more inclined to believe it, and the frights are real enough.__Those fog-draped fjords provide a distractingly pretty backdrop to this tale of mysterious, massive creatures who roam the forest by night, searching for Christians on whom to munch.__It can't seem to make up its mind about whether it wants to frighten us or make us laugh. It does a little bit of both, to be sure, but not nearly enough of either to make much of a lasting impression.__"Trollhunter" has a lot of down time as the crew treks to the fjords, but it's also got dryly subversive humor and, eventually, some impressive special effects.__With impressive technical credits, stunning fjord and forest locations and a winking ownership of its own absurdity, "Trollhunter" manages to be at once spooky, satirical and endearing.__Andre Ovredal's enjoyably goofy scare-pic purports to offer real footage of real horror - in this case, a variety of forest and mountain trolls...__Once again, material for a great short film has been expanded to feature length at its peril and ours. Still, this is clever stuff and surprisingly engrossing on its own terms.__A monster movie with a love for mountainous, tree-lined Scandinavian scenery and an even greater love for setting memorably ugly, hulking and destructive mythological creatures against it.__They spend a great deal of time roaring, bleating, squealing and snorting at a very high volume, which is, after a point, too much of a muchness.__Successful on multiple levels, with a brisk pace, excellent location work and a strong lead performance by Norwegian comedian Otto Jespersen.__A drily comic blend of irresistible ingredients that gets better as it goes along.__This is what happens when the Norwegians try to make their own "Blair Witch Project": We get three-headed trolls that hate Vitamin D and references to "Deliverance."__You'll want to catch this clever movie before Hollywood ruins everything with a dumb remake.__Genially simpleminded and more sweet than scary, Trollhunter never settles on a tone. Fairytale fantasy, supernatural comedy, serious horror? All are sampled, to the detriment of the whole.__One of the many pleasures of the Norwegian director Andre Ovredal's clever and engaging mock documentary "Trollhunter" is the way it plays with the idea of the supernatural rule book.__Here's what's not so good in Troll Hunter: the actual troll hunting.__As the stoic titular slayer, Otto Jespersen is the one actor who holds you.__Like the folks who dreamed up lycanthropy, the Trollhunter writers either have an abundance of imagination or they've been smoking a controlled substance.
__Almost inevitably, a film made from these snippets is less than the sum of its parts.__This pointillistic view of everyday people never quite gels as a movie, but it has its point-and-click moments.__What I took away were some individual moments from people whose lives I wish had played out more.__Give Macdonald and crew credit for picking out good, clear, telling contrasts, and not sweating potential heavy-handedness.__It strives awfully hard for depth but, more often than not, comes off too shallow.__There are dull spots, as with any other day, yet "Life" aims to be, and occasionally is, like a YouTube-y "Our Town," giving a sense of what it is to be alive on planet Earth.__Despite having no conventional narrative, other than the sleeping, waking, rising, bathing, eating and living cycles of ordinary people across the globe, "Life in a Day" is, without exaggeration, a profound achievement.__Some of the material is banal, especially upon a second viewing. Some of it undoubtedly represents great acting by canny contributors. But the vast majority of the film feels undeniably real and incredibly inspiring.__Judging by the National Geographic doc "Life in a Day," a lot of nothing happened on July 24, 2010.__"Life in a Day" is "Koyaanisqatsi" minus the consistent visual imagination that made that film bearable.__"Life in a Day" is at once ambitious in its global reach and modest in its simplicity.__Kevin Macdonald's documentary imposes a semblance of unity on a planet of unfathomable diversity.__Carved out of cyber-reality and global in reach, this fast-paced documentary is shaped as much by Internet savvy as traditional filmmaking, which doesn't make the experience of it any less satisfying, or the implications any less provocative.__What could have been a gimmick turns out to be philosophical and heartfelt.__If nothing else, Life In A Day serves as a fine time capsule, recording some of what life was like on Earth in 2010.__"Life in a Day" is so intimate and ultimately optimistic, it'll leave you with the inescapable feeling that you've just made hundreds of new friends you've never actually met.__So freshly edited, the clips so free of the usual YouTube Stupid Human Tricks coyness, that it's easy to get addicted to its clear-eyed celebration of the rituals and dislocating comedy of life in the 21st century.__The resulting object is less about the world than about itself, and feels like a hey-that's-neat 90-minute troll through the video-sharing website.__'Life in a Day' has an intoxicating and sometimes even overwhelming rhythm and power, helped no end by Matthew Herbert's inventive score.
My Perestroika has the quality of a candid conversation with long-lost cousins from another country.__Like all of us, they are looking back on the best and most brilliant times of youth. It's a universal longing that knows no politics.__"My Perestroika" is specific to Russia, of course, but the juvenile certainty and conformity it chronicles seem universal.__It not only evocatively captures the Russian spirit and the yearnings of a generation, but it also masterfully chronicles the historic collapse of the Soviet Union and its complex aftermath.__The openness of these people is often astonishing -- and a sign of hope.__"My Perestroika" reminds us that no matter how repressive a government, no matter how entrenched attitudes may seem, underneath the surface there are countless individuals very much like us.__"My Perestroika'' offers a surprising and revealing look at Russia's past and present.__There is little discussion of the Putin regime, but it will be interesting to see what today's kids will say about it 25 years from now.__My Perestroika is fairly foursquare as documentary filmmaking goes; it isn't stylistically snazzy, nor doggedly verite.__A fascinating portrait of life in Moscow -- behind the Iron Curtain and after its fall.__There are no dry talking heads, no droning lists of Soviet leaders and events, just raw experience.__Don't miss this.__The subjects, plainspoken and insightful, attempt to extract the objective lessons of the political past from their subjective fortunes.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
For those of us who don't have an deep interest in freeze-drying, 'El Bulli' is astonishingly, sub-'Masterchef' dull.__You leave "Cooking in Progress" with respect for a man who followed his vision, and with fascination at the idea of food as artistic expression.__If you're passionate (and open-minded) about food, you'll be fascinated.__If your idea of fine dining is pumpkin meringue sandwiches, bone marrow tartare with oysters, tea shrimp with caviar anemones, and ice vinaigrette with tangerines and green olive, then by all means make haste to El Bulli.__Offers a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes at the Spanish restaurant hailed as the most influential eatery in the world.__We're made to marvel at slow-cooked, freeze-dried, unappetizingly bagged food, the way some mushrooms, when delicately sliced, evoke fruit and some crustaceans resemble side-sleeping snooze-bar slappers.__El Bulli becomes a haunting celebration of the human desire to turn food into art - even if the results are consciously insane.__El Bulli barely registers a pulse stronger than a book's.__A fascinating observational doc about the most famous restaurant in the world.__The flat camerawork and lack of a story beyond the framework of six months in the city lab and six months at El Bulli gives us little to sink our teeth into.__For hardcore foodies, El Bulli offers a clear, unvarnished look at the master at work.__It's a sluggish portrait that neither captures nor replicates the dazzle, pacing and polish of an El Bulli meal. Check, please.__A tasty documentary by Gereon Wetzel.__"What matters is that it's magical, that it opens up a new path," Adria reminds. Cooking in Progress is, in fact, all magic and no path__Anyone looking for the lowdown on haute cuisine will be sorely disappointed: devoid of emotion, context or narrative, the baffling avant-garde techniques and extreme politesse of the lab become oppressively dull.__Immaculately crafted.__None__None__None__None
It's a comic-strip version of one man's life and times, but it's tres cool.__While the movie's on a roll, it's zesty, engaging and frisky.__In short, Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life is a charmer.__French pop star Serge Gainsbourg was as much iconoclast as icon, so it's fitting that this fanciful biopic is both affectionate and irreverent.__Alas, "Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life" loses steam and grows more perfunctory as it wears on.__It's the story of a genius with no moral sense and no interests beyond sensuality. The catchy, insinuating music can only carry you so far.__For better and for worse, Sfar's a fan, and his movie is a busy love letter to Gainsbourg that skates along the surface of the legend.__Why was Gainsbourg a hero? The film leaves the question hanging. I am afraid it was only because, like Sinatra, he did it his way. Which no one can deny.__A viewer who comes into "Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life" knowing nothing about Serge Gainsbourg will not come out the other side especially enlightened about the late French-Jewish singer-songwriter's life, least of all why it is heroic.__Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life accepts its subject on his own terms. And the compromise feels like capitulation before its hero's last record spins to a close.__While Sfar doesn't dare tinker with the facts or sully the mystique, he gains enormous traction via the imaginative and subversive manner he has devised to tell a story that, in many ways, is hard to believe.__A sloggy fantasia about Gainsbourg's life featuring such oddities as a giant, hook-nosed puppet that acts as the singer's alter ego, as well as a parade of showy sequences involving grand Gainsbourg amours Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin.__A lively bout between bio-pic and fairy tale.__If only all biopics were as entertaining as this...__Unconventional, imaginative, nothing if not audacious, "Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life" is a portrait of creativity from the inside, a serious yet playful attempt to find an artistic way to tell an emotional truth.__One could hardly make an honest movie about Gainsbourg that wasn't as recklessly ambitious as this.__Beyond its fantasy elements, Sfar's film doesn't color outside the lines as much as he might like us to think.__There's one good reason to see this biopic of the French pop-cabaret songster Serge Gainsbourg, and that's its lead actor, Erik Elmosnino.__Despite the attention the film pays to the divide between the man as the ungainly, loving second-gen immigrant versus the boozy provocateur, it's not a portrait of much psychological depth.__Laetitia Casta steals the movie as Bardot, slinking down the hall in a miniskirt and knee-high black boots, leading a dog on a leash, then cavorting nude behind a bedsheet as Gainsbourg knocks out a song on the piano.
Drab in color, with very little of Brighton-they shot in neighboring Eastbourne, apparently because Brighton is too posh now to be its old self.____As remakes go, this "Brighton Rock" is probably unnecessary, but it's a well- acted, stylishly filmed thriller and a good story well told.__There's a brutish beauty to the mean world of Brighton Rock that feels very '40s even in the '60s.__"Brighton Rock" doesn't rise to classic status, but it's an intriguing mood piece.__Joffe commits the novice director's mistake of using every visual trick in the book and a few not yet recorded.____Evocative music and stylish visual flourishes from first-time director Rowan Joffe bring heft to a predictable thriller set during a summer of youthful unrest.__Brighton's "not what she used to be," says one gangster, and that sure is a shame: The 1947 adaptation was so much more, and so much more strange.__Brighton Rock is still compelling, which proves yet again that Greene is such a cinematic storyteller that his books are nearly damageproof.__Where the first film had a lawyer spouting Shakespeare, this one mostly has visual panache - crosses and crucifixes rather than dialogue about religion.__All in all, this new Brighton Rock strikes me as a minor but effective exercise in neo-noir style.__Mirren is marvelous, as is Riley. The score, with Martin Phipps clearly channeling Bernard Herrmann, is full of tentative, melancholy melodies and dark, swirling moods.__Screams "student film" with practically every frame.__A beautiful-looking noir about a British gangster whose trap for a witness messes up his mob life.__The film is almost distractingly beautiful to look at, something that accentuates the tension between the film's conflicting quantities, i.e., the glories of the physical world, and the corrupted humanity it hosts.__Mr. Joffe has turned "Brighton Rock" into a full-scale film noir with the stylistic undertow of a more modern British gangster movie.__I'm still trying to figure out what mods have to do with Brighton Rock, and I can only guess that Joffe glommed onto the little town's best known pop-culture credential in hope of connecting with a broader, or perhaps younger, international audience.__What was once an impurely pure outpost of Graham Greeneland now feels a bit like the Who's "Quadrophenia,'' with mods and rockers mixing it up around the edges.__The new film version of Graham Greene's 1938 novel "Brighton Rock" isn't very good, but if you haven't yet seen the 1947 film version of Greene's book, do so! It's the right time to do so.
The result is gripping, moving and revelatory, an unabashed if implicit critique of the death penalty.____Herzog is pursuing no agenda with Into the Abyss, despite his opposition to extreme judicial measures. He's seeking to answer the question of why people kill, especially in a situation such as this where the reason for the murders was so meaningless.__Into the Abyss does what too few documentaries these days do - it gives ample play to all sides of the argument. Herzog allows us to think things through on our own.__The overriding point of Into the Abyss, what keeps this sad, sorrowful film from becoming depressing and elevates it far above the usual chatter of liberal-conservative debate, is that there can be light on the other end of even the darkest of tunnels.__"Into the Abyss" makes a strong case for the inhumanity of capital punishment, regardless of the crime or the criminal.__Herzog's investigation may not work as an anti-death-penalty editorial, but its findings are undeniably profound.__A disquieting, heartbreaking look at American crime and punishment.__The abyss here isn't capital punishment, the ostensible subject of the film; it's the seemingly unending capacity for causing and enduring pointless misery that humans seem to have.__It's an uneven movie, but a heartfelt and honest one.__An inquiry into fundamental moral, philosophical, and religious issues, and an examination of humankind's capacity for violence - individual and institutional.__Watching Into the Abyss, I had the overwhelming sense that, somewhere along the way, Werner Herzog lost his way.__It's like a TV crime reality show made by an alien.__What could have been a well-aimed examination of the most troubling contradictions of capital punishment instead becomes a maudlin, unrestrained wallow.__Werner Herzog looks at the death penalty in "Into the Abyss," and as is almost always the case, to look through his eyes is to marvel.__Any subject Werner Herzog wants to explore is surely worthy of our interest. And his latest documentary is a characteristically insightful study of human nature.__Not since Errol Morris' masterwork of investigative documentary, "The Thin Blue Line," has a filmmaker had such an easy time of making the death penalty-crazed state of Texas look quite so casually venal.__The paradox of this film is that it is both unremittingly bleak and rigorously humane.__What is missing is something new - clarity, insight, outrage. Instead, its understatement is ultimately its undoing.__The movie's an "In Cold Blood'' with a patient, persistent German interlocutor instead of Truman Capote turning cartwheels in prose.
Sam and Rasheen's icky pas de deux is coarsely shoehorned into a movie that juggles three tepid romantic mini-dramas.__It's sluggish and trite and irrelevant in a way that suggests that the TV soundstage is a kind of hothouse that Radnor doesn't leave often enough.__[A] perky, if undistinguished, emulation of a mid-period Woody Allen relationship comedy...__A case of when bad scripts happen to good actors. Given its similarities to a bygone sitcom, one might call it Friends without benefits.__There is a sweetness to Radnor's character and to his film. What there is not is a sense of urgency, of a desire to find out what happens next.__It's an observant and heartfelt film, with turns of dialogue that show that writer-director Josh Radnor really can write.__Kate Mara gives a breakout performance. She should be a star.__As if this weren't enough baggage for one movie, especially an indie movie, Radnor front-loads the proceedings with further complications.__Radnor offers an entertaining and not especially self-indulgent ensemble comedy about young love in the big city that spotlights an appealing cast of youthful fringe-of-Hollywood talent.__This unbearably cutesy and hackneyed movie is a vanity piece starring, and written and directed by, mild sitcom presence Josh Radnor.__A film whose extreme self-consciousness begins with the title and carries through.__Treating their problems like they're the most important crises in the world is what people in their 20s do, but that doesn't mean we have to go along for the ride.__HappyThankYouMorePlease features enough well-observed touches to prove Radnor deserved this shot...__With very little modification, the relationship woes of the six chirpy young New Yorkers in this (happythankyoumoreplease) self-absorbed indie could be reworked into episodes of TV's How I Met Your Mother.__Arrested Development's Tony Hale nearly overcomes the gently worthless script.__With the exception of Akerman's Annie, the characters are uniformly annoying, their stories insubstantial and the tone one of smug contentment. Production values are grade-A.__This clearly is an actors' movie, and they all blossom in that environment.__None__None__None
One of the highest-grossing films in Hong Kong history, but it doesn't add much to the crowded history of martial-arts movies.__"Ip Man 2" has eye candy to spare. But it is lacking in formalities such as character development and plot coherence, and the stereotyped Brits are straight out of central casting.__Director Wilson Yip keeps the movie moving as fast as the whiplash action.__The film's fight choreography is again handled by the legendary Sammo Hung - he also now has a supporting role and incredibly shot his own fight scenes while recuperating from heart surgery - and that alone makes the film worth checking out.__"Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grand Master" is distinguished by a string of stylishly choreographed martial-arts combat scenes, though barely serviceable in its storytelling.__A redundant if nonetheless occasionally thrilling follow-up bolstered by star Donnie Yen's precision combat skills.__A smashing martial arts extravaganza dented by crude nationalism.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This story, parboiled out of one of the most memorable Westerns, is supported all the way by Gil's directing.__Shepard's crusty charisma gives this dignified genre effort its pulse: a growl-off between his Butch and Jeff Bridges's Rooster Cogburn is surely the next chapter.__It ain't Paul Newman and Robert Redford, but it ain't bad.__In place of a rousing adventure, "Blackthorn" is a haunting ode.__Although Shepard is perfectly cast as a world-weary outlaw reluctantly drawn into one more adventure, the movie doesn't quite justify the resuscitation of classic film characters for another outing.__"Blackthorn" feels less like a proper sequel to "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which it purports to be, than a coattail rider.__A different kind of Western - somber, reflective and set in the elevated plains and salt flats of Bolivia.__The filmmakers didn't have a lot of options. In some ways the new picture feels like a boxed-in replay.__Each frame is a crystalline jaw-dropper that places the smallish actions of men within a vast canvas of lush jungle, lunar salt flats, Andean snow, and desert sand. The result is a pretty good movie that almost looks better than it needs to.__Spanish director Mateo Gil reappraises the last desperado's legend in a funny, violent examination of America and American cowboy films.__Shepard's performance is one to remember.__Butch has grown old? And homesick? And gets waylaid, and is back in action again? Was this trip necessary?__Mateo Gil's sturdy Western makes a nicely melancholy flipside to George Roy Hill's more rambunctious classic.__Director Mateo Gill's autumnal movie has elements of other late-era Westerns in its blood, but it isn't easily pigeonholed.__In his best performance since "The Right Stuff'' turned him into a reluctant movie star, Shepard makes "Blackthorn'' worth seeing.__If nothing else, the film reminds just how arresting an actor Shepard can be. Like Blackthorn, he's only gotten better with age.__The filmmakers rely on Mr. Shepard to lend the character some of his mythic weight, but it would take an actor with greater range to make Butch more than a cardboard outlaw-saint.__Shepard sells it with a depth and a conflicted sense of remorse that pulls this folk hero down to earth.__It never lacks for the arid, vista-prone beauty of a classic Western, or for a sense of lived-in wear and tear that remains convincing even though it's more stylized than realistic.__This lightness finally overshadows the story's elegiac potential and leaves the toll of Cassidy's exile largely untapped, and even Shepard's magnetism can't lift Blackthorn above the status of cinematic lark.
It hedges its bets in the big climax--so to speak.__You don't review a movie like "A Good Old-Fashioned Orgy." You autopsy it.__Jason Sudeikis, mildly annoying in small doses, turns out to be greatly annoying in large ones, as our hero.__Sitting through "A Good Old Fashioned Orgy" is like being monopolized by the most irritating person at a really boring party.__Chlamydia, gonorrhea and Jason Sudeikis are three reasons to stay well clear of "A Good Old Fashioned Orgy," but they're not the only ones.__Gregory and Huyck keep their frat boy (and girl) lark grounded while making sure no bit is left untouched.__Feels as if it had been conceived and written on the back of a cocktail napkin, then handed over to the actors in hope they could come up with some funny business. No such luck.__These immature, fairly pitiable protagonists go about their absurd project in all the wrong ways. But you just keep rooting for them.__By accident or design, the resolution here is morally ambiguous and vaguely distasteful, which may be the reason I liked it.__The movie keeps its balance better than its leering title might suggest.__Movies about raising children or reconnecting with lost loves can be subtle and slow paced. But orgy movies need to go all out. There doesn't appear to be any other way.__More amusing than you might expect, but probably not by much.__I scrawled the words completely unappealing people in my trusty notebook, sitting there in the dark in the early going of A Good Old Fashioned Orgy.__We may not yet have arrived at "Brave New World," but this movie about a group of 30ish friends inhibited by the threat of AIDS from sexually running wild, suggests we are lurching and bumbling in that direction.__There's a pretty decent comedy somewhere in "A Good Old Fashioned Orgy,'' if only it wasn't so attracted to everyone else in the room.__Grab a brew, check your sophistication at the door and just enjoy the ride.__There's funny and then there's funny, and "A Good Old-Fashioned Orgy" is neither.__Gregory and Huyck's underachieving film is like a smart but lazy student who doesn't feel the need to study. It's good enough to pass, but could benefit from much more ambition.__[It's] undercut by a jokey, smart-aleck approach to every scene that plays like disposable sitcom humor.__This is a comedy without wit and soul. It strands fairly likable actors in a morass of the kind of dialogue only stupid characters ever say - and then only when reading stupid screenplays.
"October Baby" looks and feels like a Lifetime movie waiting not to happen.__The odds that this has happened in the real world approach those of being struck by lightning and eaten by a shark at the same time. With a winning lottery ticket tucked in your swimsuit.__[An] earnest, faith-based drama, which lacks sufficient entertainment value to make its message go down more palatably.__Trafficking in 2-D morality and unlikely to be seen by the unconverted, "October Baby" would have been better off as a bumper sticker.__"October Baby" doesn't even meet the standards of decent propaganda. It is, in fact, indecent propaganda.__"October Baby" may be well-intentioned, but it's as obvious and inert as a spoonful of mashed potatoes.__Extended scenes are dominated by heavy dialogue, while the lighter moments are relegated to montages of prancing across a beach, for example, which simply aren't that effective at buoying the drama.__Like the bloodied placards brandished by demonstrators outside women's health clinics, the film communicates in the language of guilt and fear.__The closer Hannah gets to her goal, the more insistent the sermonizing becomes. By the time she confronts the woman who rejected her (a careerist lawyer), we are neck-deep in Lifetime TV bathos.__A film whose poignancy is hard to deny whatever side of the abortion debate you fall on.__Directors Andrew and Jon Erwin, who also contributed to the story, rarely let their film get didactic, instead going for a more low-key approach.__Newcomer Rachel Hendrix grabs attention and sustains sympathy as a lovely yet troubled 19-year-old student determined to unlock the secrets of her past.__This isn't a movie; this is propaganda for the already converted.__The film as a whole is amateurish and ungainly, can't find a consistent tone, is too long, is overladen with music that tries to paraphrase the story and is photographed with too many beauty shots that slow the progress.__A slick piece of pro-life propaganda, it has relatively luxe production values, painfully earnest performances, and a drippy "inspirational" score.__None__None__None__None__None
A reflection on power and betrayal, on the thin line between acting as your conscience demands and protecting obligations close to your heart.__Sayles is always an interesting storyteller, and if "Amigo" isn't typical of his subtler methods, it's still a compelling look at history and its continuing influence.__"Amigo" might be the talkiest war movie ever made.__You could argue that the chief villain of the ambiguously titled "Amigo" is language, which is used quite deliberately to mock and mislead and betray.__By choosing Rafael as its hero, "Amigo" looks not only at a little-known part of American history, but at a rarely examined type of movie character.__An engrossing, perceptive, supremely humane drama about imperialism and loyalty.__The overlong "Amigo" has its heart in the right place, but its approach to complex issues is too simplistic to win over unconverted minds.__Uneven but ultimately affecting...__A heavy-handed attack on U.S. imperialism with little to compensate in the way of character interest and genuine drama.__"Amigo" is a well-carpentered narrative, fast-moving and emphatic, stepping nimbly from gravity to good humor.__John Sayles, a filmmaker by trade, a provocateur by nature, means to stir things up with Amigo. That he does, and more power to him.__The problem is that this pot of intrigue takes ages to boil, and the cook refuses to turn up the heat.__A beautifully shot, beautifully acted, rich piece that whispers its messages rather than shouting them.__Few filmmakers are ambitious enough these days to try addressing our present world-policing endeavors through the prism of past ones, so it almost seems churlish to take Sayles to task for relying on overly dogmatic storytelling.__It feels more florid and earnest -- a little too eager to make friends -- than Sayles' other films, but it also feels more passionate and provocative than 99% of everything else out there.__Admirably sincere but bluntly simplistic.__It's a familiar tale, but the setting is different, and Sayles tells it with his usual cinematic vigor and attention to small detail.__None__None__None
Weerasethakul's sincerity is evident, though the film's meditative pace and vague philosophical undertones will not be for everyone.__This is a film that wants to be interesting, and it certainly is that. Whether you want to dine with the ghost and the monkey-man or not, they bring a new perspective to the table.__As is to be expected, Weerasethakul frequently abandons the story for trancelike contemplations of nature, but never before in his work has the device felt more purposeful.__While the result is pretty much the definition of a film that should be experienced, not explained, there's no sense here that Weerasethakul is being difficult for difficult's sake, or even attempting to conceal his mysteries.__It playfully invokes both the lifestyle and animistic beliefs of the Northeast country folk, and the primitive magic of early Thai cinema, relating both of these to his musings on reincarnation.__If you are open, even in fancy, to the idea of ghosts who visit the living, this film is likely to be a curious but rather bemusing experience.__What would pass for longueurs in another director's movie become commands for rumination here.__It takes a while to get used to Joe's peculiar style of filmmaking, but once you do, you'll go with the flow, not worrying about the abstractness of the plot.__If you can weather some slow patches (and there are plenty), this boldly original, oddly affecting meditation on the afterlife will reward you with moments of profundity that will linger in your consciousness (or subconsciousness) for a lifetime...__A special taste, dreamlike and sometimes opaque, or at least translucent, to logical analysis.__"Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives" is a one-of-a-kind mixture of the extraordinary and the everyday.__A moving, gently reassuring tale that softens the boundaries between humanity and nature, life and the afterlife.__Spirit, animal, and human worlds coexist in dreamy harmony in this remarkable drama, winner of the 2010 Cannes Palme d'Or.__Instead of nostalgia for vanished magic, there is the recognition that magic is always present if we know where and how to look. Mr. Weerasethakul certainly knows where to look and is generous enough to share some of what he sees.__A work of unostentatious beauty and uncloying sweetness, at once sophisticated and artless, mysterious and matter-of-fact, cosmic and humble.__The slightly muzzy, blended photography is often beautiful, and an aura of the uncanny-the spirit life entering the everyday-is strangely affecting.__Uncle Boonmee is entrancing-and also, if you're not sufficiently steeped in its rhythms, narcotizing.__Takes a sweet, long time to work its magic on you.__What you see and hear always seems perfectly natural, even if you can't exactly say why. Who needs words when you have cinema?__A slow-burning cinematic riddle that worms its dreamy abstractions through the likes of melodrama, comedy, horror, fable, and documentary, [the film] is a free-spirited, hypnotic masterpiece-and that's not a word to be thrown around lightly.
__The practice and performance sequences are compelling, but the history of the dance style, the intricacies of judging and the personalities of the hoofers are hardly addressed.__It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but as movies about Irish dance competitions go, well, it's pretty high on that list.__Uncovers the sweat and toil behind all the sparkly outfits and clickety-clack footwork.__Bourne shows little knowledge or curiosity about her subject and doesn't find its magic in this pedestrian documentary.__Bourne belabors the judges' final decision to such an excruciating length, it makes the whole movie feel a bit more cloddish than it should.__Too close to a TV dance competition show to go far in theaters.__Jig is both inspiring and a cautionary tale about obsession among youngsters.__Smallpox has been eliminated from the planet -- so why can't our finest minds seem to be able to do anything about Irish step dancing?__This highly involving film deftly captures the unique physical, emotional and financial aspects of diving into competitive Irish dance, with the participants' addictive immersion the overwhelming takeaway.__This programmatic entry in the tykes-and-trophies genre has too much on its plate and not nearly enough on its mind.__"Jig'' is involving, if at times overly slick.__Must every subculture competition receive a pop documentary?__If the structure behind Jig seems familiar, it is. That's because Sue Bourne's film employs the same formula as nearly every entry in an increasingly prevalent documentary subgenre devoted to chronicling specialized competitions.__There are too many personal stories and themes (rivalry, triumph over adversity, the nobility of sportsmanlike determination...) slugging it out here.__None__None__None__None__None
__At once a deeply personal film and an important historical document, The Man Nobody Knew leaves us with an incomplete portrait of a man.__There's a reason spies are called spooks; it's as if they have no human essence. If William Colby had one, his son hasn't found it in this film. But he has found the emptiness. And that's something.__Presumably, Colby would be pleased to know he comes across as neither compelling nor vivid - which in some ways makes him all the more interesting.__To some degree, its subject remains tantalizingly unknowable, even after all the witnesses have taken the stand.__Fascinating.__A remarkable feat of personalized biography.__Powerful isn't the word, although shattering may be, for the conclusion that the son reaches at the end of his lonely quest.__Uniquely personal look at one of the 20th century's most important spy figures.__Although much of the documentary is given over to its subject's private life... The Man Nobody Knew never feels particularly intimate__Carl Colby's smart, fact-packed film "The Man Nobody Knew" operates on many levels, all riveting.__The Man Nobody Knew is far better with matters of the public record than with matters of the home, which may sum up its subject better than any talking-head interview.__In terms of looking back on a legacy of American skullduggery and high-level shenanigans, its access and acknowledgment of our dark past make for one intimate indictment.__Respectful, loving, but never lionizing, Carl's thorough investigation transcends his personal catharsis to become an enduring treatise on how character flaws affect policy.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Bellflower revs the engine of an exciting new maverick.__A delightfully strange hybrid creature.__Possibly represents the debut of a one-of-a-kind filmmaker, a natural driven by wild energy, like Tarantino.__It's like the world's coolest iPhone camera app writ large, and while it'd be misleading to make too much of this picture, it'd be a shame to make too little of it, either.__After a while, "Bellflower" feels like it can't stop checking itself out in the mirror. It's a pose, not a movie.__Handmade and helpless, it's nevertheless the real deal, an artful blurt of sensitivity and rage.__Bellflower is weirdly gorgeous. Its intentional post-romanticism is mirrored in evocative chapter headings and ace cinematographer Joel Hodge's images (using a camera of the director's tweaking).__Glodell doesn't have the emotional intelligence or filmmaking finesse of the early Martin Scorsese, but his film is a new-millennium descendant of "Mean Streets."__Equally fascinating and tedious, "Bellflower" is a lost cause of a movie, torn apart by incompatible ambitions.__"Bellflower," writer, director and star Evan Glodell's debut, bursts at the seams with wild creativity.____As the guys' favorite character from "The Road Warrior" might say: Too much violence, and too much pain, but there is within it some sort of honorable compromise.__Glodell is a filmmaker with a future, if the apocalypse doesn't get in the way.__This frequently dazzling, eccentric portrait of mutually assured destruction is that most delirious of combos: charmingly funny and emotionally terrifying.__Evan Glodell's explosive debut feature is a thing of toxic beauty.__A daring feature debut by Evan Glodell, "Bellflower" looks like it was shot with the digital equivalent of a Brownie box camera, and generates an almost palpable aura of anxiety.__There's more here than initially meets and sometimes assaults the eye, including the hyperbolic dudeness of it all.__It is, without a doubt, a striking debut. But it's also punishingly distasteful and disjointed almost beyond coherence, a repetitive heap of a film that feels disgorged rather than crafted.__Bellflower is stylishly watchable - even when it's preposterous.__In one grease-monkey swoop, Glodell proves that he's a subversive talent worth following. Let a thousand of his future projects bloom.
A truly eye-opening experience.____A nearly unbearable examination of good and bad in the human heart.__Guzman offers a poetic narrative that celebrates the searches and insists on the moral obligation to remember Chile's not-too-distant past.__The filmmaker's masterpiece, an exquisitely filmed, poetically written meditation on how past and present fuse in humanity's most unresolved questions.__A film of rare visual poetry that's simultaneously personal, political and philosophical, it's a genuine art film that's also unpretentious and easygoing.__"I am convinced that memory has gravitational force," says Guzman in conclusion. "Nostalgia" states his case so beautifully that even skeptical physicists will be thoroughly convinced.__Katell Djian's stunning cinematography adds to the film's power.__The film's passionate insistence on remembrance lends it a moral as well as a metaphysical weight. Mr. Guzman's belief in eternal memory is an astounding leap of faith.__As a work of nonfiction, it deserves its own nomenclature. "Docu-poem" is too inelegant; "masterpiece" works, although it's been used before.__A moving meditation on history, knowledge and mortality.__Has the overwhelming power of an outrage to decency.__Nostalgia for the Light isn't didactic in the strictest sense. It simply shows the truth, illuminated by [Patricio Guzman]'s poetic voiceover narration and the found sound of wind and footsteps that echo across the desert plains.__Patricio Guzman's documentary, Nostalgia for the Light, pays equal attention to the astronomers and searchers, regarding their quest as the same -- a search for life.__None__None__None__None__None__None
If you haven't seen a wasting disease in real life, you might think "Restless" is romantic. If you have, you might diagnose it as terminally cute.__All surface, no thought and quite horribly empty.__Restless is consciously lovely in the face of death. How rare.__This low-budget movie takes its time filling in the backgrounds of its characters. That works for a while, but when it's over you may wonder if that's all there is.__Gus Van Sant doesn't make bad movies.__Van Sant lays on the whimsy with a trowel; Wasikowska's quirky thrift-store wardrobe and twinkling performance are enough to trigger migraines.__If anyone other than Gus Van Sant had directed Restless, the film could have well been impossible to sit through.__"Restless" is far more precious than profound. But that takes little away from this soulful teenage exploration of love, life and death.__A film that is often as insipid as one of Nicholas Sparks's commercial melodramas.__"Twee" doesn't begin to describe this set-up, and it doesn't suit Gus Van Sant, or any director for that matter.__Is the title meant as a joke? A torpidly precious love story about death-obsessed adolescents, the film's becalmed and embalmed in its own sensitive self-pity.__In its episodic bits of quirk and whimsy, and its romantic morbidity, it's a project that smacks of film school - you can practically follow the cookie crumbs of Wes Anderson and Harold and Maude and the French New Wave.__Not this era's "Love Story," despite its most ingratiating efforts to find meaning, laughter and romance by way of a too-young protagonist battling cancer.__[A] moody, tiresomely whimsical tale.__The film is morbid and mawkish, and packed with enough forced whimsy to make you scream.__An uncommonly touching romance about a young man and woman who essentially worship at the shrines of their own deaths.__Van Sant salts the film with moments of macabre humor, but never goes beyond the bounds of good taste. His directorial touch is restrained.__This overly twee, morbidly cute romance initially digs up the ageless "Harold and Maude" as a touchstone before it slips the coils of watchability.__Unlike Van Sant's grittier, less sentimental recent small films, it's twee enough to make your teeth ache. It's the director's biggest miscalculation since "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" 18 years ago.__The film errs on the side of formula even as it carries the sheen and delicacy of something handmade.
The situation continues to fester, the balance of power shifts back and forth among some wonderfully defined characters.__The graphic sex scenes radiate an uncommon heat, and Im can pull off a hugely effective shock when he wants to.__The movie kowtows to the old truism that the rich are different - but it does it with a sardonic smile.__Writer-director Im Sang-Soo injects a certain sense of otherworldliness in the proceedings -- the final scene is straight from David Lynchland --- which may not make things mesmerizing, but does deliver a consistently odd angle.__"The Housemaid" scores on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin.__"The Housemaid" glitters coldly, with its marble surfaces and scheming eyes, as it builds to its dramatic, unexpected climax.__While the film grows increasingly preposterous in its final act, the enigmatic performances of Youn and Jeon carry the day.__The secret weapon of "The Housemaid'' - the reason it works at all - is Jeon in the title role.__Sang-soo does with "The Housemaid" what many filmmakers do with remakes of influential genre films. He amps up the sex and smoothes down the stylistic edges of the original.__This story is told by writer-director Im Sang-soo with cool, elegant cinematography and sinuous visual movements.__It's a deliciously perverse melodrama.__Even with the piece wobbling between dark psychology and campy soap, the cast is compelling as it navigates the uncertainty.__An often sexy and well-acted thriller, with rich bad people doing terrible things to nice poor ones.__It is beautifully shot, with impeccable acting and visual detail. Now, if someone will just explain the brief, head-scratching coda.__Mr. Im's voluptuous visual palette combined with the dexterity of his cast is enough to hold your interest and, at times, to make you hold your breath.__The Housemaid remains compelling mostly for Yun's performance, which is just as inscrutable, but ever-shifting-at times vaguely sinister, at others full of wisdom and quiet resolve.__There's something nicely kinky in this lusciously photographed erotic Korean thriller by Im Sang-soo - at least for those who don't compare it to the far kinkier, out-there 1960 original by Kim Ki-young.__Follows the basic blueprint of Kim's film; some of the particulars, however, have been monkeyed with, to mostly shallow effect.__Despite eccentric touches, like a handheld street-shot overture and Grand Guignol Omen references, there's little difference between this story and soap-opera intrigue.__A flamingly sexy soap opera whose satire on high society is sometimes as savage as Claude Chabrol's La ceremonie.
Helps us to dive headfirst into both the journey and period and decide for ourselves whether to take it or leave it.__Records a lot of silly misbehavior but only minor merriment.__It's the movie "Yellow Submarine'' should have been but didn't know how to be.__"Magic Trip" is neither as magic nor as trippy as the culture quake that it documents, but it's a valuable flashback and a pleasurable contact high.__This is the story of sunny, casual West Coast visionary utopians, told from the inside out.__It isn't exactly boring. But it's hard being the designated driver at someone else's bacchanal.__To be sure, one gets a better sense of the personalities, and the passions stirring their souls, in Wolfe's book. But Magic Trip literally brings these characters to life.__Fans of the subject matter, especially students of the Beat era, will find this revisionist reconstruction indispensible; others will share the same tedium claimed by some of the principals on the bus.__The result may have value to '60s sociologists, ethnologists, superannuated hippies, and Kesey fanatics, but for the most part what is on view is a jumble of scenes featuring pranksters getting high on grass and LSD.__Gibney and Ellwood struggle to create context for or make much sense of the vibrant hodge-podge of material that they excavated from the archives of Kesey, who died in 2001.__The movie fails to make the cross-country jaunt function as a metaphor for the country's mid-century passage. Minus that, the Pranksters' everything-changing adventure looks a lot like just another road trip.__It's fascinating and sometimes surprising stuff.__Ken Kesey decided the camera was mightier than the pen. This enjoyable but surprisingly unenlightening documentary suggests otherwise.__I'm not sure I can adequately explain the '60s to someone who wasn't there. "Magic Trip" doesn't really even try.__The backstory behind the film is as compelling as the events it depicts.__The first striking thing about the documentary is that nothing about it reads 1964.__"Magic Trip" is the cinematic equivalent of a yellowed scrapbook whose pictures are accompanied by sketchy captions created after the fact.__Magic Trip is about as fun as being the only sober person at a party.__It's like seeing the birth of the '60s, with great moments (including Neal Cassady doing speed-freak monologues).__Time to get on the bus.
The techie stuff is light and the mood mostly optimistic, which makes for a slightly bland experience.__"Revenge of the Electric Car" lacks the urgency of "Who Killed the Electric Car?" But Paine's thorough knowledge of his subject, and engaging way with an interview, make the follow-up film a fun ride.__As filmmaking goes, Paine's follow-up is a dud.__If you thought you'd never mist up at a nonfiction movie about plug-in autos, you're in for a surprise. This is a surprisingly emotional trip, and a very enjoyable one.__Once a muckraker, Paine now acts mostly as a cheerleader, and his slick new movie trades heavily in the sort of flattering CEO profiles that grace the covers of business magazines.__The first film was charged with drama. "Revenge" is somewhat anticlimactically charged with a wall plug.__The movie is interesting now and, given its subject, should even be more interesting in about a hundred years. Stick around.__More hopeful but also more complex and lacking the focused urgency of the original.__Ultimately, "Revenge of the Electric Car" is like meeting with an overeager salesman. In real life, that's not necessarily an unpleasant experience, but it also doesn't last 90 minutes.__Fascinating and highly entertaining...__Wall Street might want to take notice of how quickly tides can change.__Saying electric cars are "zero emission" is about as truthful as saying you don't have to kill a cow when you buy a hamburger.__In the end, "Revenge of the Electric Car" is a slick, enjoyable valentine to a retooling industry. This optimistic film lacks the outrage of the earlier work, but that's O.K. A movement needs its triumphs too.__Fascinating in its own right.__Anybody throwing the word revenge around right now is being a tad premature.__In lieu of a business case for ethics, it tells the story of that rare moment when the bottom line finally dovetails with the greater good.__Given Paine's penchant for B-movie-sounding titles, let's hope he gets to make it a trilogy that concludes with The Electric Car Lives!__Too many important questions are never addressed, or even asked, presumably to protect corporate secrets.__Without true tension, the docu feels as slickly manufactured as its va-va-voom subject.__This fascinating sequel provides a surprisingly upbeat prognosis on the transition to electric vehicles.
__Gun Hill Road is shot through with performances at once intense and relaxed.__Feels like it's been workshopped, from its string of coincidences to its tidy downbeat conclusion in which Green stabs at irony with a dull knife.__Before some predictable, freedom-threatening recidivism on Enrique's part, the film exhibits a simultaneously anthropological and sensitive interest in Michael's day-to-day life...__In writer-director Rashaad Ernesto Green's assured hands, "Gun Hill Road" manages somehow to be gritty, delicate, in your face and nuanced at the same time.__Tenderness and good intentions don't necessarily add up to a movie.__A coiled feeling hangs over writer-director Rashaad Ernesto Green's assured, engrossing feature film debut.__The writer and director, Rashaad Ernesto Green, relies too often on gender cliches...__The writing is predictable and off the scale in terms of trajectory. The basic plot structure never follows one idea through to resolution.__Even with the rich, inherently cinematic texture of the urban setting and two excellent native outer-borough actors in Morales and Reyes, Gun Hill Road falters thanks to its paint-by-numbers storytelling.__Though two late plot developments are borderline-contrived, Green's direction is marked by mature dramatic and aesthetic understatement.__A tired though vigorously acted story about a father confronted with a son who wants to be a girl.__Writer-director Rashaad Ernesto Green's first feature is earnest and well cast, but less involving than it should be.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
__There's a purity -- sense of righteousness and reunion and optimism -- that makes Thunder Soul galvanizing. Also, the music is smoking hot, which is pretty amazing, considering it comes from a high school band. And a bunch of oldsters.__All of the agreeable ingredients are there, but director Mark Landsman doesn't coast on the built-in feel-good factor.__Arguably, the current generation of funk and soul revivalists owes a debt to musicians who forged their astonishing sound in between Algebra study sessions.__Though it sometimes overplays the sentimentality, "Thunder Soul" gets not just the music but also the sense of possibility for this post-civil-rights generation.__A precious scrap of American history.__Thunder Soul represents a feast for the senses, a soulful celebration of the black musical renaissance of the late '60s and '70s, but the filmmakers don't seem particularly interested in peering beneath the dazzling surface.__An uplifting and entertaining film...__Warm memories of one school under a groove and a moving ending that no screenwriter could improve upon.__You may never have heard of the Kashmere Stage Band, but by the end of "Thunder Soul" you will wonder why.__In an era when arts education is frequently on the chopping block, Thunder Soul reminds us of the impact that great music can have on both the listener and the performer.__Thunder Soul has real filmmaking, real history and real pleasure in it...__Serves as a rousing testament to the singular blessings of music education, since there's nothing inherent or automatic about kids learning how to groove.__Sometimes you just can't fight the funk; as much as you might resist the film's more maudlin scenes, not succumbing to the band's signature tune, "Head Wiggle," is impossible.__A genuinely moving and powerful doc about one of the great funk bands ever, that just happened to be a high school band.__None__None__None__None__None
__The sincerity of feeling is unmistakable. So's the flat-footedness of the writing.__Emily Watson, who always brings a special grace to the screen, gives a multilayered performance to the role of Margaret Humphreys, who not only puts her own family dynamic at risk but finds herself physically threatened.__The result is a problem drama with more problem than drama.__Emily Watson, a delicate English rose, has never seemed more sturdy than here.__The most powerful sequences in the movie are the linked vignettes involving Margaret and the various grown-up children whom she attempts to help in their search for -- what, exactly? Closure? Catharsis?__Once, very early on, the secret deportations have been exposed there aren't many new places for the film to go - just more scenes of an increasingly tired-looking Emily Watson trudging around with an armful of file folders.__It's powerful, gut-wrenching stuff, and it doesn't need tarting up.__Making a true story of social injustice into a gripping narrative requires more imagination than is contained in this well-intentioned but uninspired effort.__Well-meaning but blandly executed, smothering potentially powerful scenes with earnest do-gooder-film moments.__As the story ricochets between Britain and Australia, the film often loses track of time and becomes fragmented as it struggles to integrate too many subplots. What holds it together is Ms. Watson's calm, sturdy performance.__It's all very stiff-upper-lip, when what the subject cries out for is a rant.__Sometimes the facts can get in the way of the drama, and that's the central problem here.__If larger truths have been overlooked, the subject is still wrenching enough to make Oranges and Sunshine an inspired work of dignity and purpose.__The movie belongs to Hugo Weaving and David Wenham, both playing what one newspaper dubs "the lost children of the Empire," men broken by the appalling conditions that met them in their new homeland.__Oranges and Sunshine is thrillingly efficient filmmaking.__Loach has made a film uncluttered by an obvious director's stamp, peopled by sympathetic characters and driven by a desire to say something about the world without losing sight of human experience.__Jim Loach (son of Ken Loach) has his heart in the right place for his feature debut, but a plodding script and muted staging strangely strip away the emotional punch.__A deeply moving study of emotionally scarred adults who were illegally deported as children to Australia from Britain in the 1940s and '50s.__None
The result is pretty entertaining, though most of that entertainment derives from Katz's skillful exploitation of gumshoe formula.__Katz's characters are beautifully observed, the autumnal photography of downtown Portland is lovely, and the tension is expertly maintained...__This is a slacker detective story, emphasis on the slack, and if you can downshift into its loping rhythms, it's pretty wonderful.__Cold Weather is good in so many subtle ways, I despair of doing them justice.__Just at the point of losing its audience, a nifty little film suddenly emerges.__The world's first mumblecore ''thriller" - a good idea for a movie that someone, in the future, should execute a bit less lackadaisically.__Almost a textbook example of how to do more with less. It's about aimless people who suddenly find their aim.__Something finally happens about 40 minutes into Aaron Katz's amiably low-key feature.__...Cold Weather is a lot more than a well-observed but meager mood piece. It's a seemingly enigmatic but ultimately fully realized and generous cinematic experience.__The movie is like a butterfly half out of its cocoon, emerging with many fond looks back to the protective walls.__"Cold Weather" is much less interested in providing a satisfying mystery than dwelling on the quirks of its aimless and awkward protagonist -- anyone unwilling to go along risks severe boredom.__With only the most natural of conversations and an exacting relay of close-ups, intimate two shots and meditative landscapes, Mr. Katz reveals how the self-knowing individual becomes known to others, and me turns into we.__The movie does have a charm that develops gradually.__The fact that the stakes end up being ridiculously low doesn't matter. That's just one more appealing element of the film's unconventional intrigue.__Not a riff on mystery stories so much as it is a riff, pure and simple, on the mystery of stories.__Ambitious, if not always satisfying.__Pic represents considerable progress for Katz, a founding member of the mumblecore movement.__None__None__None
Questionable motives and unbelievable decisions are relatively small potatoes compared with the Sputnik-size plotholes.__Like a stripper who gets naked too quickly, the lukewarm spy thriller "The Double" lays out its big plot twist early in the movie - and soon finds, shivering, that it has nowhere else to go.__When the story starts to fall apart you're left wondering if the film was worth all the money and effort that went into making it.__It's simply not very good.__Ineptly realized in everything but its chase scenes (which are, I'll admit, pretty good).__Here is a movie constructed from basic parts at the Used Screenplay Store, with a character plugged in whenever one is required.__The story makes no sense and leads nowhere but into a creaky buddy movie that can't round itself off without a last-minute hero falling on his sword to save another.__It soon devolves into a mess of slit throats and competing motives. Everyone, it seems, has a plot - except the screenwriters.__What can you say about a dull spy thriller that gives away its big "secret'' both in its trailer and the film's title?__If these characters ever had a motivation for their extreme behavior, it disappeared in rewrites.__A tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving Russian double and triple agents.__There's a sanded-off, textbook creativity to "The Double" that forsakes rich cloak-and-dagger textures for generic twists, hackneyed flashbacks and telegraphed moments of peril.__The twist in The Double slack mystery-thriller is revealed with a shrug about a third of the way in. After that, it's all about Gere looking grim, and Grace looking stricken as he learns what we already know.__Roughly 99 percent of the time, if a movie that seems like it should be a big deal appears almost out of the blue, it's because it's lousy. The Double doesn't exactly buck that trend.__Like a Training Day for spy thrillers, The Double provocatively pairs Gere and Grace as a gray-green odd couple, only to unravel as the double-crossed absurdities pile up and the duo start trading bad Russian accents in a private Mexican standoff.__Rarely has Mr. Gere walked through any movie with so little energy and so much indifference.__Whether it's the clumsy use of flashbacks, the air of manufactured portentousness, or the completely unbelievable casting of Grace in a role that requires a certain authority utterly lacking in the actor's performance, almost every move seems a misstep.__A barely warm dish of Cold War leftovers that shows its hand too early, then works itself into an increasingly implausible tangle of knotty plot developments without ever mustering much intensity.__None__None
There's smooth-jazz polish to the emotions, even the unpleasant ones, in "I Will Follow."__I Will Follow, Ava DuVernay's triumphant feature debut, is a life-affirming portrait of a woman, Maye (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), juggling all kinds of loss.__This touching if insular drama about a woman grieving over the recent death of her aunt is well acted and incisively observed, although it's ultimately too low-key to have much dramatic impact.__Shows a certain amount of promise but often falls prey to easy emotional beats and an overall sentimentality when it should push for moments less obvious, more rare, true and insightful.__As a director, DuVernay handles her actors with care, though visually the picture sometimes betrays its shoestring budget.__In one way or another, every emotion in this wonderful independent film is one I've experienced myself. Grief, of course. But also anger, loneliness, confusion and a sense of lost direction.__Its elegantly simple structure filled in with startling, understated force, I Will Follow is a modestly framed portrait of grief in its first season.__The soulful, messy process of grief gets a soulful, messy treatment in Ava DuVernay's I Will Follow.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The Revolution will not be televised, Gil Scott-Heron once sang. Nor should it be filmed, we might add -- at least not as a costume drama with stirring speeches, an inspirational love story and gloriously heroic military charges.__Earnest and studious to a fault. Rarely has a film about upheaval felt more like a textbook.__May be slow going for anyone not well-versed in this chapter of Chinese history.__Packed with so many characters and subtitled history lessons it barely allows its excellent main cast room to maneuver.__What should be rousing stuff - a republic is born! the chains of feudalism thrown off! - remains a kind of lavishly illustrated history lesson.__With "1911,'' art direction speaks louder than words.__1911 serves too many masters for its own good.__Corny, preachy and tedious.__The revolutionaries who fought to free China from nearly 3,000 years of dynastic oppression deserve a worthier cinematic monument than 1911.__If the success of epic storytelling were determined by the sheer number of unnecessary on-screen name tags, 1911 would be a masterpiece.

A well-meaning but ploddingly earnest after-school special...__"Life, Above All" earns the tears it inspires. The film is about deep human emotions, evoked with sympathy and love.__Perseverance is the theme of "Life, Above All," a drama that is deeply affecting, if also overwhelmingly bleak.__There is less in-your-face grit in Cape Town-born director Oliver Schmitz's vision for this film than there is a careful pacing of somber revelations.__In such a bleak story, the redemptive ending seems rushed and unconvincing, but director Oliver Schmitz has sent us a timely dispatch from a forgotten corner of the world that is honest above all.__This is a heartening story of resilience told without false uplift. It is hopeful without being mawkish, realistic but not oppressive.__"Life, Above All," a deeply moving South African drama about AIDS and ostracism, manages to be, paradoxically, both austere and uplifting.__If [its] allegorical underpinnings blur the film's edges, the performances bring it back into focus.__Manyaka gives the character a gaze so true it could only open hearts and minds.__A wrenching and powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of a remorseless disease and societal prejudice.__Nicely splits the difference between ethnographic realism and melodramatic uplift.__The fluidity of Schmitz's technique reflects a world in which tragedy and uplift are inextricably commingled.__The script groans beneath a mass of symbolic winking and declamatory exposition that has the unfortunate effect of turning the villagers into credulous simpletons, ready to blow with any wind that carries them.__Newcomer Manyaka, who as Chanda carries the family's burdens on her slender shoulders, is compelling -- she always seems to be leaning forward, ready to walk head first into her next battle.__That tragedy is the real point of "Life, After All." And if the film makes people think about that problem, that's a good thing.__The movie stares clear-eyed at a world where any kind of hope seems like a dream.__A downer that too often resorts to melodrama.__This is a modest film, and an affecting one.__Does something that few painful dramas accomplish: It tells a tale of resilience without platitudes about the triumph of the human spirit or without false promises about an unclouded future.__The director and his splendid cast assure that this tale about a strong little girl fighting to keep her family alive and together has both high art and a big heart, audience appeal and gut impact.
Tomboy is a lovely reminder that the French have long been famous for a quite different sort of film-about children.__Brisk, precisely observed, and bracingly non-preachy in its examination of a very tricky subject.__Writer and director Celine Sciamma adorns the thorny dilemma with resonant allusions to gender roles...__Modestly conceived and executed.__"Tomboy" is tender and affectionate.__"Tomboy," a brief and sweetly refreshing French film, is the story of a lie.__Sciamma pictures the story in dappled sunlight and wooded fields that, though not far from dull apartment blocks, have an out-of-time seductiveness.__Open-minded and open-ended, Tomboy is a portrait of pubescence on the brink of chrysalis.__There are nevertheless some marvelous moments.__Coming-of-age tale tackles gender confusion with humor and heart.__Tomboy reveals a side of pre-adolescence rarely (if ever) depicted on the big screen, yet it never feels like a curiosity piece, nor is Laure (Zoe Heran), the titular character, portrayed as an outsider from a troubled home.__Sciamma (Water Lilies) deserves great praise for what she has accomplished with a simple film addressing a complex subject.__"Tomboy'' is as visually beautiful as its 10-year-old heroine is defiantly plain.__Quiet and naturalistic in the best way, the French film "Tomboy" rolls out a tale of malleable pre-adolescent identity with a marked absence of sensationalism.__Sciamma has wound back the clock to childhood to show us, with taste and sensitivity, something we have not seen.__Its young heroine is proud to be herself; there's just not much for her to do beyond that.__There's an absolute naturalism to all the performances here. That's crucial, especially from Heran, who's playing a character who does not yet know herself.__A beautiful, matter-of-fact French drama about a young girl who wants to be a boy - and for one singular summer around her 10th birthday passes as one...__Two feature films into her career, writer-director Celine Sciamma has proven unusually skilled at making short, plot-light movies about budding adolescents discovering themselves.__Sciamma draws wonderfully natural performances from her young cast, and doesn't shy away from an uncomfortable or pensive silence.
A remorseless catalogue of calculated violence, casual cannibalism and sexual sadism, this inflicts over two hours of suffering on the audience...__This is the stuff of nightmares, where even the good guy is bad, and as shock cinema goes, it packs a punch.__We lucky westerners get to see it in all its hair-raising, stomach-churning glory, and that's a wonderful thing.__A terrific but uncompromising film that's definitely not for everyone. It's not just that the violence is graphic, but that much of it is so mean-spirited.__After a while, the sheer length and repetitiousness of the film begins to feel pornographic in the dullest sense.__Director Kim Jee-woon is a born filmmaker, even if this script (written by Park Hoon Jung and adapted by Kim) is unworthy of his efforts.__As revenge fantasy, "I Saw the Devil'' is clever. As comedy, it's sick. As moviegoing, it's tedious...__When it comes to bloody revenge movies, it's difficult to beat the South Koreans.__Even at its most chaotic, the film never loses sight of the human toll of the increasingly over-the-top events it portrays.__A droll Nietzschean fable that's fully aware of its lapses into absurdity.__Kim goes to ever-nastier extremes with I Saw The Devil, but he also extends the revenge theme into a mesmerizing study of the nature of evil itself.__Somewhere in all the blood (sickening realism is a selling point), a question is posed: When does the one fighting a monster become a monster himself?__The savagery is honest, raw and hardly entertainment.__Never good with nuance, Kim is a beast with disarming imagery (like the severed head that turns face-up in a river current) but has few resonating ideas, leaving the domino-tumble of brutality to become its own tiresome spectacle.__On any number of levels, Devil is troublesome at best, offensive at worst.__None__None__None__None__None
Well crafted and flat-out cool.__Director Vincent Morisset captures the band in dreamy, grainy, black-and-white images that slide and blur in a way that suggests David Lynch.__The best concert films achieve a marriage of sound and image that feels effortlessly harmonious, and in that regard "Inni," a musical portrait of the Icelandic band Sigur Ros, leaves most of its genre in the dust.__At a time when most U.S. music documentaries have devolved into either artist-endorsed EPKs or predictable Behind the Music-style fables of redemption, it's refreshing to see state-sponsored artists still flying the flag for the rock film as an art film.__The music of Iceland's Sigur Ros fills the cinema, as if reverberating off the walls of some darkly beautiful fjord.__You see the beads of sweat, the grimaces of concentration, the rapturous moments.__Sigur Ros fans are intensely devoted -- lore describes people passing out at shows in some sort of overwhelmed, ecstatic state -- and "Inni" finally gives some sense of why and how that might happen.__The soul-stirring fusion of joy and heartache that burns like a current through the music of Sigur Ros comes through loud and clear in Inni.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
__[A] thoughtful and elegantly made documentary.__The picture is as grim as the wasteland that remains after the "mountain top removal" process undertaken by coal companies to reveal the rich seams of coals that lie underneath.__The film presents a devastatingly airtight, dramatic argument.__When you see a 91-year-old woman in a flag-draped wheelchair arrested for daring to challenge Massey's policies at the governor's office, you can't help but feel you're witnessing an American tragedy.__The coal industry's tactics are appalling. But to a lesser extent so is this.__A film like "The Last Mountain" fills me with restless anger.__The Last Mountain will make you very, very angry.__The disturbing eco-documentary "The Last Mountain" charts the catastrophic effects of the mining technique called mountaintop removal on West Virginia's Coal River Valley.__A damning look at Big Coal and its landscape-decimating practices, a litany of disheartening statistics and enraging testimony.__The protests and lawsuits organized by lifelong locals are inspiring.__I left the movie convinced that we have to break our addiction to coal-generated electricity before it's too late, but not at all convinced that our soul-gnawed, endlessly distracted nation possesses the strength of character or political will to do so.__When the film suggests that wind farms atop the mountains are the answer while backing higher taxes on such energy, which is more expensive than coal in the first place, it demonstrates its lack of interest in market reality.__The black heart of coal country - and, as the film shows, our national energy debate - has never seemed so in need of white knights.__The film does a good job of breaking down the complex interplay among politics, coal and environmentalists, including how and why the Clean Water Act has become more lax in recent years.__Is there anything more disheartening than a lousy documentary pushing a good cause?__A familiar if nonetheless enraging slab of agitprop.__[The film] confirms every awful suspicion ever raised about the coal industry. Trouble is, the news is so bad and so plentiful that The Last Mountain may have you looking for the nearest exit instead of a way to register your outrage.__Delivers a powerful environmental punch.__Director and co-writer Bill Haney lacks a sense of poetry about the documentary form and opts for something closer to a sledgehammer approach.
It is not an easy film, and perhaps a touch too relentless, but it is a great reminder of how bloody, mad and awful this world can be.__Lu Chuan makes this feature film soar by telling the story both through the eyes of the Japanese occupiers and the defenseless Chinese civilians in the ancient capital. It makes the savagery all the more senseless.__Exquisitely shot in black and white, with a rare attention to detail and dramatic complexity, "City of Life and Death" is a timelessly great film that commands our collective attention.__In almost any form, the story of the Nanking atrocities can leave you profoundly shaken. But Lu Chuan's version may be the most compassionate and emotionally satisfying treatment to date.__Here, in bloodless miniature, is the true obscenity of war.__Lu tells the heartbreaking, nearly unbearable story with compassion, controlled fury and unflinching realism.__It's a film strong enough to change your life, if you can bear to watch it at all.__This is hardly a film to recommend as entertainment. As an act of remembrance, though, it is singular and, in its way, soaring.__It's a muscular, physical movie, pieced together from arresting imagery and revelatory gestures, large and small.__Lu does more with the first 50 minutes than some directors accomplish in 10 movies.__Lu Chuan's powerful epic City Of Life And Death threads the needle beautifully, capturing the breadth of the slaughter and barbarism without dehumanizing either side.__Lu's distinction lies in the cinematic virtuosity he brings to orchestrating carnage, the calculated attention he pays to human interest, and the globalist, universalizing attitude inherent in both.__Directed by Lu Chuan, it's a fascinating film, and an unusual entry in the current Chinese cinema.__One should remember Schindler's List, and the off-putting way beauty hung in the throat alongside evil.__The horrors it represents can be almost too difficult to watch, yet you keep watching because Mr. Lu makes the case that you must.__The torments endured by the Chinese don't need Lu's lapel-grabbing tactics...__None__None__None__None
An exercise in sober drama and a middle-class cautionary tale which explores a family ripped up by the roots after the rape of a 14-year-old girl.__Audiences most definitely will squirm and wish they were anywhere but in the theater, despite the fact that it features some of Clive Owen's best work and a startling movie debut by the 15-year-old Liana Liberato.__What Trust conveys, at its best, is that ultimately parental protections are not foolproof, and that is the greatest horror of all.__Schwimmer directs this smarmy Hot Topic drama with empathy for the craft of acting but less interest in the craft of making a movie move.__Prurient, ham-handed and amateurish.__I must admit [Schwimmer's] done a solid job with this queasy drama.__The script is blaring and obvious at all times, and in his second directorial effort, David Schwimmer doesn't have a clue how dull it is for the audience to endure scene after scene of anguish, crying and screaming matches.__There is no denying that Schwimmer knows something about getting a performance out of an actor. Liberato, who is 15 now, is flat-out terrific.__The mantle of social relevance can be a heavy one, but "Trust," a smooth drama about a girl's seduction and rape by a middle-aged Internet predator, is neither preachy nor hysterically overreaching.__Unfortunately, this well-acted cautionary tale is hampered by a lack of visual finesse and a script (by Andy Bellin and Robert Festinger) in need of a narrative rethink and a dialogue polish.__The claustrophobic film offers a strange anti-catharsis; it's all tension and frustration with no crowd-pleasing release.__It's easy to imagine how this story could have been exploited and dumbed down. It works instead with intelligence and sympathy.__He's adept with actors, but Schwimmer has yet to locate his strengths behind the camera.__Afterschool Special stuff, but the ensemble rings quite true in their coping processes, as director David Schwimmer proves adept at tracking rogue emotions that no closing Ordinary People clench can satisfactorily resolve.__Actor-helmer David Schwimmer makes an ill-advised shift into Afterschool Special territory with his sophomore feature, Trust.__This theme is well-drawn, and the film plays out with great intensity as Owen's character grapples with the fact that the daughter he loves might have changed forever.__None__None__None__None
If there's an undercurrent of impending cataclysm in today's culture, 'Kaboom' senses that feeling, seizes it in a surreal clinch and hurtles with it off a cliff.__Designed to have its own fun, filled to the brim with bangs of all kinds but mostly landing with a whimper.__What pop spectacle!__The film is Araki's most ambitious to date, with a quick pace, music that's hip and cool and a mood that alternates between playful and eccentric.__All that's truly strange here though is that Araki gets so few jolts or laughs from this hodge-podge of genres.__Araki deserves credit for maintaining his independent spirit. But "Kaboom" is short on impact.__With Kaboom, Araki takes a huge step backward from the maturity and restraint he demonstrated in 2004's Mysterious Skin, his best and most-assured film to date (and, tellingly, his only adaptation of someone else's material).__The fact that the characters spout snappy, profane dialogue while all this is, or isn't, going on around them is more "fun" than fun; Araki's like the too-drunk guy who won't go home when the party's over.__What's going on? Who cares?__Araki has been making movies for more than 20 years now, and his ideas haven't evolved all that much.__"Kaboom'' is currently having all the sex other American comedies are too shy and too commercial for.__Sort of likable, despite Araki's utter lack of interest in charming anyone who isn't already a member of his small following.__This isn't satire, it isn't that funny and the only bits that work are the titillating ones.__Much of the film seems to make no sense, and when all is finally resolved, it feels arbitrary and pointless.__The movie has been cast, designed, clothed, scored and edited to the bleeding edge of hip, but it hasn't exactly been written.__Sexy, dark, occasionally funny, good performances--but it's just too stupid to recommend.__The film is so disjointed and chaotic that the usual pleasures of Araki's films-which arise from the freedom that his lost boys enjoy-never take hold.__Araki lets his absurdist imagination run wild, and "Kaboom" takes the time-honored gambit of gradually revealing that nothing is as it seems to delightfully cockamamie extremes.__Kaboom might be borderline camp, but there's no spillover. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Perhaps Araki's vision of human sexuality is so fluid that the borders are always expanding.__Kaboom is an erotic blast of sinful flesh, fun and fantasy that you don't want to stop.
Celine Danhier combines talking heads with a flood of Super-8 and 16-millimeter film clips to create this entertaining 2010 documentary about the explosion of punk energy that propelled New York City's art, music, and cinema underground.__As maddeningly undisciplined as the movie community she's exploring, but it still stands as a worthy historical document of NYC's recent past and the birth of a new way of making films.__As well as unearthing flavourful clips from films only determined cineastes have seen (War Is Menstrual Envy, You Killed Me First), French filmmaker Celine Danhier has reassembled many of the era's crucial players.__This doc is interesting and worthy, but it is unlikely to send you seeking most of the films sampled in it. That was then, this is now, and it was fun while it lasted.__The biggest shortcoming of "Blank City" is that, despite its vivid portrait of the time period, we never get much sense of what the actual movies are like.__Above all, the film is a poignant valentine to an era when artists could afford to live and work on the island of Manhattan, and the cultural ferment goosed by their low-rent lifestyle.__The real reason to see Blank City is to catch snatches of the now-decades-old films - priceless DIY numbers that capture all the wild energy, humor, and rage of, if not a more innocent time, then certainly a cooler one.__"Blank City" shows a succession of engaging, intelligent, middle-aged people showing some very bad home movies that they once hoped were something more.__The doc flags toward the end, but it remains an absorbing snapshot of a daring time.__"Blank City'' can't help but feel a little unfocused ... and it definitely isn't sure where to call it quits, but it's there for the moments that matter.__Though the area was filled with crime, drugs and derelict buildings, [the Lower East Side] nurtured a vibrant underground film scene.__Anyone who bemoans the gentrification of New York will revel in Celine Danhier's love letter to a long-ago city, back in the late '70s.__In the abstract, this story's been told before. But in its particulars, Blank City is long overdue.__Nothing in this assemblage of clips will convince anyone not already sold on the enduring artistic importance of these movements beyond the world bounded by 14th Street and the Holland Tunnel.__Blank City is more than just a correlative correction; it's a complementary portrait of how, just like Blondie, Basquiat et al., these wasteland mavericks created their own zeitgeist out of urgent desperation and urban decay.__Somehow Ms. Danhier manages to conjure a glorious and grungy bygone past without fetishizing it as a golden age.__Often feels as inchoate as the phenomenon under discussion.__A well-researched celebration of No Wave cinema in all its grainy Super-8 glory.__None__None
The production design and costumes are immaculate, while Ruiz's camera glides around soirees, ducks under tables and peers from behind curtains.__A sumptuous unravelling of secrets wrapped in tantalizing stories that gradually interconnect the lives of an ensemble of characters who seduce, betray and defend each other in the years surrounding the Peninsular War.__Based on the sprawling 19th-century novel by Camilo Castelo Branco, Chilean director Raul Ruiz renders an equally sprawling tale filled with love and war, violence and vengeance and the search for identity.__This isn't one of those epics that uses length as a bludgeon. Rather than sweep, the movie spirals, twisting its viewpoint to reveal tales within tales.__A sprawling 19th century novel filtered through the mind of a trickster filmmaker, the late Raul Ruiz, who both delights in and subverts his wildly complex and melodramatic source material.__It's a lot. But if you're at all inclined, it's just right.__Despite the running time (an even longer version was broadcast on Portuguese TV), the movie is never sluggish; on the contrary, it's smart, energetic filmmaking that also makes for engrossing entertainment.__I got a little lost while watching "Mysteries of Lisbon" and enjoyed the experience.__The casual way [Ruiz] practices difficult cinema is breathtaking.__The storytelling is straightforward, with a classical sheen, even as mischief and hallucination puncture the serene surface.__You can study it, like a painting, and then realize, with a gasp, that it has got hold of you like a fever.__[Ruiz] stages the events with an air of intrigue that's amplified by his sly, insistently roving camera and his sinuous, theatrical long takes.__The story is nothing if not convoluted. Characters, subplots and overlapping narratives come and go.__It's telling that the movie, after reaching a tidy payoff, takes one last spin into an epilogue that questions the actuality of almost everything that's come before.__A dull, high-minded soap opera.__Once you start to ride with the rapturous, gorgeous, digressive symphony of images and words and music in this film it's completely absorbing and unlike anything you've ever seen.__Made for European television and originally divided into six one-hour episodes, the movie now runs an absorbing, astonishingly fast four and a quarter hours.__For all its visual invention and full-blooded melodrama, Mysteries Of Lisbon never tilts to full-on crazy.__A boy in a Lisbon orphanage wonders about his origins, and in response a river of stories flows from the mouths of noblemen, ladies, low-born scoundrels, priests, and sinners.__An impossible-to-summarize narrative that has, among other things, a love triangle, several flashbacks and a rude gypsy called the Knife-Eater.
An intermittently entertaining comedy/drama with a funny script and a fatal miscasting.__Go for Caan and Farmiga, and stay to be surprised by Reeves.__What's needed is someone nervous to play Henry. A Steve Buscemi, for example. Reeves maintains a sort of Zen detachment.__A felony of a movie ... tedious and improbable...__If "Henry's Crime'' is occasionally too pleased with itself, it's also pleasantly unpredictable, and it has a trio of sweet hambone performances at its center.__The film's ungainly mix of heist, romance and backstage comedy never jells.__"Henry's Crime" is a movie that eschews the details and tries to get by on charm, and it does have charm - just not enough to get by.__Keanu Reeves gives an adroit turn in this pleasantly deadpan caper.__Reeves seems more laid-back than loser - it's hard to accept him as someone who has let half of his adult life go to waste without minding, or even noticing.__Though the movie has some engagingly quirky moments, everything falls into place far too easily for much suspense to build, and the romance between the two leads seems as contrived as everything else.__Its mood is so muffled and point so submerged, it's difficult to see why Mr. Reeves and the rest of the cast pooled their talents to make a movie about a nowhere man going no place in particular in Buffalo.__It's a grating muddle, typified by Reeves as a protagonist who's so frustratingly vapid that even the other characters seem baffled at his blankness.__It's a &#8232; grab bag of comic cliches about bank robberies and regional theater.__Henry's Crime has a little too much in common with its aimless namesake.__You wish anyone on either side of the camera had a cup of coffee and then the energy to throw out weak scenes and flawed motivations while picking up the pace.__Close but no cigar.__Farmiga radiates warmth and Caan hasn't had a role this meaty since 'Misery'. A quiet triumph.__Mixing a bank raid with a stage romp becomes just too silly.__Part of what makes Henry such a frustrating hero is how little he reveals of his emotions.__None
Your enjoyment of French filmmaker Quentin's Dupieux's movie depends in large part on your capacity to enjoy the absurd. I enjoyed it quite a bit.__Rubber will undoubtedly be the best film about a round, hollow serial killer released this year.__If "Rubber'' was half as smart as it is clever, we might be talking gonzo midnight four-star classic here.__"Rubber" is a silly thing. But it doesn't stop at silly.__More a deadpan art provocation than a real movie, Rubber is spun out like a musical theme through a series of variations.__Goofily amusing for 85 minutes, and a fitting B-feature to the E.T. comedy "Paul."__An exercise in horrific absurdity that is neither as scary nor as amusing as it hopes to be.__Picture Monty Python writ ing an unusually odd "Twilight Zone" episode directed by surrealist Luis Bunuel. Or just empty your mind of all sense: This is "Rubber."__Either of the film's sides - the horror comedy or the post-modernist commentary - probably wouldn't be enough to sustain the movie on its own. But with both facets taken together, writer/director Quentin Dupieux can have his cake and deconstruct it too.__"Rubber" has anthropomorphic, head-scratching fun with its gory B-movie trappings, silly music cues, self-referential comedy and deliberately off-kilter acting.__By embracing irrationality as his operating principle (or at least by pretending to), Mr. Dupieux lets himself off the narrative hook.__While it's admirably perverse for a "killer-tire movie" to be this snooty, it's about half as clever as it thinks it is.__The potshots made at horror film audiences, and/or film audiences in general, are ... slipshod.__Pic offers auds few reasons to want to see it beyond its one-joke premise.__Nobody's safe -- least of all moviegoers -- with a killer tire on the loose.__An essay on storytelling and spectatorship within When Inanimate Objects Attack schlock -- one infused with the haunting aura and disillusionment of a post-Easy Rider road movie -- Rubber is some kind of miracle.__A strikingly clever parody of bloody road thrillers of the nineteen-seventies...__None__None__None
The pace is quick, the violence is rough, and the visual style is documentary as Padilha hammers home his point: Someone is forever in the pocket of someone else as The System constantly adapts to protect itself.__When this Enemy Within settles into key action sequences, such as a stunning nighttime ambush or a daytime battle against Fabio, it becomes wildly entertaining.__Throttles forward with remarkable aplomb and easily leaves the original in the dust.__Elite Squad is just urgent and complex enough to make it clear violence is more than a matter for academic debate.__A fast-paced, hard-hitting Brazilian police thriller.__Jammed with cliches but completely engrossing.__Here's a Brazilian thriller that's so angry and specifically political, it's hard to believe they got away with making it.__There is a deep sense of indignation at the core of The Enemy Within, a righteous fury that pelts every cog of "the system" like machine-gun fire.__It resembles a flow chart splattered with blood and spittle, more static and smeary in tone than the finger-pointing corrective director-cowriter Jose Padilha intended.__No wonder Padilha's been tapped to helm a Hollywood reboot of "RoboCop.''__Padilha's style is so urgent and immediate that you almost feel like you're in the midst of an especially advanced video game.__The carnage, although explicit and frequent, is not grotesquely overdone.__Moving to its own throbbing beat, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within offers an exhilaratingly bleak vision of what it describes as "an articulation of loathsome interests," in which the well-meaning suffer...__Our hero's prominence sets up a stellar conclusion that retroactively questions both the first movie and its substantial audience.__Its conviction makes it tough to dismiss.__A thumping modern policier with a social-conscience edge.__None__None__None__None
__'Last Night' is an empty exercise in sheer self-regard, a tedious, lifeless trawl through the secret lives of the rich and beautiful.__Forget about sex or adultery -- there isn't enough life in Last Night.__Tadjedin banks on the power of telling, familiar moments, betting that viewers will recognize the heartache at the center of a fleeting expression or hurried action. For the most part, her gamble pays off.__It's the sort of movie that thinks cutting between two different stories makes it art. Usually, it feels like an exercise in art. There's a lot of calisthenics but very little beauty or truth or whatever it is the movie is going for.__Will Michael succumb and prove Joanna correct in her suspicions? Will Alex's French accent conquer all? Do you care? I didn't.__Massy Tadjedin's intimate directorial debut takes a spare, thoughtful approach to relationships.__Tadjedin shows an intimate understanding of how couples communicate through ellipses and of all that remains unsaid even amid torrents of angry words.__Suspenseful though it is, the movie is quiet to the point of being sleepy, and Worthington is simply not working out as a screen star.__He's withheld and she's, frankly, grating. So we don't really care if they weather the current storm, because sooner or later they're bound to get divorced, anyway.__It's hard to care about the fate of a marriage that never quite comes into focus.__The will-they-or-won't-they structure is a bit facile, but Last Night is on to something fascinating.__It's a quiet, contemplative film that reminded me of Mike Nichols' Closer, with too many shots of lighting cigarettes and looking pensive in train windows, but I liked it.__A kinder, chicer Adrian Lyne movie.__Here, as in a cosmetics ad, the performers are assigned to telegraph desire as characters defined by visual stereotype, their empty chatter decorated with facile metaphors.__Tastefully provocative, ultimately haunting.__The real question, is who cares?__None__None__None
__The next chapter in Laura's story might be something worth rooting for, but here's hoping she has a different writer penning her lines.__A Little Help doesn't dazzle, and you can pick at its parts, but Fischer's performance gives the movie a sense of romantic weariness that lingers. Life is a series of disasters to be weathered, no matter how cute you are.__The film suffers from an uncertain tone, playing serious situations for laughs while supplying Laura with a drinking habit and a hair-trigger temper that come across as problems rather than endearing foibles.__This is one of the smarter, more honest scripts to be filmed in quite some time. And Jenna Fischer gives one of the smarter, more honest - and vulnerable, and tough - performances by an actress on the big screen in an even longer stretch.__It's not that Jenna Fischer is miscast in "A Little Help.'' It's that she's mis-everything else: misused, misdirected, misanthropic.__"A Little Help" settles for familiar and modest payoffs. It's not much. Yet Fischer clearly relishes the chance to play someone who's a demurely reckless mess.__It's manipulative, yes, but clever and persuasive in its manipulations.__It's no disaster, just OK, with Fischer boosting it a notch or two from what it otherwise would be.__That this is small comedy is fine. That it doesn't have a single big laugh is a little tiresome.__It finds its footing in a morose but funny reflection of life upended.__With a little help from films like this, Fischer could trade her small-screen fame for multiplex stardom.__File this one in the same category of edgy Long Island comedies as the equally smart 2008 Alec Baldwin film "Lymelife."__If the film takes too long to reach its rather soft denouement, Fischer makes Laura's awakening convincing.__Though the enjoyable prickliness of the film's early scenes soon dissolves into cozy solutions, a sturdy supporting cast - even Ron Leibman's scenery-chewing turn as Laura's blowhard father is more amusing than annoying - balances the scales.__A lackluster, weirdly paced and ultimately dull story of a woman in crisis - played for laughs, except there aren't any.__A Little Help doesn't settle for the dark comedy it should have been.__It's difficult to figure out exactly where the film might be heading at any given point, since it follows the loping, meandering rhythms and casualness of a character study rather than conforming to the conventions of any particular genre.__Fischer's performance is sweet and subtle, but the film can be so understated in tone and plot that it's hard to tell if it's actually saying anything.__Ultimately, the film is best appreciated as a welcome big-screen starring vehicle for Fischer, who expertly navigates the comedic and dramatic demands of a role that keeps her onscreen for virtually the entire running time.
__The story and settings hold interest throughout, but at times the very lack of emotional connection that Yeshi laments in his father seems to hinder the film.__"My Reincarnation" is a fascinating, if inexpertly told, yarn.____Buddhism teaches patience, and you're going to need it if you attempt to sit through the conciliatory bromides of the slow documentary "My Reincarnation."__Languid and contemplative, the film is typical of the intimate, paired-down aspect of Fox's style, a documentary in which lives accumulate in small moments.__"My Reincarnation" makes a pretty strong case: when the family business is enlightenment, listen to your dad.__It's fascinating to watch Yeshi grow from a skeptical teenager into a spiritual leader -- a transformation that still doesn't bring him any closer to his father.__Fox's briskness leaves certain questions gaping open.

Directors Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas work wonders with the old photos, animating and enhancing them to simulate Hicks' excellent adventure.__Ultimately, the doc comes off as yet another reminder that, in showbiz and elsewhere, one of the greatest tragedies in life is unfulfilled promise.__A portrait of the short-lived artist that will move fans while letting the uninitiated witness enough onstage highlights to leave them wanting more.__In the stand-up world, to be a cerebral comic in America is to invite anonymity. In his short life, Bill Hicks extended that invitation and, more or less, it was accepted.__Posthumous albums and now this film are securing his legacy and enduring influence.__The movie's appeal extends to the manner of its construction; it's an almost hypnotic kind of hybrid animation in which hundreds of photographs of Hicks in various poses and at various stages in his life are grafted onto two-dimensional backgrounds.__Recounts a bright-burning life while leaving us mostly in the dark.__It's heavy on facts, but short on insight -- a surface-level look at a performer of extraordinary depth.__Like Man In The Moon, American applies a thick gloss of reverence and sentimentality to the story of a comic pioneer who made his living challenging the kinds of neat, convenient, slickly packaged narratives presented here.__Hicks's shtick is so good and his life so ordinary that it's hard to escape the feeling that we might've been better off just watching a compilation of the groundbreaking funnyman's work.__Even those who shrug at his combative style of humour won't be able to deny that this is a model of detailed and distanced biographical filmmaking.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
__What makes Exporting Raymond more than just a funny sketchbook are its insights into the mutability of comedy.__The culture clash that ensues is so fascinating that Exporting Raymond nearly succeeds despite itself.__If (and only if) you need to know every detail about how the Russian version of "Everybody Loves Raymond" was put together, drop everything to see "Exporting Raymond."__"Exporting Raymond" is interesting, and even enjoyable, precisely because of the Russians, whose lives and work Mr. Rosenthal generously portrays alongside his own neuroses.__There are no grand insights, but in all the fretting and frustration, the filmmaker cracks a window into the new Russian soul, albeit a tiny one.__I mean no disrespect to Rosenthal when I say I laughed louder during the movie than during any episode of his hit TV show.__The caricature of the crass American producer who kicks the art out of a production has become a comic cliche, but Phil Rosenthal's documentary Exporting Raymond flips the script.__In the best sitcom-fueled tradition, Rosenthal is most interested in Rosenthal.

The film may be of greatest interest to those already familiar with Trungpa.

In Beautiful Boy, the themes are vast but the picture is small, and the ensuing emptiness is what the characters are meant to feel -- not us.__An excruciating drama about a couple caught in the aftermath of a pivotal moment involving their college-age son.__At a certain point lofty objectivity is just a refusal to engage, and no raw camera work can disguise it.__Most of "Beautiful Boy" is unrelentingly bleak and depressing, but there are smatterings of understatement and grace.__This feels like a movie that won a high school current-events contest: Take a tragedy, make a movie.__Ku focuses on the effects the aftermath has on those intimately involved, and they are grim.__Ku gives us the shooter's parents' view of the tragedy and it is just as devastating as anything we can imagine among victims' families.__The most daring aspect of the film, fully realized in Bello's grave performance, may be the notion that a parent can invest endless love in a child and one day find him unfathomable.__If the key performances in "Beautiful Boy" were any less honest, the film's half-formed suppositions would undo it utterly.__Beautiful Boy is not an entertainment but an experience. And a kind of cinematic sensitivity training.__A film like this can end honestly in only one way, and Ku is true to it.__There is, however, despite the intensity of the acting, an obviousness to the scenes as they play out in what often feels like real time.__Painfully perceptive and relentlessly raw, this intimate observation of a couple in extremis plays out with such subdued intensity that, by the end, audiences will very likely feel as wrung out as its embattled stars.__Great drama makes you think you're looking into other people's lives. "Beautiful Boy" makes you think you're merely peeking in their windows.__Actors are left with too much time to play emotional symphonies, while inevitably having to hit too many required notes.__The relentlessly grim "Beautiful Boy" ends up being an endurance test.__I suspect parents will react more strongly to this movie than non-parents. It's hard to imagine anyone, however, leaving the theater without a more thoughtful perspective.__Out of a premise horrifically familiar from tragedies at Columbine and Virginia Tech director Shawn Ku has crafted a film that will haunt you for a good long time.__"Beautiful Boy" tiptoes into a minefield, where it loses its nerve and remains frozen in its tracks, too timid to find a way back.__A claustrophobic, punishingly intense, beautifully measured exploration of the depths of human despair.
The Sarkozy story glistens, snakelike.__The dialogue is punchy, but the film lacks visual personality, and the insights into Sarkozy and France as a whole don't cut very deep.__"The Conquest" is like a French restaurant that serves small portions of tart appetizers and calls them freedom fries, yet begrudgingly we must salute the gall.__Too often ... the jaunty, overeager background music seems to be underscoring jokes the action doesn't provide.__Sarkozy seems to mean exactly what he says, even when he's lying for his cause, and Podalydes has the skill to demonstrate that.__The film is a vehement drama and a fitfully amusing snark fest set to Nicola Piovani's jaunty circus music. It winds up only half-succeeding at both.__"The Conquest," a feature about recent French politics, makes me yearn for a similar American treatment of our own scene.__"Conquest'' is a seriocomic portrait of naked ambition and a depiction of petty office politics on a national scale. It's a deadpan hoot that lacks the bite it could and arguably should have had.__Failing to find deeper meaning in their protagonist's crises, they tell the story in a way that will only hold the interest of those who already know it fairly well.__Durringer has a good sense of pacing, and he keeps the various interlocking machinations reasonably comprehensible even for those of us who aren't experts in French political intrigue.__Watching Sarko steamroll his even-more-unctuous rivals has its pleasures, but how can this outrageous creature of raw ambition also be treated in such sobering terms? The Conquest tries to have it both ways.__A lot gets lost in translation in "The Conquest,'' an account of Nicolas Sarkozy's 2007 rise to the French presidency.__A smart, involving and strikingly adult drama about Sarkozy's rise to power...__Only intermittently rises above the tone of an arch, sniping drawing-room comedy peopled with mild caricatures.__The Conquest offers that familiar thrill of being allowed to peek behind the curtain and see what our leaders are really like...__A drama about the dirty business of gaining power, it needs bared fangs-and more bite.__Aided by an excellent ensemble cast, director Xavier Durringer and his co-scripter, Patrick Rotman, don't refrain from showing this truly repellent side of Sarko during his rise from minister of justice in 2002 to the highest elected office.__Pic takes genre helmer Xavier Durringer back to his theater roots, with most of the narrative mayhem and laughs coming from pic's sharp dialogue and strong work by seasoned thesps, who just manage to avoid caricature.__None__None
It's well worth seeing the performance of young Morgana Davies as Simone, a child who becomes convinced that her late father speaks and listens to her through the comforting branches of the tree next to her house.__In the end, The Tree is something of a stretch; but it's a good stretch, a mix of mysticism and family dynamics both satisfying and intriguing.__"The Tree" might have suffered from too much symbolism if not for writer-director Julie Bertuccelli's deft touch and Gainsbourg's appealing performance.__Despite the potential for some supernatural grandiosity, the tone here remains understated and quiet, and Gainsbourg's performance feels lived-in, and deep, and right.__The arboreal metaphor is overworked as the tree's roots choke off the rural home's water supply, but the story has a winning, fable-like directness.__Beautifully filmed in the harsh, dry landscape, "The Tree" is often mesmerizing...__Unusual and endearing.__It's simply vagueness.__It's not exactly subtle. But it works.__Bertuccelli uses the scrubbed topography of Queensland, Australia, to mostly eloquent effect, although her mystical symbols can be as on-the-nose as her dialogue.__What makes The Tree feel like a movie about actual people and not just writer's constructs are the powerful performances by Gainsbourg and young Davies.__This is an easy movie to watch. If only Julie Bertuccelli had more trust in her most interesting stuff.__A movie that's content to stand still.__In the end, the metaphor dominates. At every turn, the fig tree makes a statement.__"The Tree" falls short of being revelatory, yet has a mysterious, sturdy power that grows on you.__"The Tree" is slow-moving, but if given a chance, it will (pardon the pun) grow on you.__The movie is truly a tree-hugger's delight (I confess to being one such hugger) that makes the most of its metaphors without straining toward supernatural schmaltz.__The Tree is well-acted, and Bertuccelli successfully makes some obvious metaphors come off as unforced.__The movie's mundane account of moving on is ultimately more gripping than its wooden metaphors.__In her second film, writer-director Julie Bertuccelli is sometimes partial to clumsy dialogue. But Gainsbourg and Davies, almost feral with her mass of untamed blond curls, make a memorable parent-child pair.
__This histrionic family drama must have looked good on paper to attract such a big-name cast, but on the screen it comes off as glib, rushed, and underdeveloped.__The emotional effectiveness varies from moment to moment between not pushing too hard or simply not pulling hard enough.__A dreadful exercise in navel-gazing that resides in a particularly trite corner of Pat Conroy-ville.__A dispiriting rehash of dysfunctional family cliches that seems to last longer than Thanksgiving Day dinner.__The actors are all good and a few scenes -- an opening family argument, a crucial battle when Michael finally fights back -- are painfully moving.__The relationships are lived-in and complex, with the same hopelessness that we find in real life. People don't change.__Lee doesn't trust his storytelling or the audience.__"Fireflies" is probably too convoluted to pave the way for more roles of this sort, but watching Reynolds get inside Michael's pain, you hope it won't be long until something will.__[A] middling effort about the fights and reconnections experienced by a family gathered due to an unexpected tragedy...__A fraught family drama that shows us the same family in past and present, 22 years apart. It might have been more effective if it had followed a chronological order.__It's a tragedy, in all of the wrong ways.__Despite an A-list roster, the performances are universally one-note, a fact largely attributable to a script overflowing with blunt dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism.__It's not a bad film - Lee directs with subtle grace and the cast is predictably strong - but it's saddled with too many characters, not enough drama and a strong sense of overfamiliarity.__The movie is one long argument, tiresome and repetitive, that produces more heat than light.__Despite the mega-wattage of pic's starry cast, theatrical prospects seem dim for this clumsy melodrama, which looks and sounds no better than an average made-for-cabler.__None__None__None__None
"Puncture" has the unusual problem of being almost too intriguing; its based-on-true-events story seems to cry out for documentary treatment.__"Puncture'' is based on an actual court case. But is this a story best served by focusing on the legal battle or the arc of Mike's flawed hero?__Evans works so hard to look like a drug addict that it undermines the character's effort not to look like one.__It's a thoughtful entry in the growing subgenre of whistle-blower dramas.__Does a commendable job of merging its David vs. Goliath elements with Weiss' personal problems, doing justice to the fact that "Puncture" is based on true people and an actual case.__Electrifying in the role, Evans reminds me of other great out-of-control druggies played by Al Pacino and Nicolas Cage.__This true-life film is a likable oddity: a rambling, low-budget Erin Brockovich with a cokehead hero.__Evans is an electrifying presence, working overtime to save the day.__"Puncture" presents a compelling story, but it's also difficult to sympathize with Evans' doomed main character, no matter how vividly he's acted.__[It] possesses all the right ingredients: an idealistic young lawyer, a corrupt corporate villain and a sympathetic victim. It just fails to assemble them into a compelling whole.__The picture benefits from its performances, notably Evans' roguish appeal as a guy simultaneously driven and destructive.__There's something perverse about the ultra-conventional way directors/brothers Adam and Mark Kassen handle their unconventional material in the based-on-a-true-story drama Puncture.__Like any good cautionary tale, Puncture tells a suspenseful story responsibly, creating food for thought and leaving the audience both enlightened and entertained.__It's Weiss's sheer gonzo energy and his determination to keep it together (barely) in the name of justice that initially fuel this underdog tale...__Puncture is proudly "Based on a True Story." As is so often the case, this means an indifference to "true" human relationships in favor of crusading self-righteousness.__The film is chock-a-block with extraordinary performances and no one will fault the filmmaking either. This is a well-made movie, make no mistake. It just suffers from a dysfunctional hero.__Working from a fact-based script, tyro helmers Adam and Mark Kassen fashion an impassioned expose on the health-care industry full of strange-but-true incongruities in Puncture.__None__None__None
It can seem as if style is all in Dolan's films, but as well as revelling in its pleasures, they also dissect its limitations - sometimes without anaesthetic.__Ultimately what makes "Heartbeats" tick is that it's less about love objects and more about friends who are stuck with each other, for better or worse.__Spends 100 minutes dispensing painful examples of how infatuation turns people into idiots.__There are moments of heartbreaking beauty in it - although Dolan is still a work in progress. He'll get better - he's immensely talented - but he's not quite there yet.__Not too deep but oh so pretty, "Heartbeats" presents a hyper-stylized look at a love triangle, a sort of "Jules and Jim" for millennials.__Alas, although Heartbeats is quite lovely to look at, there isn't much going on after all.__"Heartbeats" charts its own course.__A pretty decent film in its own right, and a remarkably good one if you consider the filmmaker turns 22 this month.__All the dramatic protraction gets at both a heaviness of romantic desire and emotional viscosity.__Dolan is proving to be adept at and unafraid of teasing out the flaws of his characters, seemingly more concerned with whether they are interesting than whether an audience will like them.__It's a bright, slight romp that seems to want to zero in on the pain and trauma of romantic obsession. If the filmmaker weren't having such fun mocking characters who fall hard while pretending not to, it might just be able to achieve that.__The triangulations of their desire are amusing but Dolan, as a director, is all attitude.__"Heartbeats" looks good, and it has some funny dialogue. But there isn't enough to sustain the film's running time.__The new movie confirms Mr. Dolan as a wildly talented, carelessly extravagant filmmaker nakedly in thrall to idols like Wong Kar-wai, Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Bernardo Bertolucci and Pedro Almodovar.__The film couples high comedy with spiritual solitude. That's not just a slo-mo stunt, it's a cockeyed triumph.__It contains all the passion and drama that animated I Killed My Mother, but carried across with greater assurance and technique.__[A] madly stylish Montreal-made delight...__Xavier Dolan is the new darling of Canadian cinema, and it's easy to see why.__Though his results are sometimes raw, Dolan seems to be chronicling heartache as he discovers it.

An ambitious, almost epic drama that devotes as much time to introspection as it does to combat.__"Shaolin" fits in the more somber kung-fu tradition. But it also finds room for the genre's comic strain.__The epic feel to this Hong Kong action-drama helps balance a lack of hand-to-hand combat scenes.__More action, less talk should be the order of the day, but it isn't.__Shaolin features a half-dozen impressive action set pieces, including an elaborate carriage chase and a battle inside the cages where Cao imprisons his workers.__The kung fu itself is great fun to watch, from the discipline of balancing on one foot on a wooden pillar, the other in the air, for hours at a time to the confrontations that send fist and feet flying.__Fists fly furiously and much blood is spilled; there's a sacrifice via sword that's both cringe-inducing and cheerworthy.__This crude, overlong chunk of kung-fu kitsch lays its scene in a 1920s Republican China, torn by internecine fighting and weighed down by drably expensive production design.__A well-mounted but soft-edged reinterpretation of a martial arts classic that gives precedence to drama over action.__Well-mounted Chinese-Hong Kong martial-arts co-production Shaolin elevates enlightenment above brute strength, but weak helming undercuts the pic's punch.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

It's tempting to watch If a Tree Falls doc about a scraggly group of ecoterrorists with a chip of skepticism on your shoulder.

He's just not a very compelling figure.__The gripping documentary If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front offers an intimate look at the radical environmental group.__Unless you are a true believer in the tenets of deep ecology, the film may seem more like an apology for the group's dangerous activities.__An informative, if troubling, narrative about the future of the environmental movement.__Despite their efforts to address most sides of this complex story, each new interview leaves us wanting to know even more.__Considering its incendiary subject, Curry's approach is disarmingly tame; perhaps reframing the debate in less volatile terms is some kind of lukewarm triumph.__This is a sterling example of journalistic documentary, clearer, fairer and more engrossing than any of the sensationalistic newspaper or magazine stories about ELF.__Though it is amusing watching the ring fall apart, "Goodfellas"-style, as the terrorists rat on each other, the film's sense of grievance will be shared by few.__The film's sobriety and carefully balanced arguments make it an exemplary piece of reporting, although its emotional heat rarely rises to a boil.__Takes us through reams of fascinating drama, from the first heroic forest-saving protests to the reactive police violence and resulting dead-of-night firebombs to the core group's implosion after the FBI tightens the net.__A trenchant examination of radical environmentalism and the implications of domestic terrorism laws.__A gimlet-eyed glimpse into the roots of terrorism and the politics behind its prosecution.__None__None__None__None__None

Dirty Girl isn't.

What matters more is the thick sense of atmosphere that Mann and her collaborators conjure.__The plot is a chaos of underdeveloped relationships and frayed loose ends, but every so often, Mann does something so right that it makes this seem less a matter of narrative disorganization than a commentary on the anarchy intrinsic to any investigation.__Despite the presence of some notable names at the top of the cast including the currently ubiquitous Jessica Chastain, the steadily-paced drama looks more of a small-screen proposition.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Sewitsky is a bit too fond of the handheld camera, but she is immediate, close.

Mendelsohn's dialogue is, for the most part, as spare as poetry, and the three stories are woven together masterfully and acquire a gleaming aura that's almost pastoral.__Little is left to chance, and every detail contributes to a tightly schematic, microcosmic poetic concept.__Well-acted and acutely observed, the sort of cerebral fare you can more typically find on HBO than in theaters these days.__My mind kept wandering.__A story in which poor real folks are granted perspective only by brushing up against starlets, accidents, and villains of the tabloid press.__The movie has none of the smugness of American Beauty: You could dream of living in a world like this.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
There's a lot to like here - not least disarmingly natural performances from the mostly non-professional actors.__I remember 15. It was a mess. Mitchell's movie serenely amplifies the mess.__The Myth of the American Sleepover is an indie movie-lover's dream, one of those rare instances where a lack of budget and experience is trumped by heartfelt vision, natural talent and amateur enthusiasm.__With "The Myth of the American Sleepover," first-time writer-director David Robert Mitchell tells a coming-of-age tale with such freshness and such bemused insight it's as if it has never been told before.__A one-of-a-kind teen movie, which captures that distinctive moment in adolescent life when nostalgia, loss and anxiety begin to populate one's consciousness with ghosts.__I can sympathize with the need to connect with teen audiences without having to resort to the usual antics, but the answer is not to swap the real world for a patently fake one.__While there is some sense of the complex dynamics that propel all teen parties, the pacing drags in a way a summer night never should.__David Robert Mitchell's auspicious debut feature owes a lot to "Dazed and Confused" and other coming-of-age flicks, but it's an engaging piece of filmmaking on its own, beautifully shot and acted.__A coming-of-age movie that evokes the teenage experience through minor, incisive observation, then leaves without making anything so conspicuous as a statement.__What Mr. Mitchell gets splendidly right in this quiet, observant film, is the unsteady mixture of sophistication and naivete that is central to the modern American teenage way of being in the world.__Mitchell has an &#8232; ear for the tentativeness of adolescence, the way that everyone is trying on postures, attitudes, selves.__Slightly clumsy but hugely endearing.__Well-intentioned but derivative and only intermittently engaging, the suburban Michigan-set indie hits at least as many false notes as true ones.__A lovely, gentle and very true film set on a long night in a small Michigan city at the end of summer.__Sleepover is less a fully realized artistic expression than an able reworking of a well-worn genre.__The young director, whose day job is editing commercials, has never made a narrative feature-length movie before and shows no aptitude for it here.__Mitchell seems trapped in an unspecified '90s-ish retro zone, and you wonder how good his sleepovers really were.__Mitchell finds a balance that's just right in juggling all these emotions and presenting them believably in screen. His little movie is pretty much perfect in depicting youthful imperfection.__Sloma is always interesting to watch: She's even almost credible when tasked with delivering the film's thesis in the form of a lesson learned.__Funny and frank, real and romantic, Myth feels like a mix of a poem and a party, as brief and beautiful as the right kind of summer night.
We're left to decide which wounds go the deepest, those from Afghanistan or those caused by the confusion and emotional barrages he continues to suffer in America.__In its closing scenes, "Hell and Back Again" builds to an emotional and stylistic power that we didn't see coming.__Dennis's film attempts something few documentaries have: to inhabit the psyche of its subject.__The film suggests that it doesn't really matter whether Harris ever gets back in uniform. He's forever carrying around a piece of unexploded ordnance in his head.__Lays bare the truth of war - its hellish quality - with such power, you're not likely to look at this, or any other conflict, the same way again.__The director has no intention of making a prefab antiwar statement. He simply wants to show us an experience, just as it happened, and let the chips fall where they may.__As vital as the best war chronicles to come out in recent years, this is one every American ought to see.__Dennis, a photojournalist, has produced a verite work of almost distracting beauty-a haunting quality in a film that operates in the apolitical mode of choice for recent combat docs, but is nevertheless inarguably about the cost of war.__The visuals are consistently bleak, but the film's engagement with Harris and the often-harsh world around him is clear-eyed and empathetic.__Dennis refuses to push a political agenda down viewers' throats. But the message of his film -- a breathlessly paced look at the realities of war -- is clear: War and its aftermath are indeed hell.__Working alone with a camera and his ingenuity, Dennis captured the surreality of firefights with an invisible enemy and the frustration of displaced civilians.__You can feel just how jarring and stressful it must be for a soldier to go from the life-and-death adrenaline rush of war to the maddeningly slow world of rehabilitation and forced inactivity.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Basque director Alex de la Iglesia's exotic, surreal, hilarious, bloody and utterly explosive grand opus.__From the far-too-teeming brain of Spanish writer/director Alex de la Iglesia, The Last Circus is a bizarre, surreal, grotesque, fascinating, demanding, disappointing and ultimately exhausting political allegory that plays like a waking nightmare.__For those with a taste for the subversive and outrageous, run, don't walk.__You're left with the vague recollection of an interesting movie you were watching before you got kidnapped and subjected to over an hour of torture porn starring a fat, sadistic clown.__If you like your baroque sex and violence with a side dish of heavy-duty symbolism ... put "The Last Circus" on your must-see list right now.__Take Fellini, Tarantino and "Taxi Driver," throw 'em in a cage with a lion, and you'd get this strange, wild trip.__Although not everybody's glass of sangria, it has the making of a cult hit.__Brilliant, bizarre, dazzling and utterly demented...__Plenty of moments linger...__Baroquely sinister and grotesquely funny.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"Louder Than a Bomb" has a lot in common with such documentaries as "Spellbound" and "Mad Hot Ballroom": charismatic, if obsessed, kids and nail-biting suspense.__Think of it as "Glee'' without music.

____The final scene offers clarity, at least, if not a satisfying payoff.__"The Road to Nowhere" plays like an exercise in frustrating audiences.__Ultimately, the film gets too clever and confusing for its own good, while the slow pacing zaps momentum from the story (and the story within the story).__A rabbit hole of enigmatic characters and swampy motives...Shot by shot, the film has a burnished, beautiful sheen.__"Road to Nowhere" is a beautifully made, glorious mess.__A stylish, shimmering neo-noir with a multi-layered narrative for which the director's longtime collaborator Steven Gaydos has written an exceedingly elliptical and challenging script.__There are rewards to be teased out of Monte Hellman's enigmatic new picture, but you'll have to accept the title as a promise, rather than a threat.__Has a great setup but not much in the way of a payoff.__If Mr. Hellman's movie only partly fulfills its promise as a gripping neo-noir mystery, his stylistic hallmarks lend it a singularly haunting atmosphere.__The tone and subject at times recall David Lynch's Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr., but the approach is Hellman's own.__Hellman's meta-thriller milks a let's-get-lost vibe for all it's worth; you're never sure where the Mobius strip ends and the movie itself begins.__[Combines] an almost quaint self-reflexiveness with state-of-the-art digital filmmaking...__None__None__None__None__None__None
While it's satisfying to see fat cats tamed by science and an enraged public, the movie misses the opportunity to sustain the pressure.__This straightforward documentary by Charles Evans Jr. is must viewing for anyone interested in public health and corporate ethics.__Once it finds its footing in old-fashioned journalism, the film packs a wallop.__"Addiction Incorporated" follows tobacco's journey downhill from respectability.__Rather than relying only on archival footage and a parade of talking heads, Evans mixes it up with reenactments of episodes in the past. It's subtly unobtrusive and effective.__While its thoroughness is laudable, its pacing is deadly. And the events and attitudes depicted already have become curiously passe in less than a decade.__A straightforward, effective mix of talking heads and newsreel footage.__Evans mines enough fresh info from the story that it feels at times familiar but not redundant.__It's engrossing, even if it does lack the element of surprise.__DeNoble is an ideal subject, a riveting, passionate storyteller who witnessed industry shenanigans first-hand a full decade before they were exposed to the public.__Like most documentaries detailing the efforts of corporate whistle-blowers, Charles Evans Jr.'s verite expose venerates its subject's (admittedly worthy) actions to the point where legitimate fascination sours into uncritical appreciation.__Producer Charles Evans Jr.'s directorial debut finds an engrossing suspense angle in the involvement of Victor DeNoble, an idealistic scientist-turned-whistleblower whose suppressed corporate research became the bombshell catalyst in that struggle.__Straight-shooting, hard-hitting and fuming with contempt for the tobacco industry, "Addiction Incorporated" would be almost too exhausting to watch were it not for the folksy charm of its star witness.__With a name that not even the PR team at Smokefree America could dream up, Victor DeNoble emerges as the hero of Charles Evans Jr.'s mostly muscular documentary on the 1990s campaign to expose Big Tobacco.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Tuschi has a sharp sense of tempo and shot composition, and he obviously knows how to ask questions, because he gets good answers.__Helps to make Khodorkovsky more of a reality than the enigma he threatens to become.__"Khodorkovsky" is a curious and admirable documentary, the product of one filmmaker's inability to let go of a story.__Navigating a tangled tale such as this is like entering a hall of mirrors. "Khodorkovsky" doesn't do a good enough job of Windexing them.__It's a perfect fit for the blend of Greek tragedy, spaghetti Western and judicial farce that defines business and politics in the New Russia.__It's unlikely to enflame American audiences with less of a stake in Russia's political goings-on, but works as a persuasive portrait of a politically toxic situation.__The gripping documentary "Khodor-kovsky'' tells how Russia's richest man became its most famous political prisoner.__Tuschi leans too far into an admiring position, and you thirst for some commonsense critique.

Skarsgard, who is perhaps best known for "Good Will Hunting" and "Breaking the Waves," makes the most of his rich role, imbuing Ulrik with a knockabout charm.__A sly delight.__"A Somewhat Gentle Man'' is welcome, in part because Skarsgard is almost the whole show but also because the actor doesn't use the role as an excuse to put on a big performance - to do more. On the contrary, he quite wonderfully does less.__Only an actor of Skarsgard's resources could do so little and make such a big impression.__Like the Coen brothers at their least convincing, the mix of low-grade depression and amped quirkiness never shakes off the feel of self-conscious posturing.__Every stunted, turnip-faced character is dressed for maximum drabness, and the only time the sky isn't drily gray is when it's wet with rain or snow. But Skarsgard's utter finesse in the role provides a satisfying warmth.__A slim story that becomes schmaltzy at the end.__Patiently directed by Hans Petter Moland, Ulrik's journey back to life slowly draws you in.__One of the funniest movies I've seen in years. If you suspect that says more about me than about the film, you might be right.__The gray Norwegian milieu is memorable, and Skarsgard brings some redemptive soul to the role of a man who gradually begins to understand the aptness of his favorite Pretenders album: Learning To Crawl.__The grungy setting and unflattering photography are only camouflage for callow, creeping sentimentality.__An oddball comedy with criminal undertones.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
[An] arty exploitation pic passed off as a feminist parable...__A fascinating, erotically charged mystery.__Leigh, impressively for a first-time filmmaker, has a distinct and confident approach.__Eros snores.__It's a story told in quiet rooms and hushed voices - except for one devastating scream near the end - and it's ultimately a horror story, though one completely free of blood and gore.__Though Julia Leigh's surprisingly dull debut is meant to present the mysteries of a troubled young woman, you're more likely to wonder why its star, Emily Browning, is drawn to such demeaning roles.__Browning is tiny and frighteningly exposed in these scenes, but Leigh turns the tables: In the moment of her greatest vulnerability, Lucy exercises a curious power over the Johns who pay for her time.__The result can feel untouchable and impenetrable, but it also serves to make its visceral moments that much more affecting. This Sleeping Beauty is no fairy tale; it's stark, dispassionate and noticeably short on happily ever afters.__I'm not, finally, sure what Leigh is saying - but she is a filmmaker with a voice.__There is a measure of soft-core titillation in this, for sure, but Ms. Leigh observes Lucy's body and what happens to it with a dreamy detachment that is seductive and unnerving in equal measure.__There's an allegorical quality to what Leigh's up to here.__Precisely staged but maddeningly obtuse, "Sleeping Beauty" is an artful exercise in pointlessness.__It's not much fun watching an Australian director whose small goal in life is to ape French provocateur Catherine Breillat. There's not much thrill in watching Ms. Browning, who is so anesthetized she seems to be dreaming whether she's asleep or awake.__The very beautiful and brave young actor Emily Browning slugs us with another sucker punch in the disturbing debut feature from Australian novelist Julia Leigh.__Sharp and precise as its tableaux might be ... Sleeping Beauty never burrows into the brain, and its tenuous provocations fizzle out quickly.__Truth is, there's really nothing, shameful or otherwise, to see in this pretentious and empty fairy tale.__To be at once earthy and ethereal is an uncommon gift. I noticed it, in Browning...__Sleeping Beauty is one of those self-consciously artsy motion picture that promises more than it delivers.__Browning...proves that she's a fearless and distinctive young actress whose rigorously passive performance imbues her character with immense depth and mystery.__I found it gorgeous, opaque and disturbing in roughly equal portions, but it was a riveting experience all the way through.
It is generally pungent and enlightening.__In this heady documentary, TV footage of left-wing social critic Paul Goodman being interviewed by conservative host William F.

Just when America's trade balance needs all the help it can get from Hollywood's global entertainment dominance comes the latest challenge to its supremacy: a China that can make chick flicks.__Silly and slapsticky, "Love in Space" is too busy devising absurd set pieces to develop the characters or make their mutual attractions plausible.__We're used to seeing Chinese costume dramas with Gong Li and action thrillers in which warlords do battle on horseback.

Mickle's observation of a devastated working-class America is so sharp that the horror elements, though effectively handled, come to feel like an afterthought.__Other undead movies needlessly foreground the action. "Stake Land'' has its fight scenes, but here they're secondary.__Jeff Grace's melancholy music underscores the atmosphere of bleak dystopian despair, leavened by flashes of humour and hope.__Shows that a savvy mixture of characterization, atmosphere and gore-eographed suspense can make even the most familiar fright tropes feel vaguely organic again.__"Stake Land" bursts with action, ideas and interesting characters.__Mickle has talent, and the end credits include a character known as "French Canadian Cannibal," which is worth a half-star right there.__Director Jim Mickle, who co-wrote the film with his star Nick Damici, has crafted a good-looking, well-played and atmospheric apocalyptic vision.__Though it has plenty of shocks, the film creates a wasteland that would be compellingly deranged even without vampires pressing insistently at every border. Horror is just the half of it.__Some numbers are too large to contemplate. How many drops of water are there in the ocean? How many grains of sand are there in the desert? How many more apocalyptic zombie movies must I sit through?__Ryan Samul's cinematography and Jeff Grace's score pick up the slack, smoothly maintaining an unstable atmosphere of lurking horror.__The whole movie aches from tired blood.__There isn't much dialogue, and most of the 98-minute running time is devoted to locking in one terrifyingly gothic encounter after another, but the characters are well defined, and director Mickle makes every dime of his micro-budget count.__It's an ambitious hybrid, grafting the ethereal, landscape-driven, light-infused beauty and naif narration associated with Terrence Malick onto a tale in which struggle against supernatural forces is just one challenge of coming of age.__A gritty, low-key hybrid of horror film and road movie that aptly demonstrates the stylistic flexibility of this undying genre.__Fans of Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" will find much to enjoy in this sombre and nerve-wracking postapocalyptic horror film, directed and co-written by Jim Mickle.__A highly satisfying low-budget horror-thriller.__None__None__None__None

Suleiman takes the approach of gentle observer, neither condoning nor confronting -- not violently, at least.

Not Suleiman. He knows the power of well-conceived humor.__Both a musical construction and a work more concerned with form, light, sound and music than with what its characters say or do.__A thorny and intricate film that is also breathtakingly simple and honest.__Suleiman's a more assured director than he is a comedian.

Every kitchen-sink dramatic cliche is trotted out in John Gray's Brooklyn period piece.__A movie that one watches with the sense of pushing it up a hill.__Despite the cliches that push every scene forward, there's an unexpected appeal to John Gray's modest drama, emanating from its center.__The basic outline of the plot, built around a promised local concert by the Rolling Stones - well, if you don't know where that story is headed, you haven't seen as many movies as I think you have.__Writer-director John Gray digs into his own background to create the ardent and atmospheric White Irish Drinkers. The close, cramped intimacy of this film is so real it stings.__White Irish Drinkers is a heavy borrower deep into the pocket of pop culture's loan shark, and lacking the grace to acknowledge the debt.__Saturated with atmosphere and strongly acted, the movie is a far more resonant and convincing portrait of working-class life than the recent awards-bait phoniness that called itself "The Fighter."__Frequently enough at the movies, an isolated scene can take place in which an actor who may or may not be the lead steals the whole film through naked emotion, or power, or eloquence. Mr. Lang certainly has one here.__The cliches are what make "White Irish Drinkers" a drearily predictable bout...__Putting profane adjectives in front of every other noun in dialogue that wants desperately to sound streetwise doesn't make it feel authentic if the other words spoken by the characters are arranged into orderly little blocks of exposition.__It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment when the mediocre White Irish Drinkers goes off the rails. Maybe the problem is the predictable story just never leaves the station.__All the good intentions in the world can't save "White Irish Drinkers'' from playing like the baldest of retreads.__I was immensely impressed with Mr. Thurston, an appealing actor with intelligence and self-assurance who is going places, and writer-director John Gray, who has already arrived with a bang.__John Gray's Noo Yawker indie is a stubborn throwback to the Sundance-fueled, ethnic-neighborhood movie of the early '90s, when every film-school grad with a fresh head full of Mean Streets decided he would be the next Scorsese.__A modestly engaging domestic drama that earns few points for originality but rewards aud attention with persuasive performances, outbursts of robust humor and a vivid yet understated evocation of time and place.__It's a sparkling piece of entertainment that deserves a wide audience.__None__None__None__None
__Muddled cop thriller The Son of No One has a top-drawer cast and a bottom-drawer script.__Life is a struggle, the new film "The Son of No One" makes that explicitly clear. But so is moviemaking, and unfortunately the toil is all too evident in writer-director Dito Montiel's messy, logic-strained third feature.__It just feels like a mess.__A laughable police melodrama.__"The Son of No One" self-destructs in a ludicrous, ineptly directed anticlimactic rooftop showdown in which bodies pile up, and nothing makes a shred of sense.__Something is lacking in the dramatic equation.__This heavy-handed muddle of a cop thriller is just impossibly bad.__There's a real flavor to the subway-platform offices, cramped projects and rooftop sanctuaries captured here. Montiel does a fine job of protecting, and serving, this specific city hood.__A few individual performances survive-Liotta finds a little of his old edge, and Pacino briefly revisits Serpico territory-but they're smothered in the slow-burning absurdity.__Here's a bad movie with hardly a bad scene. How can that be? The construction doesn't flow. The story doesn't engage.__The more that secret comes out, the more incoherent (and ludicrous) the film gets.__You can see why actors want to work with Montiel, but actors are notoriously bad judges of whether good scenes will ever add up to a worthwhile movie, which is exactly the problem here.__The Son of No One is so heavy and depressing it just becomes a slog.__Montiel cares little about plot logic or even the remotest connection with reality... but, as in the director's previous work, some terrific acting emerges from the absurd script.__Tatum mainly sits around looking like a pitiable bump on a log while Ray Liotta, as a corrupt superior, makes his patented Intensaface.__Performances are strong across the board, and the movie offers a solid sense of place. But the mysteries, once explained, don't make a lot of sense.__None__None__None
It's easy to feel sucked into some kind of time warp back to the heyday of late-'90s post-Tarantino crime thrillers, cut-rate knockoffs filled with casually cartoonish violence, quippy patter, overtly flash filmmaking and incongruous pop tunes.__If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with genre baloney -- and enough shoplifted visual trickery to fill Quentin Tarantino's kitchen sink.__Though John Stockwell's action comedy is shamelessly derivative, his enthusiastic cast propels it much further than it should go.__An incoherent hybrid of buddy movie, "Girls Gone Wild" episode and James Bond spoof that employs cheap cinematic tricks like multiple split screens for no apparent purpose.__Words like "smug," "derivative," and "shallow" could all be fairly applied to the film, but as a piece of late-night exploitation, it delivers the violence and nudity with the regularity of an IV drip, and some familiar faces in the cast help class it up.__A brazenly efficient and articulate female assassin nearly worthy of a Tarantino or Coen Brothers movie sticks out from amidst the schlocky criminal muck of Cat Run, a self-consciously sleazy comic crime saga composed of facetious elements.__A third-generation Tarantino rip-off distinguished only by its equal-opportunity nudity.__Director John Stockwell uses split screens, a blaxploitation soundtrack, and hammy, Get Smart sound effects to put some old-school spring in Cat Run's step.

"Cracks" is a moody, often lurid tale of rivalry and repression.__Although Green is the sort of actress you can't take your eyes off , her presence is not enough to keep this movie from becoming mired in a slow and predictable rut.__"Cracks" is a bit of a knock-off, but it's a sturdily assembled vessel for a promising director and cast.__While Scott's movie has a consistent aura, it lacks a consistent tone.__Driven more by characters and relationships than narrative, Cracks explores the exclusionary power of cliques that develop within a closed society, the single-minded violence of the mob mentality, and the seductive charm of the charismatic individual.__"Cracks" recalls any number of girls-school dramas, like the much better "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" (1969).__In many ways "Cracks" is lurid and rickety. But its gripping ensemble performances lend it an emotional intensity that outweighs its shortcomings.__Worth seeing just to watch Ms. Green ride that teacher right off the rails.__The pieces never form a convincing, or coherent, whole.__For much of Cracks' first two-thirds, Scott and company avoid the obvious melodramatic beats and just let the story unfold, even as the narrative shifts its attention from character to character.__There is so little dialogue of any significance that I can't figure out why the film is credited with three screenwriters, but Ms. Scott knows what to do with the camera to show dark psychological forces at work...__All of which is heavy-breathing fun until an ill-judged lapse into Lord of the Flies territory and a Jean Rhys-ian climax all but bury the message about the evils of repression.__Scott has fashioned a film as ponderous as it is obvious, weighed down by a string-heavy soundtrack and achingly slow editing.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

With a cheeky attitude and a live-and-let-live message, the Topps are irresistible ambassadors for New Zealand, where a daft sense of humor appears to be a key natural resource.__A fond, uncomplicated love letter to two irrepressible good-time Charlottes.__Sometimes corny, often funny and just as often touching, their act has been wowing Kiwis for decades.__One secret to the Topps' widespread acceptance is in plain sight: their remarkably old-fashioned act.__They've been performing for 30 years and it's safe to say that if they had any appeal here, you would have heard of them by now.__Merging old-fashioned comedy routines with up-to-the-minute politics - all of it enabled by fun-loving personalities and a gift for rousing original songs - the ladies emit a genuine warmth that reels audiences in.__Pooley successfully conveys that joie de vivre, erring only when including too-invasive scenes of Jools's breast-cancer treatments.__Definitely a formulaic bit of portraiture, but given its engaging, pioneering subjects, gimmickry is hardly needed to spice things up.__It's a great act that makes for a spry, likeable movie.__The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls is the greatest movie ever made about a lesbian twin sister country singing, yodeling comedy act.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Edmon Roch spins a zippy yarn of Pujol's improbable exploits from archival footage, talking heads, and clips from classic espionage dramas.__An engrossing documentary that is itself largely a work of the director's imagination.__Director Edmon Roch makes some smart conceptual choices that honor his subject's self-invention and mystery.__Fascinating though it is, the movie is thin on historical materials.__Doc's incredible tale of WWII espionage would likely work better as a feature film.__Edmon Roch has a great story to tell in "Garbo the Spy," and he recounts it with the flair of a Hollywood spy movie: "Garbo" is dramatic, entertaining, even funny in parts.__Pulling Garbo's story from Roch's film requires considerable effort. The director takes a cinema verite approach to historical material, which never works, and forgoes narration.__Garbo: The Spy can only suggest who Garcia really was, and why he took it upon himself to fell a tyrant. But even without the fine psychological shading, Garcia's story is a doozy.__The jarring juxtapositions only heighten the enigmatic air of the film's subject; even when he's right in front of us, he seems to be plotting his next wily act.__Some of this footage feels like filler, but Roch's concept is strong: He's creating a dialogue between the fictions Pujol created to help win the war and the fictions Hollywood created to memorialize that victory.__How does one make a documentary about a cipher? In "Garbo the Spy," Roch solves that problem, and magnificently so.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
____It's a blunderbuss satire that criminally wastes a talented cast.__In truckin' past so many fruitful oases, "Salvation Boulevard" is a bumpy road.__[An] enjoyable if simplistic black comedy loosely based on a novel by Larry Beinhart.__It's quite funny at times and has some good performances. But it's so predictable it has no bite, either as social satire or as slapstick comedy.__Salvation Boulevard has a terrific cast and not much else.__Starts out on the right path, but loses its way early on.__A reasonably funny religious satire that takes potshots at easy targets but is quite watchable due to the participation of two Oscar winners and two Oscar nominees.__Without the humor, the stereotypes that define these characters aren't satirical; they're just mean-spirited and dull.__There is the inkling of a strong, interesting idea here ... but "Salvation Boulevard" is itself too loosely tethered to the actual world to make the point with the necessary vigor or acuity.__The movie transforms a dim idea -- "Elmer Gantry" lite -- into comedy that's dead in the water and as dull as it is broad.__A misfire of the first order, starting with the way writer-director Ratliff and co-writer Doug Max Stone turn what could've been a provocative, gripping story into an over-the-top yukfest.__Despite the talents of Greg Kinnear, Pierce Brosnan, Marisa Tomei, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Ciaran Hinds, Yul Vazquez and Jim Gaffigan, "Salvation Boulevard" is far less than the sum of its fine, character-actor parts.__It's a stupid farrago of aborted ideas, misguided actors, lame direction, submental writing and follow-the-dots plotting that never comes anywhere within a 10-mile radius of what I used to call coherent filmmaking.__Only Tomei, as an ineffectual campus security guard and fellow Deadhead, makes a lasting impression.__Salvation Boulevard isn't groundbreaking or even consistently funny, but it is mildly inventive and the absurdities of its characters are tender and recognizably human. Best of all, we're encouraged to laugh with them rather than at them.__Silly cat-and-mouse comedy doesn't make much of its evangelist-mocking premise.__Careless and bedraggled in its storytelling and never aiming its sights beyond the most obvious targets.__None
"Tuesday, After Christmas" goes down pretty smooth, with a sneaky-powerful aftertaste.__The latest bloom from the flourishing garden that is Romanian cinema, Radu Muntean's Tuesday, After Christmas chronicles the emotional fallout from a classic love triangle, but it unfolds with the agonizing tension of a suspense film.__Like an alternate-universe Woody Allen film, in which real people wrestle with what their hearts want despite the hurt it causes everyone, including themselves.__More about well-observed moments of everyday life than it is about heightened melodrama.__Muntean has pulled off the near-impossible, turning each scene (captured in capacious long takes) into arias of generosity for his actors.__Marital infidelity is hardly a new cinematic topic.

Alas, "The Last Ride" doesn't deliver much insight into Williams or the lifestyle that killed him.__The Last Ride doesn't give us a complete picture of Hank Williams.

"Waiting for Forever" evidently is an attempt to portray love as purest when expressed by those who are most innocent, untainted by the ugliness of the real world.

Happy Valentine's Day!__More often than not, I felt suffocated by the gaseous sentimentality and lightheadedness of a story that drops in subplots that it can't begin to develop.__Director James Keach's movie is so annoyingly dipsy-doodle that TV veteran Bilson, trying hard to look haunted and angsty, is boxed in.__Waiting for Forever isn't just bad; it's fascinatingly bad.__By the time Emma realizes that something might be wrong with her playful, pajama-clad paramour, there are so many red flags she might as well be at a communist rally.__[Waiting for Forever is] strangely unaware of its overt creepiness.__An ill-conceived romantic drama that's as sappy, vague and awkward as its title.__A movie that eludes the viewer's grasp, because it's arguing a position auds will find instinctively wrong.__An indistinct romantic-dramedy-ish something or other.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Prediction: Vanishing on 7th St. will vanish from theaters very quickly.__Brad Anderson's supernatural thriller is stacked to keep us guessing. Initially, this makes it watchably atmospheric.

What audacity! What vision! And, alas, what a failure.__Anderson does a lot with very little - a wavering light, a patch of darkness - and Jaswinski's script tries to break up the stage-bound monotony with a few well-timed (if not particularly informative) flashbacks.__Brad Anderson's creepily effective low-budget thriller may not have a punch line worthy of your typical "Twilight Zone" episode, but it otherwise gets the job done in under an hour and a half with a good cast.__The complete lack of explanation suggests Jaswinski forgot to finish his script. But Anderson tries hard to compensate, distracting us with suitably ghostly atmospherics.__Working from a script with diminishing returns by Anthony Jaswinski, Mr. Anderson smartly frontloads the movie, drawing you in with long shots of deserted cityscapes, the quiet punctured by periodic bird calls and dog barks.__A little more polish in the writing could have made it a must-see, but as it stands, it's a fairly solid B-movie matinee with a nicely calibrated mix of intellectual dread and visceral shock.__After a promising start with a nearly wordless opening 15 minutes, Vanishing becomes awfully talky, with far more time spent on the characters' bickering than on them racing to escape the encroaching darkness.__Mostly, we're left staring blankly at a quartet of victimized ciphers.__Mr. Anderson has evidently watched a lot of old Twilight Zone reruns.

But its wrenching performances make the beating worth weathering.__Propelled by male rage but softened by Considine's big-hearted understanding of his characters, this bruising slice of urban life rewards our patience.__The characters are trapped, suffocated, pushed through a story that gives them very little room or time to figure themselves out, and that finally turns their feelings into the wan stuff of fable.__Considine's intense film isn't easy viewing, and surely isn't pretty, but his actors are remarkable.__Tyrannosaur sounds like a particularly extreme work of British working-class miserablism, but Considine and his cast have no use for comfortable distance created by cliche.__Tyrannosaur is British miserabilism at its most numbingly brutal and blunt.__Hope? Redemption? Catharsis?

Numerous celluloid experiments have fudged reality and fiction lately, but few are as formally inventive or socially revelatory as The Arbor.__For the morbidly curious, it's mesmerizing. But it's also a singularly watchable story for the strange, and strangely fitting, way in which it's told.__[An] exquisitely crafted docudrama.__Barnard's boldest move is to unveil the irresponsible chaos of the playwright's private life, and to make us wonder if the art was worth the suffering, after all.__Brings the Dunbar story to life through a technique known as "verbatim theater," in which actors lip-synch testimony from the real people they're portraying.__Tough, worthy stuff.__Like a Ken Loach drama stripped to bare bones, "The Arbor" springs to life in the bright bitterness of Dunbar's prose, showcased in alfresco performances of contentious scenes from the play.__A bold experiment that doesn't quite work.__Barnard revisits the foredoomed career and tragic afterlife of this slum-born self-educated writer to electrifying effect, shooting mainly on location in Bradford, with actors lip-synched to actual recordings of the people they portray.__The Arbor is a factual documentary that uses fictional techniques to retell a sad truth: The cycle of poverty and violence and addiction is vicious and near impossible to escape.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The conceit is a decent idea for a thriller, if not a terribly original one, but Shapiro loses the rhythm with a plodding story and a pat ending we can see coming a mile away.__Monogamy is a tough little movie. And a good one.__There are certain filmmakers who should have their Cassavetes card revoked, and on the evidence of "Monogamy,'' Dana Adam Shapiro has joined their ranks.__Shapiro puts his own stamp on voyeur cinema.__Despite the ominous feel, this is a mystery about losing or gaining lives and unknown detours.__With modest resources, some nice digital camerawork and an appealing cast -- the likable Ms. Jones draws you in easily -- Mr. Shapiro keeps you engaged even when his story falters.__I reached the outer limits of my endurance level after 25 minutes, but you may make it to an hour.__[An] irksome dither of an indie drama...__The film's final plot twist is easy to spot well before it arrives, but that doesn't detract from its crafty, heartfelt, and surprisingly sound affirmation of getting hitched.__A painfully dull plunge into the suffocating self-absorption that seems to be killing modern romance: Ask not what your relationship can do for you, but what you can do for your relationship, kiddos!__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Pieces together an irresistible puzzle.__Fascinating, accomplished and surprisingly emotional.__Filmmaker Jon Foy sets it to a thriller's pace, even contributing his own fateful score.__This doc is interesting not because of the explanation, but because of the investigation.__Riveting, innovative and provocative are just three of the adjectives that never occurred to me while watching the documentary "Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles."__Without a satisfying resolution, the movie ultimately sheds very little light on its own subject.__Though their quarry eventually appears to be a model of paranoia and prejudice, it's the thrill of the hunt that keeps "Resurrect Dead" compelling.__It's a ride worth more for its journey than its destination.__An Errol Morris-lite essay that's a mildly diverting curio at best.__Resurrect Dead works splendidly as a threadbare urban mystery, teasing out details and complications without withholding too much information.__Entertaining as a sleuthing expedition though amateurish as filmmaking.__Doc about an urban art enigma strains to maintain suspense.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
__The gathering implausibility is dispelled by a nice ending twist.__Ingeniously constructed and propulsively paced.__Leanly scripted, directed for maximum tension, fast-moving and filled with a surprising amount of droll humor.__"Brotherhood" isn't badly acted or without some skillfully tense moments, but it doesn't have much in the way of entertainment value either.__Viewers get paddled into submission in this strident frat-house thriller.__Despite a running time of less than 70 minutes (minus the credits), still outstays its welcome.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"When We Leave" has a predetermined arc that almost chokes its life, but for frustrated witnesses to this passion play, Kekilli offers redemption.__A powerhouse melodrama that feels didactic and manipulative even as it rips your heart out.__The whole sad enterprise is watchable because of Kekilli.__Unfortunately, Aladag was not as nuanced in her approach as her star.__There are some intense, moving sequences, but too much emotional badgering and a general shortage of finesse.__Aside from its conclusion, "When We Leave'' is credible and well-observed.__There are times when the tension lags badly and the story loses its way as Umay spins between her worlds. Still, it's a worthy start, and Aladag's distinctive voice helps the film survive any dismay.__Kekilli delivers a perfectly tuned performance. Too bad the script is often clunky and melodramatic, as the first-time director, Vienna-born Feo Aladag, tries to manipulate viewers' emotions.__It is frequently gripping and sincere in its intentions, but never quite as revelatory, or as devastating, as it should be.__Aladag isn't a particularly expressive filmmaker, and she hits a few bum notes toward the end that feel more like movie payoffs than real-life drama, but she tackles this story with surprising nuance and depth.__Aladag's point, I think, is that no matter how righteous we may feel about this kind of zero-sum cultural collision, for the human beings involved it often results in unbearable tragedy.__Kekilli, more than an unofficial spokeswoman for rebellious Euro-Muslim youth, sells a simple and deterministic story through her sheer presence and precise reaction shots.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A film with some engaging performances and a swell soundtrack whose biggest problem is that it wants to be "Dazed and Confused" when it grows up.__Like so many other films set in the Reagan era, Anthony Burns' directorial debut fails to acknowledge the lingering and pervasive angst that shaped anyone growing up in the late Cold War.__Indifferently acted, written and directed, the oft soporific "Skateland" is beautifully photographed and boasts a greatest-hits soundtrack, as well as some spot-on art direction.__Though noticeably lacking in originality, Anthony Burns' low-key directorial debut skates by on the charms of its hazy wistfulness and a likable cast.__Anthony Burns's sweetly nostalgic re-creation of small-town Texas in the early 1980s.__Manages to offer a particularly affecting, well-observed portrait of young people coming of age in an east Texas town in the 1980s.__Anthony Burns' directorial debut is all trappings, with very little there there, giving the mind plenty of time to wander through compare-and-contrast games. Skateland is more soundtrack than substance.__Skateland is every coming-of-age-after-high-school movie you've ever seen with a formulaic plot and well-worn characters.__The film hinges on too many conventional crises (a car accident, a divorce), but the fact that Burns is better at atmosphere than story isn't all bad.__Fernandez looks like a young Joaquin Phoenix, and everything else here is off-brand familiar.__Dedicating a movie to John Hughes doesn't equal capturing the master's ear for the universality of adolescent angst.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Nothing in this film comes as a surprise, but Bonello's intent to show the place backstage as well as onstage is fulfilled and pertinent, even though the period setting gives the picture a curio air.__It's about forcing us to think about people we never would otherwise and seeing their struggles and humanity.__What gives the film its haunting pull, as well as its feminist undercurrent, is the filmmaker's palpable compassion for these women.__No one, male or female, has any fun, but the men behave as if they do. They are all half-stupefied by the languor in which they drown.__It emphasizes setting over character and plot; and it casts a mood that's both eerie and entrancing.__Seductive on the surface, steely underneath, this is an angry, fascinating, highly political film all wrapped up in costumed frilliness.__"Pleasures" becomes as enveloping - and sometimes as awkward - as one of the L'Apollonide ladies' heaving corsets.__The heavy candlelit chiaroscuro paints the women as mobile Renoirs, Degases and Manets.__It's a gorgeously filmed portrait of a bygone era, with painstaking attention to period detail.__Among other things, a sharp corrective to such effervescent red-light classics as Max Ophuls's "Le Plaisir."__Erratic, occasionally WTF hilarious...__Glamorously louche.__Without soft-pedaling it-the story of "The Girl Who Laughs" alone will brush away that line of criticism-Bonello nonetheless mourns the extinction of the brothel, where the women at least had each other.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash.__If you are a Marvel fan, then The Avengers will feel like Christmas. Thanks to the merry doings of the director, Joss Whedon, all your favorite characters are here, as shiny and as tempting as presents under the tree.__Ultimately, it all comes back to Whedon: His clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled; his unexpected knack for action choreography; his funny, tender, immaculately constructed script.__A spectacle in the grandest sense of the word ...__Whedon, a pop-genre magician best known for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a master of viewer manipulation - because he never gives up his own seat in the crowd.__The performances are so well-pitched in The Avengers, meshing with such vividness and ease, that it's tempting to overpraise the good but not great movie that surrounds them.__The film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom.__It's two-plus hours of visual brawn, unexpected heartbeats and welcome humor.__Its primary purpose is not to explore or subvert the superhero movie, but to lay the groundwork for more of them.__A slow start, a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-"Transformers" to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax.__The banter has zip, the effects are fun, the climactic battle is decently spectacular, and if the 3-D is mostly expendable, there are a few scenes where it adds a nice kick.__Whedon knows how to be self-aware without getting overly cute about it. He has fun highlighting each character's neurosis and knows which personalities clash to greatest effect.__Every now and then, director Joss Whedon executes a quirky camera set-up to assert that the film was created by him and not a team of marketing executives.__This film is stylish, intelligent and, one hopes, influential on the next generation of superhero movies; it should leave a lasting legacy.__Biff! Bam! Boring!__Audiences have been eagerly anticipating this first all-hero extravaganza for years. The wait was worth it.__The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.__A slickly packaged, effects-driven smashup.__There's great entertainment in "The Avengers" - big bold, action-filled silliness with just enough human spirit to sell itself. This is a comic book movie done right.__It's a first-class production all around, from the acting to the 3-D special effects to the touches of wit throughout. It delivers, in grand style, the thing we demand most from a comic-book movie: fun.
[This] wrap-up wraps up few of the threads in the first two films, and that the climactic cliff-hangers are nothing special (as well as flabbily edited).__The story is dense, overlong, and studded with references that will make sense only to those intimate with Nolan's previous excursions into Batmanhood.__There was an opportunity here for Nolan to show us another way, to (again) stretch the boundaries of what is possible in a superhero film. Instead, alas, the latter half of The Dark Knight Rises retreats toward conventionality.__I'm not arguing that Rises should be Singin' in the Rain. But its Wagnerian ambitions are not matched by its material. It hasn't earned its darkness.__The biggest surprise may just be how satisfying Nolan has made his farewell to a Dark Knight trilogy that many fans will wish he'd extend to a 10-part series, at least.__Others will see it differently, but for me this is a disappointingly clunky and bombastic conclusion to a superior series -- Nolan's biggest and worst movie to date.__The director and cowriter/brother Jonathan Nolan pay heed to Wayne's wounded emotional arc. And the film is a feat of painstakingly crafted closure.__TDKR completes on the great trilogies in movie history.__Yes, The Dark Knight Rises. And rises. And rises some more.__Nolan knows where the good stuff will be mined: big IMAX action scenes juxtaposed with intimate moments of dialogue.__Spoiler alert: "The Dark Knight Rises" will earn a billion dollars, be the subject of more master's theses than "Citizen Kane" and win the Academy Award for best picture.__This could - should - have been a swifter movie, but it sends the Batguy out in style. And let's face it, he's earned it.__At over two hours and forty minutes long, with repeated scenes of bone-crunching violence and a maddeningly unrelenting percussive score by Hans Zimmer, The Dark Knight Rises is something of an ordeal to sit through.__Arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen.__Production-wise, effects-wise, Nolan's movie - much of its big action sequences shot with Imax cameras - is spectacular.__A fitting conclusion to an artful trilogy, culminating with satisfying dazzle, despite some notable flaws.__Nolan's finale gives us the inevitable with generous portions of suspense, surprise and delicious shock.__Moments are stretched. Every recollection must be illustrated by a flashback. Character motivations shift on a dime, and if you understand even half of what's going on -- not generally, but specifically -- you'll be doing better than most.__A satisfying and often breathtaking tale of good and evil.__At a time when Hollywood seems incapable of doing anything that isn't a grand-scale fantasy, Nolan has hijacked the form to bring it down to earth.
The film shows precious little hunger and no sense of game.__Even when two people are just talking calmly, Ross jerks the camera around. Why? As the sense of danger increases, he has nothing to build toward.__Ross manages to keep the pacing remarkably swift, given that the games themselves don't start until halfway through the 144-minute running time.__Like the select participants of its savage sport, The Hunger Games stands triumphant, if scarred and a bit wobbly from the contest.__It features a functioning creative imagination and lots of honest-to-goodness acting by its star, Jennifer Lawrence, who brings her usual toughness and emotional transparency to the archer-heroine Katniss.__Watching The Hunger Games, I was struck both by how slickly Ross hit his marks and how many opportunities he was missing to take the film to the next level -- to make it more shocking, lyrical, crazy, daring.__The Hunger Games' pacing is brisk, its stakes as high as stakes get, and its leading lady engaging enough that the odds - at the box office at least - will be ever in its favor.__The movie is undeniably a rich fantasy adventure, with plenty of narrative wiggle-room for the two books/movies to follow.__Measured against its downright subversive subtext, you have to come away impressed by the level of achievement.__The first book of Suzanne Collins's prodigiously popular trilogy has been brought to the screen with a Jumbotron sensibility, a shaky camera to emphasize the action and a shakier grip on the subject's emotional core.__Well-paced, well-directed and extremely well acted entertainment.__Director Gary Ross' adaptation, co-scripted by Collins herself, isn't quite as crackingly paced as the novel, but it will more than satisfy existing fans of the trilogy and likely create many new ones.__Viewers who like a side order of political allegory with their science fiction will find much to savor here. So will romantics, fans of feminist heroines and action enthusiasts. "The Hunger Games" is that rare creation, an event movie of real significance.__Director Gary Ross generally avoids the elaborate exterior shots and special effects that dominate high-concept blockbusters.__It's a streamlined fable with enough zing to keep the franchise flying until the next round.__Again and again Katniss rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim, a combination that makes her insistently watchable, despite Mr. Ross's soft touch and Ms. Lawrence's bland performance.__Ross moves between action and human drama with nimble awareness of the weight of the issues coursing through the story of fascism, propaganda, and, yes, adolescence under the weight of the world.__[It] smells very much like a movie with money on its mind - not altogether successfully balancing its loftier ideas with a sense of superficial whimsy and Vegas-meets-Wizard of Oz production design.__It carefully walks a difficult line: How do you tell an essentially violent story without glorifying that violence?__Efficient if not electric, "The Hunger Games" is still epic in intent.
It's been a long time since I enjoyed a Bond movie so much.__'Quantum of Solace,' was a dour, dire letdown. This picture's a substantial bounce back, and easily the best Craig Bond picture. Emotional depth and all.__The cool accomplishment of Skyfall, 23rd in the Broccoli franchise, is that it seems a necessary, rather than mandatory, addition to the year's popular culture.__Among the most ambitious imaginings of Bond to date: dark, supple, and punctuated with moments of unanticipated visual brilliance.__Mendes' approach to action is classical and elegant - no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here - but what makes the movie special is the attention he pays his actors.__"Skyfall" is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One "Skyfall" is enough.__Great heroes are often enhanced by the villains they face, and such is the situation here. To really work, Bond needs great bad guys. Silva is bad at its best.__Skyfall leaves you wondering whether this incarnation of the character has anywhere left to go. It's the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his.__The movie's smartest suit is emotional intelligence: Skyfall keeps us caring, intensely, for a hero who, by any rational measure, is a vestige of a vanished era.__This is the movie in which the newest Bond finally eases into the part of the bon vivant for-Queen-and-Country horndog who likes his martinis shaken and not stirred.__The director, Sam Mendes, has taken a pop concept and solemnized it with Freud, which is not, perhaps, the best way of turning Bond into grownup entertainment.__Craig has settled into a well-suited, grim-reaper role. Even when James flirts and trysts, his creased face suggests an unmovable weight.__Daniel Craig, in his third outing as 007, has taken over the role in a way that makes it his as distinctively as it was Sean Connery's all those years ago.__What a difference 50 years makes. It might sound blasphemous, but in Skyfall Daniel Craig has it all over previous 007s.__There's a gritty, real-world feel to Skyfall that makes good use of Craig's down-to-earthiness.__This is a smashing entertainment, but also one that feels over-engineered and constrained by its origins.__While "Skyfall" obviously has a great fondness for the past, it's not trapped there. It also anticipates Bond's future. In this immensely satisfying movie, so do we.__Skyfall is certainly the most cultured Bond film to come along in some time. It's also the first of the three Craig endeavors to seriously (and wittily) acknowledge its pedigree.__The James Bond franchise turns 50 with a stellar entry that fires on all cylinders as an action picture but also casts a modest glance backward to its illustrious past.__This is Bond like you've never seen him and a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond's ferocity and feeling. Skyfall is smashing, just smashing.
It frequently seems as though Jackson was less interested in making The Hobbit than in remaking his own fabulously successful Lord of the Rings series.__My first thought in watching The Hobbit was: Do we really need this movie? It was my last thought, too.__To its own narrative detriment, "The Hobbit" works hard to lay the framework for what will follow. Certainly that's one way to set out on a trilogy, but it's surely not the best.__There's no denying the majesty in Peter Jackson's visuals but he's taken a relatively slim children's book and stretched it beyond the limits.__The repeated iterations of fight, flight and respite here get wearing. Especially perhaps because, with Jackson's fetish for detail, they take more time to watch on screen than to read about.__"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" has finally arrived, not on wings of gossamer fancy but with a hairy-footed thud.__An overlong adventure enlivened by wonders.__An Unexpected Journey is a major comedown, a muddle-headed and cumbersome piece of filmmaking that betrays Jackson's mercenary motives -- Tolkien's book, too.__If you loved the earlier films, these are moments you will hold on to, but they're very few, and they're not enough.__Part One of director Peter Jackson's planned film trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit forces audiences to run an obstacle course before the fun kicks in.__Between its lighter tone and a decade's worth of improvements in digital film techniques, there should be enough of a novelty factor to delight most fans.__His first installment of The Hobbit, Tolkien's relatively slim precursor to the sprawling "Rings" saga, is a technically impressive but bloated adventure that makes you feel every one of its 169 minutes.__I was impressed with how much of the story's good humor Jackson and Co. manage to weave into the spectacle. It's there in the close shave with a gang of hungry trolls, and it really lifts off once Andy Serkis' uncanny Gollum enters the picture.__Tolkien's inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle.__The last hour of this movie is pretty much nonstop, and it's a gas.__Little about the storytelling suggests a beating heart beneath the visuals; once the journey has begun, the characters find themselves in life-threatening danger with stupefying regularity.__This is not about a reluctant hero drawing courage from some deep personal well. It's not about dread and danger. It's about visual effects.__"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is not the worst film of the year, but it may be the most disappointing.__I'm afraid that whoever it was in the New York Film Critics Circle who voted for "The Hobbit" as best animated film had a point. And so did the people who suspected that this whole thing was a bad idea.__The film is worthy of both your attention and of the Tolkien legendarium in which Jackson, his actors and his Weta Workshop technical crew are so firmly situated.
A feast of ripe dialogue and bloodsucking action.__The fifth and final entry in the historically successful "Twilight" franchise is the most self-aware and in some ways the most entertaining.__If anything, this series has gotten dumber and more inert as it has progressed, with this last one finally reaching over into an extended wallow in camp.__I'll probably never understand the popularity of the Twilight movies. They're haphazardly assembled adaptations of awful books.__You're going to hear a lot about Breaking Dawn Part 2 being the best of the Twilight movies. That's like saying a simple head cold is preferable to swine flu.__The 'Twilight Saga' has no upmarket aspirations. Seeking neither critical applause or peer-review awards, these movies, like those of Tyler Perry, seek only to provide unabashed satisfaction to those who believe in their characters.__A riotous showdown ... finds an absurdly ingenious way both to preserve and subvert the contentiously passive climax of Meyer's novel.__It's a movie so dull you might start yanking on your own head after about an hour.__After the laborious exposition of "Part 1," "Part 2" is able to reap the benefits, tying together some disparate threads and providing real action at the end.__The very title Breaking Dawn, Part 2 hints at what the movie, sadly, reveals to be the case: The Twilight franchise has overstayed its welcome.__The first "Twilight" film that could get non-fans' hearts pumping turns out to be the last.__Fans of the series, which has made more than $2 billion worldwide, will no doubt find it all terribly romantic and deeply meaningful. The rest of humanity will remain unmoved.__Despite the slow start Mr. Condon closes the series in fine, smooth style. He gives fans all the lovely flowers, conditioned hair and lightly erotic, dreamy kisses they deserve.__While parting involved no sorrow, it was sweeter than expected.__As billion-dollar Hollywood franchises go, this is one of the drawn-out dumbest. The stake through the heart comes not a moment too soon.__"Breaking Dawn, Part 2" doesn't end the series on an especially strong note, but it ends it. Let's count our blessings.__Full of pauses and intense looks and vague standing around ...__It's about as exciting as watching David Blaine play Stratego and makes you miss the power of the first four films all the more: the uncontainable yearning of the Bella-Edward-Jacob triangle.__With so many scenes of well-dressed vampires sitting or standing, stiffly, while Taylor Lautner or Robert Pattinson or Kristen Stewart passes another micro-slab of dialogue like a kidney stone, [Sheen's] overacting's greatly appreciated, thanks.__It made me realize that, as narratively lumpy as they can be, I like the Twilight films because they're really about the eternal movie romance of vampires at play.
Dumbed down, tarted up, and almost shockingly uninspired, it's the worst superhero movie since Green Lantern.__This is a grittier webslinger saga, led by a Peter Parker with swagger and angst and a tone defined more by emotional resonance than wide-eyed wonder. It still has plenty of fizz.__This might be a fun summer blockbuster if only it even remotely needed to exist.__The Amazing Spider-Man is considerably more fun-and, yes, even touching-than so premature a reboot had any right to be.__On the whole, it's passable stuff, a surprise, given how mechanical the masked character seemed.__If you've seen half a dozen superhero films, and the box office results suggest you have, then you've also seen what "The Amazing Spider-Man" has to offer.__At 28, Garfield's slightly older than Maguire was when he played Peter Parker in 2002, but his combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor is immediately appealing.__Here comes another Spider-dude: This Andrew Garfield guy. So he'd better be really something, right? Well, as it happens, he is.__This hugely elaborate production is supposed to be the reboot of a foundering franchise, but rebooting a computer wipes the silicon slate clean. In the movie, what's old is old again.__Brings fresh faces and 3-D bells and whistles to the adventures of a moody nerd-boy who gets bitten by a radioactive arachnid and morphs into a smart-talking, web-slinging, thug-busting superhero.__How amazing can it be? We all just saw this movie when "Spider-Man" came out a decade ago.__It's the most anonymous superhero film since Green Lantern.__It spends a lot of time improving Spidey's gear -- textured Spandex, stronger webbing -- but fails to do the one thing it was created to do: bring something new to a familiar tale.__Pretty good summer flick!__The idea that to be rendered superhuman is neither some sombre moral privilege nor a queasy Faustian temptation but a prelude to ungovernable slapstick might be just what the genre needs.__Now that all the fussy exposition has been taken care of, the real fun can begin in earnest: Long may he weave.__The Amazing Spider-Man is at least better than Raimi's Spider-Man 3, which was a mess.__It's a nice try, but you wish all this talent could bring us something we haven't seen before. Sorry, Spidey.__Mr. Webb's Spider-Man movie works only because he keeps the whole package, at least until the requisite final blowout, tethered to his two appealing leads.__With great stories come great responsibilities. This one doesn't measure up.
The main problem is that Merida craves adventure but Brave limits her to mother-daughter psychodrama.__By the climax, at which all right-thinking viewers will have dissolved in a puddle of warm appreciation, the new Pixar film has earned two cheers and a big bear hug.__The story for this revisionist fairy tale, which promotes contemporary attitudes about parenting and gender equality, is less inspired than usual for Pixar, but the movie upholds the studio's high standard of computer animation.__No, not another Pixar classic, but for full-on family fun it's a brave effort.__The story, with its patchwork of plots (involving feuding clans and disastrous spells), holds together enough to thrill intermittently.__Though it falls short of the studio's best in many respects, Brave is ravishing to look at. Merida's carrot corona is alone worth the price of admission.__The tone is uneven and more often morose than joyful. The pacing is slow and at times almost tedious. The end result is something that feels like it was put together from a jumble of Disney cliches tacked onto the skeleton of Beauty and the Beast.__Saying that Brave is entertaining but not astonishing is pretty much admitting your straight-A student got a B.__It's a safe experience; but safe, in this case, is better than sorry.__The Pixar name used to mean something. And it never quite meant pleasantly safe, safely forgettable movies like this.__"Brave" is easy to like but hard to love, a feel-good fable with the latest bells and whistles.__What we get would be fine from another studio, but too safe and familiar for Pixar.__"Brave" isn't a bull's-eye, but it's close enough.__This Celtic-themed story hews so closely to classic fairy-tale tropes, it's the studio's most Disney-fied production yet.__Youngsters with a taste for adventure will no doubt overlook the movie's workmanlike outlines and applaud its spirited, self-reliant heroine, who proves to be as appealingly unruly as her tumble of Titian curls.__It's a lively, psychologically astute tale filled with humanity, wit and charming performances.__It's a subpar story that seems to exist mainly to sell a new Disney Princess in the form of wild-haired Merida.__A charming but weightless adventure tale.__In terms of story and emotional power, "Brave" comes up short.__If the Walt Disney Studios logo were the only one on "Brave," this film's impeccable visuals and valiant heroine would be enough to call it a success.
Sure, MacFarlane, you can make us laugh, but it's time to grow up. Seriously.__Everything goes on too long -- Ted's carousing, Lori's watchful waiting, John's wistful indecision.__It's a goofy premise pursued with crass -- as well as sentimental -- relish.__You'll feel the warmth and camaraderie of a Bostonian and his little sentient bear.__I tried to resist but couldn't.__The idea of a toy that comes to life - and then won't go away - isn't a bad one. Too bad that "Ted" manages to overstay its welcome without ever really coming to life itself.__As unabashedly idiotic movie comedies go, Ted goes fairly well.__"Ted" is so lazy you want to kick the stuffing out of it.__Underneath the matted fur of the movie's foul-mouthed bear beats a very real heart.__The plot is simply a shaky frame on which to hang drug and sex jokes and numerous pop-culture references.__I expected "Ted" to be a one-joke movie, but it's got ideas spilling out of its seams.__What began as a promising, if unhinged, experiment in suspending disbelief starts to feel like "You, Me and Dupree" for plushies.__In a universe of Hollywood comedies that seem determined to insult the audience and pander to the basest form of post-adolescent fantasy, "Ted" feels almost sophisticated.__The natural interactions between Ted and his beloved man-child owner, John, terrifically played as an adult by Mark Wahlberg, are more often than not ridiculously funny.__Ted's real trick is turning a one-joke premise into a reasonable facsimile of a movie, and one that isn't entirely bent on grossing us out.__It is funny to watch a teddy bear wail on Mark Wahlberg. But afterward, I mostly felt beat up.__For all of its transgressive plush-toy sex and screw-'em humor, the plot is pretty standard stuff.__To fully appreciate "Ted," it's best to simply forgive its bad behavior upfront and save any apologies for liking it until later. Sorry.__I'm betting on Mark Wahlberg for best actor when the Oscars swing around next year.__Welcome to the funniest comedy of 2012.
____This is that rare thing: a franchise that grows more winning with each instalment.__From time to time the improbable occurs: A sequel outdoes its original.__The screenplay, by Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach, churns out the snappy witticisms with admirable creative gusto, but it whizzes along at such a frenetic pace that you'll probably miss half of them.__A fun and fast family entertainment.__The clever lines and themes of friendship and finding home are almost completely overwhelmed here by the breathless pace and sensory overload...__What might be barely tolerable in a seven-minute short gave me the biggest headache since "Transformers: Dark of the Moon.''__[It] may be the best of the bunch, simply because it busts the leash that tethers it to anything resembling reality.__Set at a frenzied pace meant to connote fun, it mostly feels like a frenetic spectacle.__Kids will be stimulated. And, parents, you'll enjoy the sights.__"Madagascar 3" is all about exuberant motion, cute characters and gorgeous colors. It aims for the eyes, not the heart.__A neon-saturated, high-flying trapeze act with enough frenetic funny business that it's a wonder the folks behind this zillion-dollar franchise about zoo critters on the lam didn't send the animals to the circus sooner.__A riot of splashy colors, silly 3-D gimmicks, big, broad kid-friendly gags - and those professionally pesky penguins.__Cascading, colorful 3-D performance sequences are sufficiently dazzling that you'll forgive the bajillionth soundtrack sampling of "Firework."__Your brain goes breathless and giddy struggling to keep up.__If you typically check the ingredients on the stuff you feed your kids, here is what you'll find in "Madagascar 3": jokes, Katy Perry music and less than 2 percent of character development and emotional warmth.__I have to give props to a movie that ascends from eccentricity to insanity without losing its footing.__Despite a script co-written by Noah Baumbach, "Madagascar 3" can't upgrade its own shtick, becoming a craven example of a fast-buck, no-fun family film.__It's silly, and it's lazy. And yet, again, it's pretty funny.
Disney's found a lot to play with here, but you may find yourself itching to take the controls.__You'll either love it or you'll admire it, while wishing it would calm down and, I don't know, maybe pick up a book for a while.__It's a cool game, to be sure, but watching someone else play it gets old after a while.__For anyone with a grade-schooler and a free Saturday, it's a pretty safe and painless bet. And a great excuse to go up to the attic later and see if you can dig out your old Atari 2600.__Unlike the Pixar films toward which it aspires-which marry sophisticated conceits to straightforward storylines-Wreck-It Ralph consistently gets lost in its own intricate plot mechanics.__'Wreck-it Ralph' is a serious contender for the title of best animated film of the year.__The movie's subversive sensibility and old-school/new-school feel are a total kick.__It's impossible not to feel a strong sense of nostalgic amusement, if not sheer delight, at the comings and goings of all these characters.__It's fun for awhile, but it's not a video game you'll come back to once you set down the controller.__Amid all the boring crashing and chasing and slapstick, there are some brilliant flashes of wit (particularly a reference to the guards in the Wizard of Oz).__Emphasizes action and eye-popping visuals over emotion.__'Wreck-It Ralph' combines a fresh idea with a true love for retro pop culture. It's hard not to love this movie.__Delightfully off the rails, offering a grown-up-friendly tone and merging of visual styles that are reminiscent of the studio's 1988 animated homage to film noir, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."__"Wreck-It Ralph" is a lot like video games and candy: light entertainment but fun while it lasts.__Wreck-It Ralph is the latest in a rash of recent movies fired up with imaginative risk. Director Moore brings a video junkie's passion to the movie game, and it's hilariously infectious.__It's a lovely pretext for dazzling visuals, yet the production is diminished by the clumsiness of an 8-bit script.__Like a video game, Rich Moore's 3-D film is colorful, noisy, and pixel-deep.__Wreck-It Ralph is pop nirvana, a headlong rush through classic arcade games and Nintendo standards that's not too busy playing spot-the-reference to keep from paying off in laughs and heart.__The movie invites a measure of cynicism - which it proceeds to obliterate with a 93-minute blast of color, noise, ingenuity and fun.__It's pure plastic product from plot line to the pro forma 3-D to the tidy moral lessons - ersatz family entertainment as disposable as it is diverting.
It's very good, but that's not the point. It's necessary.__'Lincoln' works as a snapshot of a great man without ever slipping into a portrait of sainthood.__This is movie magic -- history coming to life, before our eyes.__It's the most remarkable movie Steven Spielberg has made in quite a spell, and one of the things that makes it remarkable is how it fulfills those expectations by simultaneously ignoring and transcending them.__Lincoln paints a powerful and compelling portrait of the man who has become an icon. We don't need to see more of his life to understand how rare a figure he was - this window is more than sufficient.__Lincoln offers proof of what magic can happen when an actor falls in love with his character. Because as great as Day-Lewis has been in his many parts, he has never seemed quite so smitten.__The film masterfully captures the dual dilemmas facing the president in the final months of his life: how to bring the war between the states to an end, and how to eradicate slavery, once and for all.__Lincoln is a stirring reminder that politics can be noble. Might there be a lesson here for today's shrill D.C. discourse? 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.__Day-Lewis' voice is thin and reedy, which jibes with historical accounts but subverts our expectations. His attitude makes listeners lean in, and so do we, magnetized by his kindly reserve.__Spielberg is legendary for his visual feasts, yet he serves us this turkey with no relish. There's scarcely a memorable image in the entire film.__If it sounds like so much backroom politicking, it is. But it's exceptionally interesting, entertaining backroom politicking.__The true tussle of the movie, however, is between the Spielberg who, like a cinematic Sandburg, is drawn aloft toward legend and the Spielberg who is tugged down by Kushner's intricate screenplay toward documentary grit.__"A richly detailed interpretation of all the backroom deals, political horse- trading and compromises Lincoln and his allies had to make to put an end to slavery in America.__Lincoln is the work of a different director, one truly fascinated by why his subjects do what they do, one who invests each moment with the artistry he has often reserved for setpieces.__There are long stretches that are as quiet, contemplative, and austere as anything Spielberg has ever done.__Lincoln is a film about the arts of suasion-one that encompasses oratory and extortion, conciliation and conspiracy, arms twisted and cheeks turned. It is a film, in short, about politics.__Day-Lewis's Lincoln is the spiritual center of the film, but he's ringed by a multitudinous cast of characters.__For a man so funny, so vital, so literally larger than life, "Lincoln" remains a Daguerreotype - careful, quiet and dully framed.__Lincoln serves history better than it does the multiplex, and that's a brave and worthy thing in a time of slippery truths and splintered attention spans.__Its characters, people who lived long ago and who tended to be much more loquacious than a 140-character burst would allow, somehow seem to breathe the same air we do.
Django Unchained is 165 minutes and nothing much happens beyond talk and the provision of corpses. The plot lurches around and the artful structure of Pulp Fiction has been abandoned.__A film bursting with pleasures great and small ...__Django Unchained is Tarantino's most complete movie yet. It is also his most vital. His storytelling talents match the heft of the tale.__Django Unchained has mislaid its melancholy, and its bitter wit, and become a raucous romp. It is a tribute to the spaghetti Western, cooked al dente, then cooked a while more, and finally sauced to death.__Genre-movie-mad writer-director Quentin Tarantino's foray into Western World is a pretty grave disappointment.__Wildly extravagant, ferociously violent, ludicrously lurid and outrageously entertaining, yet also, remarkably, very much about the pernicious lunacy of racism and, yes, slavery's singular horrors.__Quentin Tarantino no longer makes movies; he makes trailers.__Django Unchained is the most brutal film Quentin Tarantino has ever made.But the movie is also exciting and ironic and, at times, explosively funny: Even at his most serious, Tarantino can't help but entertain and show you a good time.__"Django Unchained" possesses an unmistakable subversive power, its playfully insurrectionist spirit perhaps the modern-day pop-culture equivalent of far more high stakes rebellions of yore.__The name of the movie is "Django Unchained," but for all practical purposes it might as well be called "Tarantino Unleashed."__There's plenty of fun here - Waltz alone is worth the price of admission - but you may leave "Django Unchained" wishing for both more and less.__"Django Unchained" is the most consistently entertaining movie of 2012.__There's something about [Tarantino's] directorial delectation in all these acts of racial violence that left me not just physically but morally queasy.__Django Unchained is by turns exhilarating, hilarious, horrifying and poetic.__Corkscrewed, inside-out, upside-down, simultaneously clear-eyed and completely out of its mind.__It is digressive, jokey, giddily brutal and ferociously profane. But it is also a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.__With a fearless director and his mighty pen freeing a talented cast to attack a vital theme, "Django Unchained" is damnation unleashed.__No movie can match Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti Western/blaxploitation/southern when it comes to illustrating the carnage wrought by slavery.__Tarantino's sure-footed, gorgeously shot, darkly funny Western starts strong and gains in momentum until a breathtaking climax that represents the apogee of his adventures in culture-mashing.__[Tarantino] knows how to use our movie-conditioned anticipation against us. Watching his movie is like playing chess with a wiseguy friend who's always four moves ahead.
Yes, this is the part where I outsource my critical role to my children. If you are the kind of person who (quite understandably) abhors this particular gimmick, you may wish to stop reading now.__The best bits are basic and all but voiceless: those Scrat-intensive set pieces, still inspiredly squirrelly if much too far apart.__These films are generally good at being good enough, and the fourth installment, Ice Age: Continental Drift, doesn't deviate from that modest tradition.__In the end, this latest "Ice Age" movie is about as surprising and unpredictable as a glacier. And not much more fun.__Whenever I watch an "Ice Age" movie, I understand how my mother felt whenever I zoned out in front of the television after school.__Popping from one silly set piece to another is all that really concerns the screenwriters.__Logic may be extinct, but, boy, do these movies whiz by like ice cubes zipping across a linoleum floor.__The dialogue is sometimes too sluggish and definitely too preachy, the ending is a little too sappy, yet somehow this strange collection of prehistoric critters and their completely illogical life are consistently likable, if not quite lovable.__This fourth installment featuring the computer-animated, prehistoric critters is aimless and derivative. While the first Ice Age movie in 2002 was inventive and cute, there's far too little here that's fresh.__The plot ... just barrels forward with very few surprises.__Dinklage works hard, and his gold-toothed monkey mariner is amusingly designed, but it's not nearly enough to shake the sense that we're watching elaborate filler.__In a world where family flicks are split between the inspired and the insipid, it's time to let Manny and his mates drift out to sea.__They keep pumping out more "Ice Age" movies, as if it were some sort of "Rocky" for kids or something, and if they never reach the heights of the best animated fare, they chug along efficiently.__How many times do they need to reassert the message that family comes first and friends are forever?__It all would have been more enjoyable without all the treacle and pandering.__The filmmakers stuff the film to a manic degree, albeit with increasingly textured animation.__The frenetic pace masks an emptiness; this Ice Age is just a collection of slapstick moments and fisticuffs, with pauses for Sid to regurgitate food into his paw and show it to everyone.__"Continental Drift," like its predecessors, is much too friendly to dislike, and its vision of interspecies multiculturalism is generous and appealing.__It's not very funny, but your kids might like it. For the record.__The picture's a scream, courtesy of Scrat.
Theron gives the picture some spine. As Snow White, Kristen Stewart supplies the heart.__As far as live-action reimaginings of fairy tales are concerned, this is one of the more inventive ones and is unquestionably better than 2011's Red Riding Hood misfire.__Vastly superior to Mirror, Mirror in every way. Great work from Charlize Theron.__Sanders does not (yet) share Guillermo del Toro's gifts, but he, too, has an eye for the beautiful and the grotesque, and for that entrancing borderline where the two meet.__Only Bob Hoskins as the blind seer Muir comes close to making us care. We can almost glean Snow White's heroic possibilities through his clouded eyes. As much as we'd like to, we certainly can't from Stewart's efforts.__Some of the fairy tale effects are marvelous; but the odyssey from darkness to light is unduly long and sloggy, and Stewart, with her contemporary edge, seems to be acting in the wrong era.__"Snow White and the Huntsman," a solemn but mostly savvy rewrite, is a welcome upgrade.__A virtual orchard of toxic excess, starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters.__There are many splendid reasons to see Snow White and the Huntsman - enough, maybe, not to care that neither Snow White nor the Huntsman rank high among them.__Fails to realize the full potential of its ambitiously dark vision.__Is this movie trying to be "Excalibur" or "My Little Pony"?__Perhaps the best thing about "Snow White and the Huntsman" is it doesn't smirk at itself. It plays out as a story about mortality and greed and oppression in a fantastical world, but it doesn't act as if anything is silly.__There will be lots of versions of Theron's evil queen running around West Hollywood this Halloween; it's a performance that's one part Tilda Swinton to 30 parts Faye Dunaway, the sort of over-the-top craziness that spawns midnight screenings.__A slow, boring film that has no charm and is highlighted only by a handful of special effects and Charlize Theron's truly evil queen.__Stunningly shot and inconsistently acted and written, Snow White has enough visual fireworks to keep the film afloat, even if star Kristen Stewart can't get out of Twilight mode.__It is an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages. But what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate love - its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white.__The director sets a heart-pounding pace, pausing only for such interludes as Snow White's encounter with seven dwarfs who could not be more distant from their Disney forebears.__What dooms Snow White and the Huntsman is ultimately not how over the top it is, but how dull it is.__The film has the DNA of a blockbuster and the soul of a haunting folk tale. It is as dangerous, dark, intelligent and beautiful as its wraithlike villainess.__Snow White and the Huntsman has a darkness that seeps into the soul - but it's also definitely a missed opportunity. Director Rupert Sanders loses his nerve just when the story starts cooking.
Tom Hooper gets a bit carried away with swoopy shots, and the close-ups are unrelenting, but crucially he lets the filth and the squalor in.__Fans of the original production, no doubt, will eat the movie up, and good luck to them. I screamed a scream as time went by.__... Jackman, who should get a Nobel Prize for the way he carries pretty much the whole undertaking on his shoulders, so protean and virile is his singing and acting throughout.__At the heart of the "Les Miserables" movie was a good idea that just didn't work out this time. The idea was that the actors should sing their songs live on camera.__We're all familiar with the experience of seeing movies that cram ideas and themes down our throats. Les Miserables may represent the first movie to do so while also cramming us down the throats of its actors.__Committed fans of the musical are likely to have their affections reaffirmed. The less devout, however, may conclude that in this case more is less, and fidelity not always a virtue.__It lives in that kinda-sorta, okay-not-great, this-worked-that-didn't in-between for which words like "better" and "worse" fall woefully short.__If you like your musicals enormous, over the top and bang-on-the-head manipulative, "Les Miserables" is the movie for you.__By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat.__A few hours watching this adaptation and you may be one of the miserable ones, too.__Fans of the franchise will greet "Les Miserables" as a feast for the senses, but the rest of us are left with crumbs.__One of the most emotionally devastating and gratifying movies I've ever seen.__The music and the magnetic performances make many of the directorial missteps fade into the background.__After 2 1/2 hours, the movie's become a bowl of trail mix - you're picking out the nuts you don't like and hoping the next bite doesn't contain any craisins.__Despite its pitfalls, this movie musical is a clutch player that delivers an emotional wallop when it counts. You can walk into the theater as an agnostic, but you may just leave singing with the choir.__Jackman is performing in a drama, Crowe on his concert stage, and Hathaway alone in her room. It's a collection of performances rather than a story.__The piercing sincerity of this stupendous, heart-wrenching epic would move even the most jaded cynic. See it and weep.__An engaging version of a sweeping epic, an enduring tale of romance, sacrifice and heroism.__Victor Hugo's grim, but redemptive, classic novel is given resplendent new life on the big screen.__If you love Les Mis the stage musical, my guess is you will love what Hooper and his bustling company have done.
No one does saccharine like Adam Sandler. The man can be sharp, angry and funny - but when he lays on the sweetness, it's like drowning in an avalanche of Tate & Lyle.__It's all strictly one-note stuff. But it's a funny note, and the film has a grand old time giving us the same type of gag over and over again.__The 3-D adds a vertiginous thrill to a chase on flying tables and a touch of claustrophobia to a maze of underground corridors.__Not since Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein have the great Universal monsters been subjected to such dismal treatment.__Even the animation is ugly.__Hotel Transylvania may lack the emotional oomph of Pixar's best efforts, but it makes up for it with rapid-fire gags and an unflagging pace that makes this a rare all-ages treat.__A fast, funny and wildly inventive animated tale with enough laughs and heart to appeal to audiences of all ages.__The film is good goofy fun, even as the plot uncorks a whole lotta nothing.__"Hotel Transylvania" may offer a perfectly fine Halloween-themed getaway for young kids, but there aren't many amenities for Mom and Dad.__[Tartakovsky's] wit and attention to detail enliven a collection of well-known ghosts and ghouls.__It won't drive you crazy to watch it, but it isn't "The Lion King" either.__Feels like a string of jokes without a story.__This comedy starring and produced by Adam Sandler feels as slapped together one of the comedian's live-action buddy movies.__While it's an energetic romp, there is more slapstick humor than wit at work here, and a good deal of borrowing from the far more clever Monsters, Inc.__Every generation of trick-or-treaters deserves its monster mash.__The movie loses its originality as it rolls toward its predictable conclusion, but it's still lovely to look at.__There's much to enjoy here in a disposable way, particularly jokes about monsters having ordinary problems with kids and spouses.__"Hotel Transylvania" never becomes the great monster mash that seemed in the offing.__At its core, this movie is little more than Twilight told from the other side of the tracks, only with far more fart jokes.__There's enough here to entertain - and gross out - the kiddie crowd, and parental units, too.
A sloppy, lazy, unintentionally laughable sequel.__A meta-American movie, a Godardian spoof of the whole genre, an attempt to see how stupid and insulting a motion picture can be and still be a big hit.__Taken 2 is more of the same, except a little bigger, a little dumber, and a little less invigorating.__So lazily put together that it relies on flashbacks from its predecessor for the majority of its character development.__Neeson, despite having turned 60 in June, looks spritely enough in the role, and more than capable of another go-round should Taken 2 match its predecessor's success.__As much as this picture is action driven, its greatest delights are grounded in personality, in the fun of having a protagonist who combines homespun values with velociraptor functionality.__Neeson is once again the stalwart center of this giddy, entirely improbable and improbably enjoyable escapade.__A sequel every bit as clumsy, ham-handed, outlandish and laughable as the original was sleek, tough and efficient.__There doesn't seem to be a whole lot at stake in a movie where you can crash your way through the armed barricades at the American embassy with a stolen taxicab and survive without a scratch.__The one thing that comes across is Neeson's character really likes fighting Albanians.__"Taken 2" is nearly all nonsense, with villains so inept and slow-moving that there's little satisfaction in watching Mills take them out.__Just a mediocre action franchise with a solid actor at the head and a travelogue in its heart.__The first thing to be kidnapped is logic, as the action moves to Istanbul from Paris and Liam Neeson ridiculously reprises his role of avenging ex-CIA dad Bryan Mills.__As they might say in the advertising department, it's an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride. But it could have been much more.__[Neeson's] acting makes him seem human and even vulnerable, someone we can't help but worry over even though it's those feckless Albanians we should be nervous about.__Seems like a nonstop car and foot chase, with Albanian after Albanian falling victim to Bryan's remarkable aim and hand-fighting skills.__Rigorously formulaic and far-fetched ...__Taken 2 must not be taken 2 seriously, although at the very least Megaton could have found better ways to use all those glorious, antique-looking Istanbul backdrops.__Why an actor of Neeson's ability would play this character once, let alone twice, is a mystery for the ages.__If a viewer enjoyed the exotic locale and fast-paced action in the original film, here they get a different city and even more amped-up happenings, with a plot that intrigues enough to reel a viewer in.
The late-eighties TV series is rebooted with jolts of sentiment, personal discovery, and wild comedy.__The whole crew makes clear its affections for action cinema, trashy television and the YouTube generation alike while having fun at the expense of all three.__A raucous, raunchy comedy.__This bracing new take on 21 Jump Street has a playful spark all its own. It's a blast.__A try-anything, fitfully amusing muddle that wears its mocking cynicism a bit too proudly.__"21" makes clear from the beginning it is gobbling up some pop culture refuse in the name of nothing more than making fun of it and having fun with it.__This is the funniest movie I've seen in more than a year.__"21 Jump Street" might be yet another product of Hollywood's recycling program, but it deserves to be noticed.__I didn't think we needed a '21 Jump Street,' but it's actually kind of funny.__Miller and Lord clearly understand the push-and-pull and hyper-competitiveness that make guy friendships both complex and stupid.__It's that rare comedy that's funny throughout, with a hilarious story that hinges on the unlikely pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.__The basic premise -- that these two are supposed to be high school age and siblings -- is funny, but the joke, as is true of many others in this movie, is replayed way too often.__21 Jump Street makes a virtue of low expectations, like an underachieving high school burnout coasting on his modest reserves of charm.__This cheerfully chaotic, gleefully vulgar action-comedy retread of the old television series has box-office success written all over it, and where's the harm? It's irresistibly funny until it isn't.__It was inevitable that one of Hollywood's many recent reboots would eventually attain sentience. Hence the arrival of 21 Jump Street, a film that not only knows it's a remake, but knows how absurd it has to be to succeed as a remake.__"21 Jump Street" thrilled me to itsy-bitsy elated pieces.__Neither man has had a better foil. They are literally and figuratively trying to bring something out of each other, and they do.__This film is even better if you come in with no spoilers and low expectations, so we will build it up no more.__This potty-mouthed and drug-laced reimagining of the 1980s TV show has one of the highest laughs-per-minute ratios since the Naked Gun films.__Tatum and Hill steamroller any misgivings right from the start. They take a comedy connection that seemed doomed to fail - pairing Tatum's hunky command with Hill's nerdy neediness - and make it look like the most natural thing in the world.
Let's just say that the movie's final section is so nail-bitingly tense, thanks to a skillful combination of acting, writing and crosscutting, that it puts Affleck in the big leagues as a director.__Entertaining and suspenseful in old-fashioned ways.__Affleck himself turns in a quietly impressive movie star performance. Tony Mendez is a kind of anti-Bourne, comfortable with his anonymity, living off his wits, not his fists.__With Affleck's continued growth as a director, it makes you want to see what he will deliver next.__For 100 minutes, 'Argo' is close to flawless.__'Argo' is one of the best movies of the year.__Argo has that solid, kick-the-tires feel of those studio films from the 70s that were about something but also entertained. Only it's as laugh outright amusing as it is sobering.__The movieland satire is laid on thick, but it's also deadly accurate. Schlock has never seemed so patriotic, and Arkin and Goodman have rarely been so good.__Argo is a rollicking yarn, easily the most cohesive and technically accomplished of Affleck's three films so far, but a part of me wishes the director hadn't cast himself in the lead role.__If nothing else, it proves that every so often, the CIA can pull something off - and that yes, Canadians are just about the nicest people on the planet.__The film is a whopper of a tale, one designed for Oscar nominations, Best Picture and Best Director among them.__Argo is a movie of many parts, the sum of which can probably be best described as enjoyable Hollywood hokum.__It's a well-told story that's timely, topical and thoroughly entertaining.__It may not have a lot beyond its outrageous story, but the story is undeniably a doozy, and the movie is a blast.__If you didn't know otherwise, you'd swear this was the work of a veteran master like Steven Soderbergh.__It's serious and substantive, an ingeniously written and executed drama fashioned from a fascinating, little-known chapter of recent history.__Even though most people know the outcome, this movie still will have you on the edge of your seat.__The movie is accomplished enough to stand alongside the 1970s political thrillers that inspired it, right down to the vintage red-and-black Warner Bros. logo that opens the film.__Fusing suspense and humor in a political thriller is a tricky prospect, but Argo is more than up to the task.__Ben Affleck doesn't merely direct Argo, he directs the hell out of it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense. There's no doubt he's crafted one of the best movies of the year.
Writer-director Russell is just the guy to bring out (and then calm) the manic dysfunction in these folks.__It's a rom-com that succeeds in revitalizing that discredited genre where so many others have failed, injecting it with the grit and emotion of realist drama rather than with amped-up whimsy or social satire or montages of people walking on the beach.__Silver Linings Playbook tells us that happily-ever-after may depend on finding people who coexist with our lunacy, not ones who can lead us out of it. In any case, it's crazy good.__A crazy beaut of a comedy that brims with generosity and manages to circumvent predictability at every turn.__An edgy romantic dramedy that suits our anxious times.__This meaningful film keeps the laughs, giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer and sustains it all through two full hours of a love story.__Lawrence, in her most high-low, sad-comic turn yet, is remarkable.__It shouldn't work - there's just too much going on. But it does. Spectacularly. Go see it.__Just about everybody in the cast of David O. Russell's strange and disturbing and deeply romantic new film has the chance to act with a capital A.__There's nothing wrong with the overrated Jennifer Lawrence that some serious acting lessons couldn't improve. The rest of the actors are pretty much on their own.__For a movie that seems at times to have no idea what it's trying to do, "Silver Linings Playbook" is compulsively watchable.__Sharp of tongue, generous of spirit, Silver Linings Playbook is a jagged, loopy romantic comedy about "crazy" people that insists, deep down, we're all a little nuts.__"The Silver Linings Playbook" defies categorization: it's both comedy and drama, without fitting neatly into either genre.__Going deep without resorting to trick plays, the sure-handed "Silver Linings Playbook" scores on every possession.__Some movies are so likable, so naturally charming, that you'll forgive any dopey idea they throw at you.__David O. Russell has pulled off a tricky feat here, finding just the right tone in crafting a romantic comedy whose sweethearts suffer from bipolar disorder and depression.__Silver Linings Playbook isn't perfect - the ending is untidy - but it may just be the year's best comedy.__Pretty much a miscalculation from beginning to end.__Tinged with shadows and ignited by Lawrence and Cooper, Silver Linings Playbook raises the bar on romantic comedy. It's crazy good.__It's lopsided and spotty, but it's alive in a way that suddenly makes you remember to what degree most Hollywood movies aren't.
Prometheus is scary only in the sum of instincts and talent for movie-making that have been lost.__The movie may be a scare show that leaves many questions unanswered, but Scott's craft earns an exhausted kind of respect.__Brilliant. Epic. Haunting. Grotesque. Great.__The setup is familiar-the mysterious planet, the slick tunnels, the shocking bodily violation, the broken quarantine, etc. So why is there a gaping hole where the dread should be?__Prometheus tells a much bigger story and does it well, but it's missing what matters most. It's inorganic.__There's definite mastery here, but it's hardly a masterpiece.__Prometheus--like, in its telling, the human race itself--is a creation spliced from the DNA of superior forebears.__Much like Rutger Hauer's turn as a replicant in Scott's Blade Runner, Fassbender's performance may launch Prometheus into the cult stratosphere.__I'll say this much for it -- it's not boring.__Ridley Scott means to bring wonder and horror back to summertime spectacle, and Prometheus mostly succeeds in that regard. (Mostly.)__"Prometheus" has the integrity of a serious and sincere attempt, but ultimately it won't please anybody.__With its creepy caves and yawning space, "Prometheus" is on one level a somber dialogue between man the aspirant and man the mortal.__"Prometheus" is genuinely epic.__Visually impressive and featuring one or two breakout performances, this anticlimactic exercise too often plays as though it has been cobbled together from archetypes, imagery and tropes from countless other movies.__Prometheus is more interested in piling on big questions than in answering them. It's deep without being particularly smart, although the dazzling design and special effects keep you from noticing that basic flaw until at least an hour in.__When it comes to technical wizardry and sheer visual spectacle, Prometheus unequivocally delivers.__If you have fond, 33-year-old memories of averting your young eyes from a propulsive parasite critter, Prometheus might just be your kind of return trip.__What resonates in Scott's graceful, grownup, pristine film is its majestic mind.__This tale of an interstellar search asks cosmic questions about the meaning of life, but comes up with lame answers in a script that screams attention-deficit disorder.__The ending isn't squishy scary or deeply satisfying. Bummer. Otherwise, Prometheus kicks ass so hard and often that it's impossible not to be thrilled by it.
The film's super-saturated look and quick cutting are mere substitutes for any real sense of intrigue.__While director Espinosa hones in on the ambiguous battle between Weston's idealism and Frost's cynicism, British cinematographer Oliver Wood - who filmed the last two Bourne movies - shoots the hell out of everything.__This is a naive director with so little insight you wonder what comic books he's been reading.__I won't deny that the movie hooked me with sheer brute energy and dragged me along with it most of the way.__Nothing really new here, but the cast is first-rate.__"Safe House" has just enough bone density to emit some satisfying cracks and pops whenever the action gets going.__Whatever its flaws, the film gives you no chance to get bored.__"Safe House" is a safe bet if you're in the market for a conspiracy-driven action drama. There are times you wish it wasn't quite so safe, but it does deliver the bang for your bucks.__While other stars of his generation stoop to self-parody, Washington stands tall. We cannot tell a lie: Yes, he makes us nervous, but in a good way.__As fun as the movie occasionally is, it can't make its own drama convincing, much less give Reynolds the nudge he needs toward Matt Damon-ville.__"Safe House" may strike you as a brilliant movie, provided you've seen fewer than, say, 10 spy thrillers. I've seen more than 10 spy thrillers.__A movie with a double-crossing intelligence plot that's so generic it's an irritating intrusion in a lively chase through the streets and shantytowns of Cape Town, South Africa.__It's pretty good.__"Safe House" is an idea for a movie.__Washington's Tobin is a pedantic cipher and Reynolds' Weston a dull Dudley Do-Right, and the resulting mix, apart from a few good chases, is bland enough to bottle for Gerber's.__The scenes of fighting, shooting, and car-chasing are all quite breathtaking, but you'll be twitching for the fast-forward button during the seemingly endless sequences of plot development and dialogue that connect all the thrilling stuff together.__"Safe House" is a sturdy enough thriller, but one that consistently defaults to the less interesting of its two lead characters.__It ... shows how much can be done with a business-as-usual CIA-thriller script when it's bolstered by effective acting and expert direction.__Excellent performances from both Washington and Reynolds can't can't save Safe House from its boilerplate-thriller bones.__Safe House is a bracing action thriller made all the more watchable because of its two lead performances.
The Vow is a welcome antidote to cynicism, and a bracing tonic that proves love hasn't disappeared from the film experience completely.__The Vow makes the least of its concept, refusing to acknowledge that a love need not be perfect to merit holding on to.__The two stars look dewy and glossy and unexceptional, bound together less by chemistry than by the ministrations of a hard-working costume designer.__'The Vow' is inspired by a true and wonderful story, but that doesn't make the fictionalized version any less ridiculous.__Tatum is unusually expressive; Speedman, both hiss-worthy and sympathetic. But McAdams is the real draw.__As usual, Channing Tatum looks sweet and dull and, in most scenes, slightly confused.__The strong stench from The Vow is likely to overwhelm the smell of popcorn in movie theaters this weekend.__The kind of featherweight fare that is enjoyed in the moment and forgotten soon after the end credits roll.__It's pleasant enough as a date movie, but that's all.__Sucsy works within the trappings of a typical cheesy romance but finds realism in the details and the banter.__It's a shame things are so black and white, because the movie has more promise - and more laughs - than trailers suggest.__This film, with its would-be crowd-pleasing contrivances and rote adherence to formula, offers almost no redeeming characteristics.__More than willing to comfort anyone with a fuzzy grasp on real-world romance that the pretty people will make it through somehow, with no scars too deep.__If I get in a car accident, suffer a traumatic head injury, and emerge from a coma to find Channing Tatum telling me that he's my husband, I'm just going to go with it. Even if I don't recognize him.__"The Vow" is a cinematic box of candy wrapped in bright red cellophane. Like any box of chocolates, you have to bite a lot of bad centers to get to the few good ones.__This is a movie that leaves you wanting more. To care more, to cry more, to love more.__The Vow promises tried-and-true rom-com formula and delivers, treading in sappy, cliche-ridden turf.__It's unashamedly escapist, but a turn for the serious as The Vow nears the finish line only underscores its essential silliness...__Not even Channing Tatum's bare bum, clearly a Hail Mary pass lobbed at the ladies in the theatre, can distract from the turgidly sappy goings on in The Vow.__The best thing in the film is McAdams, who moves through her post-amnesia scenes with a plausible mix of good humor and wariness.
Veteran filmmakers will warn you, don't film at sea and don't work with animals. Ang Lee built a vast tank in Taiwan and he whips up awesome storms. [However,] watching the water here is more rewarding than watching the characters.__Flawed, yes, but marvellously ambitious, and unforgettably gorgeous to look at.__Mr. Lee's film is stronger as a visual experience-especially in 3-D-than an emotional one, but it has a final plot twist that may also change what you thought you knew about the ancient art of storytelling.__There's an audience out there for this movie, but the question is whether they will find it.__The movie's energy peters out in a series of book-club conversations about divine will, the power of storytelling, and the resilience of the human spirit.__A movie that can't be dismissed because there is too much in it but can't be embraced because it's all spread too thin.__This transcendent fable carries a real sting in its tail. Ang Lee has made a bold and wondrous movie, one of his best.__Claudio Miranda's luminous camera, set to Mychael Danna's intoxicating score, captures all manner of wild delights.__Don't wait for Netflix. Life of Pi demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can find.__Shelve your dislike of 3D glasses. Quiet your nattering criticism of CGI. Because Lee and his able crew wield those tools like wands.__Everything looks beautiful in Life of Pi.__Like that other "unfilmable" novel, Cloud Atlas, it has, of course, been turned into a movie -- with rather happier results.__Ang Lee's signature style -- tasteful, measured, and devoid of personality -- translates surprisingly well to 3-D.__Every once in a long while, the right director comes across the right project at just the right moment, and things so often discordant fall into perfect harmony.__Pi's story makes you believe why Pi would believe in God, sacrificer of innocents, tester of souls, creator of rapturous beauty.__"Pi" is a wonder to see; too bad it's not wondrous to feel.__"Life of Pi," even more so on the screen, is a dream to help us keep the nightmares at bay.__It's more compelling to focus on Lee's visceral cinematic experience than on the larger, fuzzier messages Martel's story conveys about humanity's connection with God.__Though the film's setup trudges and its closing is too pat, that hour or so on the raft is something special, and few would dive into the story's soul as Lee does.__"Life of Pi" both draws the audience in and encourages it to settle back, the better to enjoy its virtually nonstop display of daring, wonder and cinematic virtuosity.
Soderbergh has created a spicy yet lucid, surgingly high-energy yet smartly modernistic musical.__Tatum, whose talents have been the subject of debate, also makes Mike genuinely affecting, not to mention articulate within the bounds of a sketchy script.__Does a better job of mixing Chippendales-style guilty pleasures with reality-based cautionary tales than you might expect.__The dance numbers, choreographed by Allison Faulk, are inventive and athletic, but not really erotic; Soderbergh never lets you forget that, for these men, dancing is above all a job.__Magic Mike has a conventional structure, yet a teasing question percolates beneath: If selling yourself is as much fun as this movie makes it look, what could be wrong with it?__If you're looking for a romance with 100 percent prime beefcake? Get your singles out and ready, ladies. "Magic Mike" is in the house.__Soderbergh's direction - he's also the cinematographer - is largely loose-limbed, the film enlivened with bravura moments, including a decidedly spacey, eye-twisting orgy scene near the end.__What Soderbergh and producer/star Tatum are shooting for here is a portrait of a subculture, and that portrait crackles with energy.__It's one of the year's best surprises, and so is its frequently underrated star.__Steven Soderbergh's breezy dramedy serves up something for every taste.__It's a nicely balanced blend of comedy, drama and athletic dancing that plies its trade with winking, unforced self-assurance.__"Magic Mike" is so much better than it needs to be that it's sick.__An entertaining workplace comedy with a dark (and well-oiled) underbelly and some predictable romance to leaven the raunch and swagger.__At the very least, it is exceptional and one of the best and most original pictures to come along in 2012.__If filmmaker Soderbergh had paid as much attention to relationship dynamics as he does to dance number mechanics, this film would have gotten closer to living up to the magic in its name.__Half wish-fulfillment fantasy, half after-school special, Magic Mike is in many ways an unserious movie -- but like many of Soderbergh's slicker entertainments, it's not without its moments of substance.__Riddled with show-biz cliches, stick-figure studs and re-heated ideas, Magic Mike thrusts its junk in your face despite having a very empty G-string.__A weirdly guilty pleasure.__A smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatum's heat and charm - and ambitions that are as transparent as Mike's - with Mr. Soderbergh's cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.__Though Tatum's moves will put butts in the seats, it's his blues that brings a surprisingly dramatic twist to all that sweaty flesh.
Shares crucial DNA with the earlier films but is drawn from the shallower end of the gene pool.__Perhaps the most interesting question arising from The Bourne Legacy is just how long the filmmakers hope to trade on the Bourne name without any, you know, Bourne.__Renner and Weisz work well together as two hunted souls who initially need each other for utilitarian reasons.__Gilroy's a fine writer - he also penned Michael Clayton - but without the discipline of an action veteran like Greengrass to rein him in, he indulges his weakness to over-explain things.__It's twists and turns and nothing else. And fast and furious as it may be, if this is the best this once-smart series has to offer, this is no legacy.__The Bourne Legacy is one of Alfred Hitchcock's "refrigerator movies," in that it succeeds pretty well "in the moment" but starts to fall apart when considered in retrospect.__The movie's last hour or so squanders these rich narrative possibilities in an incoherently plotted, generically action-packed anticlimax.__Gilroy keeps the Bourne mythology firmly intact while moving it forward, and leaves the door open for just about anything in the future.__This is a talky, draggy thriller, muddled by flashbacks and woefully low on action.__Bourne fans will find much to enjoy about The Bourne Legacy, even if they are forced to do without the title character.__Renner and the audience deserve better.__Gilroy has brought characteristic taste and skill to a nearly impossible task: embracing the past without completely erasing it, thereby creating an invitingly complicated and open-ended future.__It all but squanders Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, although with actors less appealing, "The Bourne Legacy" would be even worse.__Complex, unexpected and dazzling, alternating relentless tension with resonant emotional moments, this is an exemplary espionage thriller that has a strong sense of what it wants to accomplish and how best to get there.__A brisk and challenging film.__Can a Bourne-again movie succeed without Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, without Bourne himself, and without a Robert Ludlum book as the production's turn-by-turn guide? Yes, it can.__"The Bourne Legacy" makes the most of its inheritance and sets the stage for a long, rich genealogy to come.__Gilroy, who's had a hand in writing the previous three films in the franchise, cleverly overlaps the events of this chapter with those of The Bourne Ultimatum.__Seeing a Bourne film for the plotting feels like reading Playboy for the articles, but if that's your thing, this is your movie.__A momentum-driven thriller that depends less on star power than on epic action sequences.
Surely the silliest outing for Caine since he swatted rampaging killer bees in the 1978 disaster flick "The Swarm."__Offers giant rocks clearly made of Styrofoam and Dwayne Johnson, who fits the same description.__I swear some of the giant, Day-Glo vegetation had "Property of 'Lost in Space'" stamped on it.__The equivalent of those pre-made sandwiches you buy at Starbucks -- not bad for you, and not entirely lacking in flavor, but nothing particularly memorable, either.__The equivalent of throwing "Jurassic Park," "Avatar" and the absolute worst episode ever of "Land of the Lost" in a blender and pushing "garble."__The Mysterious Island is everything a 12-year-old boy could want - endless adventure involving a reckless adolescent hero, with a pretty girl in a clinging T-shirt around to watch him struggle.__You know we're in serious trouble when even old pros such as Michael Caine and Luis Guzman can't do anything with the uninspired and unfunny script.__Sincerely tries to pay homage to the likes of Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson but is too contaminated by today's tame sensibilities to make it fly.__A wretched shipwreck of a film that will appeal only to young minds of the most limited discernment and imagination.__Journey 2: The Mysterious Island makes a nice case to your kids that reading books is a good idea.__Don't expect anything resembling believability, but enjoy the blend of strikingly colorful visuals and banter between odd couple Johnson and Caine, which combine for a mild escapist treat.__A brainless 3-D sequel to 2008's brainless 3-D "Journey to the Center of the Earth."__The usual escape-before-the-big-blast stuff ensues, augmented by some fairly tedious family dynamics.__The island locale rings with reggae music regardless of its proximity to Jamaica, and any action sequence is rendered in painfully deliberate slo-mo.__Blithely idiotic...__Even by the unambitious standards of some children's movies and many movies that star Caine, this one has a difficult time making a case for itself as anything other than an adventure in baby-sitting.__Harkens back to so-bad-they're-fun '70s children's epics like "At the Earth's Core" and "The Land That Time Forgot."__...the best that moviegoers who don't much enjoy genial sci-fi/fantasy silliness can expect is a relatively inoffensive time...__Anyone old enough to have read Jules Verne or seen the way his work was successfully adapted in the past will suffer worse than the kids in the audience who just came to laugh.__It's only disguised as fun.
Less-than-compelling storyline.__Rise of the Guardians is harmless enough, and the lack of easy pop-culture jokes represents the post-Shrek direction of DreamWorks well enough. But this is the studio's least entertaining film.__The conceit has its charms but too much of this movie, directed by Peter Ramsey, is more clamorous than inspired, and little kids might find parts of it too scarily intense.__'Rise of the Guardians' is an effervescent dose of fantasia that's pretty hard to dislike. Unless, of course, you're a cynical grump.__The script seems to have been written by committee, with members lobbying for each major character, and the action, set in vast environments all over the map, spreads itself so thin that a surfeit of motion vitiates emotion.__Too cluttered and manic to bring real pleasure.__A children's fable reimagined as a superhero flick--a peculiar but delightful hybrid that just may be the best animated offering of the year.__Like most children's movies, Rise of the Guardians mimics the patterns of adult entertainment. Where is the magic in that?__And as much as I often found myself enchanted by this 3D animated film, based on the series of books by William Joyce, I couldn't help noticing that this movie falls into a conundrum I like to call "You didn't clap loud enough -- Tinkerbell's dead."__All this feels formulaic and the believe-in-magic message is even more treacly than typical, but give first-time feature director Peter Ramsey credit for his visual panache.__A satisfying holiday treat for adults and children alike.__The Guardians make a winning team that is a prime candidate for a sequel, just like "The Avengers."__The joy of Peter Ramsey's clever and well-paced film is how it maintains its focus on the experience of childhood wonder rather than on holiday loot.__"Rise of the Guardians" seems a sure bet for kids who still believe - or wished they believed - in magic.__You'll perhaps need a little patience to fully appreciate Rise of the Guardians, which is likely to grow in stature over time.__The movie's bid for distinctiveness works in lots of little ways ...__Rise Of The Guardians boasts a great deal of visual energy and amounts to a lot of fun ...__[A] dour animated adventure that aspires to holiday joy, but is as enjoyable as a sock full of coal.__A charming if slightly dark and cobwebbed animated feature about how believing in something makes it real, or real enough.__This 3-D cartoon manages to be frantic and bizarre, yet boring.
If you like World War II films, you'll enjoy this.__What's striking is the absence of triumphalism -- Bigelow doesn't shy away from showing the victims shot down in cold blood in the compound -- and we come away with the overwhelming sense that this has been a grim, dark episode in our history.__This is an instant classic.__Chastain makes Maya as vivid as a bloodshot eye. Her porcelain skin, delicate features and feminine attire belie the steel within.__No doubt Zero Dark Thirty serves a function by airing America's dirty laundry about detainee and torture programs, but in its wake, there's a crying need for a compassionate Coming Home to counter its brutal Deer Hunter.__While "Zero Dark Thirty" may offer political and moral arguing points aplenty, as well as vicarious thrills,as a film it's simply too much of a passable thing.__From the very first scenes of Zero Dark Thirty, director Kathryn Bigelow demonstrates why she is such a formidable filmmaker, as adept with human emotion as with visceral, pulse-quickening action.__Unlike too many films these days, "Zero Dark Thirty" dares to embrace complexity. And that makes it not just state-of-the-art entertainment, but a great film.__A timely and important reminder of the agonizing human price of zealotry.__Not only is Zero Dark Thirty one of the year's best movies, it's an inspiring one to share with your daughters. That is, if they're old enough to deal with explicit torture scenes.__What the film says about getting information from terrorism suspects in an era of high-tech surveillance depends on your point of view. What is unquestionable is how powerful its full scope is.__Bigelow's extensive staging of the May 1, 2011, raid is a prime example of virtuoso action filmmaking.__Even more than The Hurt Locker, which sometimes relied on traditional film techniques to build suspense, Zero Dark Thirty resists manipulating the viewer or building movie-movie excitement.__One of the most innovative and best made films of the past year. Every now and then, even Dick Cheney gets to like a great movie.__[It] isn't easy viewing - but just try to look away.__[It's]a harrowing adventure behind the headlines that is at once a riveting procedural and, at the same time, a bracing political statement on the moral ambiguities of our war on terror.__Its stance is extremely tricky. It's not a documentary. It's not a load of revenge nonsense. It's not "24." I'm still arguing with myself over parts of it.__"Zero Dark Thirty" is a great movie, an astonishing achievement on nearly every level.__Swift, smart, relentless, Zero Dark Thirty compresses a decade of high-stakes procedural into 157 minutes of pure momentum.__As a hugely compressed account of the Osama bin Laden manhunt, as a compelling but troubling look at "black ops" tradecraft, and as a riveting portrait of a fiercely determined woman working in a male-dominated sphere, the film is a resounding success.
'Flight' is predictable in its plotting and soft in its conclusions. But thanks to that dynamite opening and Washington's effortless performance, it's also an enjoyable, compelling slice of old-school melodrama.__At a certain point, great actors want to show us the truth of something that may be far from their lives but that somehow they understand, intimately, all too well.__Flight is a well-made motion picture, but not a fun or entertaining one.__Denzel Washington gives one of his most nuanced and impressive performances.__This is Washington's movie from beginning to end, and full of little layers.__It succeeds as a carefully balanced cocktail of uppers and downers, of the type favored by its hero. You'll have a good night out, even if you don't remember it in the morning.__An old-fashioned drama and all the better for it.__A straightforward morality play crossed with a pretty good nail-biter.__This movie is captivating until it gets uplifting - Flight soars when it crashes and crashes when it soars.__It's a well-made movie. But after its opening, harrowing action sequence, the film turns into one of the most familiar stories of our time - a downward addiction and denial spiral.__Zemeckis reins in the story's potential for moralizing and melodrama, instead delivering a refreshingly sophisticated, mature human drama.__It's 150 minutes long, goes by in a shot, and for at least 135 minutes, it's a thoroughly engrossing experience.__Flight reminds us of what Washington can do when a role hits him with a challenge that would floor a lesser actor. He's a ball of fire, and his detailed, depth-charged, bruisingly true performance will be talked about for years.__Shameless, though effective, melodrama.__A solid, often engrossing film that doesn't engage us overall the way Denzel Washington's work does.__One of the big reasons Flight is so satisfying is that it moves with the no-frills, meat-and-potatoes conventions of a first-rate procedural while being awash in ambiguity.__The image of the heroic he-man, so entrenched in Hollywood mythology, takes an intriguing detour with Flight.__Washington sells the hollow confidence of a practiced dissembler, and he conjures enough vulnerability and pure charm to make us wince as he circles the drain.__The film tackles serious issues of addiction, legal intrigue and personal responsibility, with Denzel Washington in top form as a heroic yet morally compromised protagonist.__Just a couple of hours with Washington reclining within the contours of a role until a piece of cardboard becomes a character.
For what amounts to a feature-length ad, this is surprisingly entertaining.__Drastically overlong, burdened by too many stories about too many couples who are too one-dimensional to be relatable.__"Think Like a Man" is a surprisingly engaging, entertaining and very funny movie.__The more this alleged romantic comedy begs you to adore it, the more you wish you could block its calls.__The execution almost overcomes the thinking in "Think Like a Man." Almost.__It seeks to rescue contemporary black storytelling from the clutches of men in drag and misogynist moralizing.__Yes, this movie urges women to "Think Like a Man." But it thinks like an infomercial - and for a pretty old-fashioned product.__Despite the crass book promotion, the overlong film is harmless romantic fun that's well played.__Pleasantly sitcom-ish - kind of a knowing, urbane variation on the sort thing that would get more earnest treatment from Tyler Perry.__While using the book as a plot catalyst is certainly not a bad approach to constructing a fictional story from the material, the movie is bogged down from the get-go with too many bits of business and a very lengthy setup.__Though it is funny - at times, laugh-out-loud funny - this comedy is by and for adults.__A running joke is that Mr. Harvey has thrown men under the bus by giving away their secrets. But, gents, if they were secrets they wouldn't be cliches.__Even though Think Like a Man espouses something akin to the philosophy in Beyonce's Single Ladies(Put a Ring on It), it makes manipulation more fun than it ought to be.__There's not a single conversation that isn't about the mechanics of dating, or some other issue of conflict between the genders, but this cast is so uniformly engaging and charismatic that they make the whole thing work.__I'm not going to claim this is a good movie, in some Platonic-ideal way...__The script ultimately resorts to just counting off comic beats as it creaks through its unfathomable two-hour running time.__"Think Like a Man" becomes as tedious as "Valentine's Day," a movie based on a holiday, or "He's Just Not That Into You," a movie based on putdowns disguised as advice.__It wants only to entertain - and it succeeds.__[It's] smart, funny and impossibly good-looking.__Think Like A Man isn't the first movie based on a self-help book, but it may be the best.
________Despite the obviousness of its political points, the film has a scattershot, breezy appeal.__What these dog days of political campaigning needs is a good, sharp political satire. Alas, The Campaign is not that movie -- not even close.__Simply taken as a broad character comedy, "The Campaign" definitely has its moments.__It's way over the top, but then again, so are most modern political campaigns. Lots of funny s--- here.__[A] very raunchy and sometimes pretty funny comedy - which isn't above going for dumb jokes, but is also smart enough to play to its two stars' strengths.__This movie is single-handedly causing a major rise in our mirth deficit. It's so bad, I'm declaring a laugh emergency.__It's an average Will Ferrell comedy, nothing more.__This big, broad, laugh-out-loud farce isn't in the business of deep swipes or sharp insights. Its main message is that politics pretty much makes fun of itself.__The movie has political savvy as well as comedic chops.__Prefers silly, outre jokes and sight gags to a truly penetrating critique of partisan politics that has gone hopelessly off the rails.__Raucous in its send-ups of the moral, financial and sexual peccadilloes of the common political animal.__Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis trade barbs and sling mud, but the humor is inconsistent and the political satire lacks bite.__Maybe the surreal realities of the current campaign really are beyond satire, ridicule, parody or ready comprehension, but this ultimately puerile gagfest has little reach and less grasp.__Often brings the laughs, but the movie's ultimate timidity over possibly vexing viewers of any political stripe renders the whole project somewhat sterile.__This cynical and funny film hits more often than it misses.__It's like a sober, centrist, irrelevant op-ed column, but with bad words and belly laughs.
"The Expendables 2" is lazily satisfied with repeating the first movie's formula, shortcomings and grisly strengths alike, just as the first movie was content to slavishly, ploddingly cover the hits of the '80s.__Nice to know America's action stars, no matter how old they get, will never lack for gainful employment.__Does exactly what it's supposed to do - no more, no less.__The Expendables 2 makes a franchise out of a novelty item, and the nostalgic kick is gone: It's a reminder that most of those '80s actioners were xenophobic and dumb, that many of its stars had more muscle mass than charisma.__Yeah, yeah, I get it: "The Expendables 2" is a fun-loving throwback to the gloriously bad action films of the 1980s. Here's what I don't get: Why couldn't it be a throwback to the good ones?__At least it's efficiently and breezily forgettable. What's more, there are laughs too and here's the best part - one or two of them are actually intentional.__It's hard not to like a movie in which Bruce Willis' toupee-less CIA agent accuses Stallone's ragtag band of mercenaries of engaging in "male pattern badness.''__What gives "Expendables 2" its charm is the film's unabashed nostalgia for the genre's best B-movie moments.__The Expendables 2 is corny, barbaric and sometimes visually murky. But humor and self-deprecating macho charm make this male pattern badness crowd-pleasing fun.__The movie is excellent crap, fine junk, an exercise in campy movie nostalgia, and a demonstration of American supremacy in the field of nutty cosmetic enhancements for aging movie stars.__Pleasantly dumb fun if you watch it with the right mind-set.__The Expendables 2 is reasonably cathartic in a fall-down-go-boom way, and if the picture's self-conscious riffing becomes tiresome after a while ... it's still much wittier than its predecessor.__Does it all have to be so tedious?__I wanted to like this movie. Really. But this sequel doesn't wear down your resistance; it just wears you out.__Stallone is once more an amiable host. He even pulls off heroics despite having an ill-advised 'stache laying over his mouth, which nowadays looks like a squished octopus.__For better and worse, this ultra-violent follow-up gives the audience what it wants in full force.__[A] saggy, rickety and occasionally winded geriatric action thriller ...__They all take turns playing the clown - and for the most part, it's fun to watch them at it, even if the body count is distressingly high.__The screen practically stinks of Old Spice and sweat__Chuck Norris is also in this movie, although you should know that he gets roughly five minutes of screen time, half of those devoted to his telling of a Chuck Norris joke.
For those with a burning curiosity to know how The Lord of the Rings as directed by Michael Bay might look, Wrath of the Titans provides an idea.__What it lacks are the very elements that made the first movie such a surprise: wit and nerve.__This feeble followup to 2010's godawful Clash of the Titans sucketh the mighty big one.__Worthington remains a distinctly humourless hero, which makes you long for the likes of a prime-time Harrison Ford or Arnold Schwarzenegger, who knew how to make a fondue out of cheese.__The father of the gods turned out to be a CGI-created, lava-spewing, mountain-sized creature with smudgy features and all the eloquence of a belch.__A movie in which whole sequences consist of nothing but guys fighting stiff computer images. Such scenes would be boring even were they done well, but these scenes aren't done well.__At least it doesn't take itself too seriously.__This big-budget production will probably look terrific in IMAX, but what you'll mostly see in "Wrath" is the spectacle of Hollywood spending money in all the wrong places.__The good news is: "Wrath" is a much better film than "Clash" - lighter, more agile, with much better special effects and pretty decent 3-D.__A journey back to an ancient time when gods walked the earth, monsters breathed fire and stout-hearted warriors wore adorable leather cheerleader skirts with strappy gladiator sandals.__Doesn't drag in doling out familiar sensations.__Maybe it's just my imagination, but Sam Worthington seems to be getting slightly less stiff as an actor. He now smiles occasionally, and he's at least risen to the soulful inexpressiveness of the young Ryan O'Neal.__Countless boring sword-and-sandal skirmishes, none of which feel remotely suspenseful, until the hugeness of it all becomes a mildly passable joke.__While the special effects are sharper than in Clash of the Titans, the dialogue is equally uninspired.__Wrath radiates the straight-forward, straight-faced pleasures of the mytho-muscular epics, like Hercules and Jason and the Argonauts, produced in Europe a half-century ago.__[A] loud and agonizingly dull sequel that inherits all the problems that plagued its predecessor - and then some.__This is pure product, a movie desperately without energy or enthusiasm of any kind.__When the Titans last clashed two years ago, their dialogue was idiotic, their plot machinations impenetrable and their 3-D process an add-on disaster. The best I can say for this sequel-not such a bad best-is that you'll want to keep your 3-D glasses on.__Though the film shortchanges us on the promise of its title, providing only one titan, it is overkill in most other regards.__Rarely has a film so equally balanced macho and nacho...
There is a dogged leanness to Reacher's pursuit that lifts his adventures from the generic rut ...__If Cruise's fantasy superhero garners as many staunch fans ... we may be witnessing the birth of a new franchise.__Jack Reacher already feels as if it belongs to another era.__A clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie that offers little more than every other clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie.__A workmanlike action thriller, competent but never particularly thrilling.__Jack Reacher is an absurdly self-confident, sociopathically laser-focused detective-bot. That is to say, he's a hero that only Tom Cruise could love.__The dialogue is often unintentionally funny and Cruise's performance is all wrong.__This movie is a turkey gone rancid.__Werner Herzog, better known as one of the finest living directors, plays a bad guy with Teutonic relish. If he doesn't watch it, he'll have a whole other career for himself playing dead-eyed villains.__This is brisk, attention-grabbing, and generally unpretentious -- basically an old noir programmer inflated to blockbuster proportions.__It only ends up reminding us of how much better Cruise's riskier, more personal work - particularly his outside-the-box performances in pictures like "Tropic Thunder," "Magnolia" and "Rock of Ages" - truly is.__Reacher is limited by a lack of originality and hampered by thematic cliches and generic action sequences.__Cruise is too mature, diminutive and fine-looking for the role, even if he has gym-sculpted abs, which he manages to show off.__See Tom fight. See Tom shoot. See Tom in some other movie.__It's touching beyond measure to see an ex-jarhead and a former soldier putting aside their differences in a display of mutual respect, understanding and shooting bad guys in the face.__A wildly ill-advised miscalculation, with Cruise's virtually unstoppable appeal butting uncomfortably against Reacher's alternately cocky and downright crude cynicism.__An average action film, made slightly better by Cruise, and more bizarre by Herzog, and more watchable by Pike, but still within the average range, a silk purse that still says oink.__No worse and maybe a little better than most of the vigilante movies that clutter the multiplex.__As the details mount, and the star does what stars do, it starts to seem like a good bag of potato chips. There's no nutritional value, but darned if you don't keep eating.__The picture is joyless and perfunctory. Call it Mission: Possible.
The only reason to see Dark Shadows is to discover how dire and pointless-how flat-out dreadful-a movie can be even when it has Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Helena Bonham Carter attached to its flimsy pretext.__This is not so much a coherent movie as it is a long, expensive joke in search of a purpose.__Mostly Dark Shadows is silly when we're trained to expect slightly richer fun from Burton and Depp.__Fans of Depp's past collusions with Burton will find their rewards along the way. But there's a perfunctory vibe to the goings on, a weariness amid the weirdness.__Clearly, they made the movie they wanted to make. It's just not the movie this "Dark Shadows" fan hoped to see.__Dark Shadows' only meaningful relationship is between Depp and his audience. He's a persona now, no longer an actor.__How bad is "Dark Shadows"? It makes you long for a "Twilight" movie. That's bad.__"Dark Shadows'' certainly has its moments, especially when Barnabas and Angelique hilariously wreck her office during a surreal, CGI-fueled, PG-rated tryst.__At once a brash, strutting pop culture pastiche and gloomy exercise in self-cannibalizing nostalgia, "Dark Shadows" is depressing on myriad levels.__Can't decide whether it's a parody, a horror comedy, an atmospheric melodrama, or a tedious bucket of crap. Eventually it chooses the last one.__When you consider all the pitfalls avoided, and all the laughs and pleasures it provides along the way, "Dark Shadows" is a satisfying and skillful effort.__Burton's offbeat montages are amusing, but the story's slow start and overblown conclusion make Dark Shadows half a good movie.__Burton's offbeat montages are amusing, but the story's slow start and overblown conclusion make Dark Shadows half a good movie.__An uncertain combination of elements that unsuccessfully tries to be half-scary, half-funny and all strange...__"Dark Shadows" is amusing, in fits and spurts, and sure to make tons of money, but terribly familiar and fatigued.__[Burton] and Depp, both avowed childhood fans of the original series, seem to be in their element and having a grand old time.__Handsome, vaguely true to the old soap opera, and inert.__"Dark Shadows" opens promisingly, downshifts after 30 minutes, and sputters into a meandering, momentum-free mess.__The script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witless and meandering - and I wouldn't mind the witless so much if it moved, or the meandering if it were droll.__The film's biggest disappointment is the utter lack of chemistry between Depp and either Green or Heathcote.
This grating family comedy resembles a sitcom in its flat lighting, patronizing music cues, and frames supplying little visual information apart from the actors' mugging faces.__One of those intergenerational embarrassment comedies in the Meet the Fockers line, where children can enjoy seeing grown-ups looking ridiculous.__An extended "in my day" joke intended to convey the superiority of old people over a lot of supposedly contemporary behavior that doesn't actually exist in real life.__After a while it seems to run out of jokes, maybe to make room for all the crying and hug-it-out family redemption in the last half hour.__I can't deny I did feel fonder of my own family afterward, mostly because I know none of them would ever make me sit through Parental Guidance.__It's hard to know who exactly "Parental Guidance" was made for.__It's a shame they didn't choose a stronger project than Andy Fickman's family comedy, but you could certainly ask for worse babysitters.__Thanks to Crystal and Midler playing comfortable versions of the personas we've come to know, it's actually better than you would guess.__Does it work? You betcha. There are smiles and tears, love and affirmations, a few funny jokes and a lot of easy sentimentality.__Deeply, willfully out of touch ...__From a bounty of low, low moments in "Parental Guidance," it's difficult to choose the absolute lowest.__Director Andy Fickman opts against subtlety at every turn. A score filled with heavy strings and the occasional ringing of chimes telegraphs all emotional cues, practically willing the water out of your tear ducts.__Parental Guidance is an engaging comedy that bridges multiple generation gaps, making it that rare movie that grandparents, their kids, and their kids can enjoy.__Say what you will about The Guilt Trip, another pairing of a nebbishy comic and a diva of a certain age, that movie at least offers two recognizable human beings of different generations meeting in the middle and learning something from each other.__If you're looking for an all-ages crowd-pleaser, this may be your best bet.__This kernel of inter-generational farce never pops.__Parental Guidance kicks off with a mean-spirited joke about an overweight woman and heads downhill from there.__Parental Guidance should be rated X - suitable for no one.__The laughs just aren't there.__[It] might as well be called AARP Presents: Billy Crystal Is Old, And What's Going On With All The Facebooking And Twittering And iPods?
A mess.__The most indelible performance in the film is not, strictly speaking, a performance at all. Rather it is Woola, a six-legged Martian hound who rather resembles a cross between a bulldog and a fetal gila monster.__The reported $250 million price tag for John Carter gives one pause. I suppose one could argue that masterpieces have no price. Then again, John Carter is no masterpiece.__Where John Carter continually gets it right is pacing, levity, and breadth of story.__Whenever the fighting stops and two people have to stand and talk, all the air goes out of everything. Suddenly it feels as if we're in an empty theater, watching a dusty old sword-and-sandal epic.__It isn't bad so much as innocuous, $250-million worth of innocuous, framed by a decent start and a solid finish but sagging through the long middle like a cheap mattress.__Though messy and overlong, it's an enjoyable throwback to the movie spectacles of a more innocent age.__"John Carter" is a huge bore.__Gets off to such an incoherent start that it takes almost the entire, interminable two-hour-plus running time to catch up.__Suffers from a convoluted plot and an anticlimactic resolution, but hits enough high notes along the way to be enjoyable.__The villains are overwrought and the design of Mars is surprisingly bland.__This middle section, in which both Carter and the audience get a crash course in the politics, history, and theology of the Red Planet, is the movie at its most imaginative and most fun.__There's nothing to see, nothing to think about, nothing to care about, and nothing to feel, just emptiness. The emptiness is never filled over the course of 132 long, barren minutes.__Messy and chaotic ... but also colorful and kind of fun.__A deadly heaviness brings Disney's would-be epic down.__It starts with a great story - of love and politics, time travel and mystical pathways between planets - badly sucked dry.__All of these characters, and the richly detailed backdrops, are utterly immersive and lifelike - even without the completely unnecessary 3-D.__It's hard to believe Pixar's founder would have signed off on this project. The film is as overcomplicated, bloated and crash-prone as a bad-old-days Microsoft release.__There's something generic about the digitally rendered Martians (whatever their stripe and skin tone), and there's a corniness to the dialogue that keeps the audience from any kind of emotional attachment to the Tharks and Zodangans and their ilk.__Against the odds, "John Carter'' is itself pretty amazing - an epic pulp saga that slowly rises to the level of its best imitations and wins you over by degrees.
'Act of Valor' reeks of military-sanctioned exploitation drama aimed solely at the 'Call of Duty' set.__Fighting is a learned skill; so is acting. And the SEAL stars are plausible only when on maneuvers - performing as their own stunt doubles.__When the bullets are flying, Act of Valor is undeniably tense and thrilling.__I don't know what to make of Act of Valor. It's like reviewing a recruiting poster.__The special ops missions are pretty amazing, but the SEALS as dramatic characters are under-developed.__One wonders how the movie might have played as pure, unceasing battle scenes, allowing the combat to define the characters; with real soldiers doing the onscreen fighting, something special may well have emerged.__Like all advertisements, this scripted movie is a perfect fantasy: expertly coordinated, simplistic (the bad guys like yachts and bikini girls while our heroes have loving families) and more than a little scary.__The bad guys, who specialize in funny beards, funny accents, and shaved heads, would feel right at home in an Austin Powers movie.__As a piece of filmed entertainment, "Act of Valor" will never be mistaken for "Top Gun," but it's a heck of a recruitment video.__These guys ... are the real deal. And any hero worship given them - badly done or not - is still deserved.__A mechanically efficient yet soulless dramatization of the U.S. Navy SEALs in action.__For action fans, the film delivers action. Beyond that, not so much.__Although the Seals continue in fine form, the co-directors seem fatigued from the journey, allowing their once-clean style to degenerate into a typical mishmash of clutter and bombast.__While subtleties and pacing are MIA, the filmmakers know how to shoot action and they make the most of it in Act of Valor.__The movie doesn't pretend to be anything but propaganda, a modern-day cousin to the morale-boosting documentaries made by John Huston and Frank Capra during World War II.__Refreshing as it is to see the military portrayed as something other than a band of neurotics and creeps, there's a reason this brand of rah-rah and bang-bang didn't outlast the age of Whitesnake and Marty McFly.__The exercises are genuine, and so is the hardware. But the script undermines the sense of authenticity at every turn.__Just barely a movie, "Act of Valor" is more like a high-quality recruitment video with interstitial acting.__Employing Navy troops as stars is a clever idea for an action thriller. But the soldiers' awkward line readings are glaring enough to distract from the potency of the story.__The filmmakers are so intent on shooting the real SEAL deal that they forget this is supposed to be a movie: We need a story.
However irritating 'This Is 40' is at times, there's a warmth that wins you over, and an honesty about families.____Apparently Apatow's penchant for if-it's-not-broke filmmaking isn't changing anytime soon. And it's a shame, because while This is 40 has plenty of laughs, it lacks decency and heart.__The performers are so likable that you stay with them even when, as is often the case, the material is hit-or-miss.__Judd Apatow is not a disciplined artist. And that's a good thing.__"This Is 40" tends to be about the self-inflicted problems of spoiled upper-middle class white people. Which can be sort of funny, sure. Sort of.__No one could be as whiny, spoiled, tasteless, combative and reliant on annoying stand-up comedy riffs as the entire cast of this film, the most disappointing one of the year.__Overlong, unnecessarily sex-obsessed and downright nasty at times, "This Is 40" feels haphazard and unfinished, despite a few moments of laugh-out-loud humor.__At times "This is 40" is brutally funny and brutally honest. Just as often, it's painfully shrill and unpleasant.__The film has as much to say about family dynamics as a couple's wavering love.__The real problem with "This Is 40" is its lack of truth, that Apatow wanted to express something about married life, and it eluded him.__There are moments of perception and sweetness, as per usual with Apatow movies. It's just too bad the movie's trajectory is formless and jokes built around petty marital resentments sometimes fall flat.__It's not so much a movie as a loose collection of mostly funny conversations; and maybe, for the holidays, laughter is almost gift enough.__With This Is 40, Apatow turns his audience into fitfully chuckling therapists, dealing with a raft of problems that aren't entirely sorted out.__The bawdy wit and crisp dialogue that were the hallmark of Apatow's Knocked Up are still present, but the conflicts feel so cushy that one gets the impression that the filmmaker is losing touch with life as it is lived outside of Brentwood.__There's a funny movie scratching at the edges of "This is 40."__"This Is 40" is a bull's-eye zeitgeist comedy, a movie in which everyone acts like real people but funnier.__This Is 40 is messy. But see it for its honest insights, its laughs, and for the terror Mann's character, as a mom defending her emotionally wounded daughter, rains down on a toothy school kid who's been sending unflattering texts.__There are a lot of loose ends and a few forced conclusions. But, then again, the acceptance of imperfection is Mr. Apatow's theme, so a degree of sloppiness is to be expected. That's life.__This is too much like a $35-million smart phone filled with kids' pictures.
The result is unlikely to linger long in the memory, but it's enormous fun while it lasts...__A winter-season product, but perfectly absorbing once it gets going.__It's a good, chugging caper movie for the most part.__Wahlberg could sleepwalk through this role, and does. See this movie and you'll surely follow his lead.__"Contraband" comes off the factory floor with its engine running and ready to drive. But the ride feels overly familiar.__Frankly, Wahlberg has outgrown movies like this. And so have we.__Everyone needs a little action now and then, right? Unfortunately, a little action is all you'll get.__Though it never quite has us by the lapels, the film is a solid, workmanlike action flick.__This very gritty bit of greased action does a decent job of shaking the sluggish out of January.__"Contraband" is like an "Ocean's Eleven" movie, minus the glamour.__"Contraband" aims to be dumb fun but gets only the first half right.__In order to pay it forward, Wahlberg needs to direct it somewhere else, and on and on, until every country has a version of this thing.__Contraband has a few moments of tension, but it adheres to a predictable heist formula hardly worth trafficking in.__If you enjoy watching Mark Wahlberg do that action-movie thing he does, you could do worse than to spend your next plane ride watching Contraband.__Whether he's slowing down time or ignoring its rules altogether, Mr. Kormakur's eccentric pacing brings its own dividends, as does what really gets him going in the film.__It's a so-so heist actioner with some serviceable thrills and better-than-average stunt work that hangs on a formula plot punctuated with fits of disturbing violence aimed at women.__Contraband is a film to be remembered, vaguely.__And then there's the predictability of the "surprise" villain; I won't spoil it here, but if you don't guess who it is well before the reveal, then I sincerely hope you enjoyed seeing your very first movie.__This is an uncommonly well-crafted action adventure, or an action misadventure, given how much goes wrong for the resourceful hero.__It's like an exciting police procedural turned on its head.
I found myself dreaming of the days when Willis would take a rest from Die Hard-ing to do character cameos of unexpected depth and pathos: Pulp Fiction, Nobody's Fool, and a few others. Now he clings to stoic longevity, and shoots people.__Yes, it's a B movie sci-fi thriller, but not many prestige pictures have this much going on underneath the surface.__That first hour cooks. And the second hour brings Emily Blunt into the story, which is a fine thing for any second half to offer.__If the whole thing leaves you rubbing your temples, just a bit... well, this headache's sort of worth it.__The reasoning behind all this may not reward prolonged inspection, but Johnson is smart enough to press onward with his plot, leaving us with neither the time nor the desire to linger over the logic ...__Writer-director Rian Johnson establishes himself as an original talent who clearly believes storytelling must prevail.__A mind-bending ride that is not afraid to slow down now and again, to explore themes of regret and redemption, solitude and sacrifice, love and loss. It's a movie worth seeing and, perhaps, going back to see again.__Looper has more heart than Brick and the 2008 con-man flick The Brothers Bloom. Both fine achievements, they could also be described as viscerally cerebral.__I'm a sucker for time-travel movies.__Looper felt to me like a maddening near-miss ...__It's a head flip of a time trip.__This is an exciting, exceptionally well-made futuristic thriller that also happens to be loaded with lived-in touches and punchy ideas.__Johnson doesn't explain too much, but he explains just enough about how two people can be one person, and how the younger entity's actions, in real time, can affect the memory of the older entity.__[It] may begin as a "Terminator"-like piece of time travel escapism, but ultimately gathers Old Testament-worthy force and fury.__An indie-inflected popcorn movie with major brains, brilliant acting and a highly satisfying payoff, "Looper'' is the first must-see movie of the season.__"Looper" looks like and is a blast; what's really cool is it's even more than that.__Johnson's action scenes occasionally stumble, but the devilishly clever script makes "Looper" a thrilling, dizzying ride.__The dialogue is as clever as the conceit.__While "Looper" lacks the heft of a classic, this wayback machine is worth taking for a spin.__This is a genuinely tough-minded and unpredictable movie, one of the fall's most enjoyable entertainments ...
Once the special effects take over, Berg has little room to assert his personality (or tell a story, for that matter), and the movie feels like a chore.__Battleship is substantially less awful than it could have been. And for me, that may have been the biggest disappointment of all.__If the movie is anything like the game, I say stay at home and read a good book (or graphic novel). Or listen to an audiobook - In short, do anything else.__Big loud stupid dopey shameless cliched overbearing and did I mention stupid?__One can be sure that heroic characters get what they want, bond with enemies, and earn respect.__"Battleship" doesn't sink, really. It just sits there booming endlessly as you look on aghast.__It makes "Top Gun" look like the work of Orson Welles. At least the Tom Cruise movie remembered to cast actual actors.__"Battleship" is an invigorating blast of cinematic adrenaline.__It's loud, it's large, it's stupid, and its best gag involves a chicken burrito.__Something of an earnest, two-hour infomercial that should do wonders for naval recruiting if not civilian entertainment.__This is the kind of summer movie that softens your brain tissue without even providing the endocrine burst of pleasure that would make it all worthwhile.__Mostly, Battleship is a noisy, overlong and numbing military-vs.-aliens saga with laughably bad dialogue.__Battleship is dopey, preposterous and unintentionally hilarious in all the wrong places, but as directed by Peter Berg, it is also energetic, fast-moving and bracing.__Like "Transformers," which it rivals in relentlessness, "Battleship" comes with its own force field, a furious energy that renders criticism irrelevant.__Well, it has aliens, for one thing.__Battleship is all noise and crashing metal, sinking to the shallows of Michael Bay's Armageddon and then digging to the brain-extinction level of the Transformers trilogy.__Hey, if you're Hasbro and Universal, and you've agreed to make a movie based on nothing more than brand recognition of a game, you've got to fill two hours with something.__[It] has a plot as unambitious as a macaroni dinner, familiar and easy to eat and not particularly nutritious.__The film boasts a destroyer's wallop of visual effects, but not enough brains to fill a dinghy.__I was never bored. And that, sadly, makes it better than most of the other expensive and over-hyped films of its ilk.
'30 Rock' and 'New Girl' writer Kay Cannon has created brilliant characters.__The girls, for the most part, are genuinely funny, weird, real, and, most excitingly, confident.__Warblers win the day in this sweet-natured film (based on a swell behind-the-scenes book by Mickey Rapkin) about the life and loves of collegians from competing a-cappella groups.__This is one of the strangest and also one of the more entertaining movies of the year.__Cannon doesn't go in for rococo hipster badinage in the vein of Diablo Cody. She can pare down a joke to its essence ...__What we have here is a not-very-funny college comedy for tweens, full of unappealing characters (and although the musical arrangements are fun, some truly unimaginative choreography).__Luckily, the good outweighs the bad in this bright 'n' breezy comedy about competitive a cappella singing groups.__If you're not grinning by the end of this light, funny crowd-pleaser, consider yourself tone deaf.__"Pitch Perfect" is major key all the way, a blast of tuneful sugary cheer kicked up with enough tart humor to offset the glucose.__Belatedly riffing on the TV series "Glee" might have produced some sour notes, but "Pitch Perfect" finds just the right tone.__"Pitch Perfect" totally gets one critical fact: A cappella singing contests are both a little bit amazing and a little bit ridiculous. The tone that the film strikes is a perfect balance between the two extremes.__A movie that's made to be obsessed over, seen 50 times, quoted as devoutly as such sacred texts as "Heathers" and "Bring It On."__"Pitch Perfect" doesn't take itself any more seriously than it has to, and has plenty of fun both sending up and celebrating its subject matter.__Though likable and energetic, the movie is so eager to put a finger on every pulse that it loses the rhythm.__A let's-put-on-a-show story so steeped in backlot Hollywood convention it almost embarrasses itself, with the difference being it really doesn't care.__The spirited a cappella singing in Pitch Perfect makes a predictable, feather-light coming-of-age film irresistibly fun.__Only occasionally funny and not at all illuminating about the rich world of a cappella singing.__What helps offset the predictable in this very predictable movie is a series of show-stopping numbers, so props to the folks who oversaw music and choreography. But the true saving grace is a few of the central players.__Not quite pitch perfect, but it's irresistible.__I got a goofball kick out of Pitch Perfect. Anna Kendrick is terrific in this spoofy, sassy romp. And I have one word for Rebel Wilson - Wow!
'Mirror Mirror' is as gaudily spectacular as you expect if you've seen director Tarsem Singh's films, 'The Fall' and 'Immortals'.__'Mirror, Mirror' is a trippy version of the Snow White story.__Mirror Mirror is a film that's all picture and no propulsion, each scene static in a basic set-decoration color scheme of teabag and banana.__Here, the familiar tale is retold with concessions to feminist self-determination and camp humor, bending the Grimm Brothers' tale without infringing on its basic beauty.__Singh is much more skilled as a visual artist than a storyteller, and his artistic fortunes seem to rise and fall with the inspiration of his screenwriters. In this case he's lucked out.__Who wants to see a fairy tale that weighs a ton? Mirror Mirror reflects badly on everyone involved.__Mirror Mirror is an odd little fantasia of a movie -- part jaunty adventure, part broad romantic comedy, part auteurist spectacle.__This rambling version of Snow White's tale is a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-coloured macarons and similarly devoid of substance.__The dwarves provide wonderful fun, Singh's visuals have true magic and Alan Menken's score is charming.__Part of Mirror's problem is that the screenplay, credited to two writers and with a third getting a story credit, is all over the place.__All we get are scattered bits of cleverness, some hit and some miss.__When the dust settles, all that's left are a few motes of lame comedy atop a few million bucks worth of overdressed sets. Call me Grumpy, but this seems less an adaptation than a random assault.__Loved it!__Everything looks, well, fantastic.__The screenwriters of this attempt to do a hip comedic take on the legend were licked by Page 5. Why did they keep going?__As Snow White, actress Lily Collins is a washout.__An attitude of mischief and charm rather than outright satire.__Singh brings cheeky humor, an eccentric sensibility and an enchanting look to his re-imagined tale.__Like all of Tarsem's films, story takes a backseat to visuals, and there's plenty to pop the eyes-love those life-size string-puppet assassins!-if not, ultimately, to stir the soul.__Even if you're as annoyed by the movie as I was, you'll come out laughing the costumes.
As pulp sci-fi this Fox release is pretty good, but it's also commendable for its sensitive depiction of adolescent behavior.__"Chronicle" is a mildly experimental commercial film, and, for the most part, it's loose-limbed fun.__Chronicle is the kind of movie that makes one excited about the future prospects of the man at the helm.__Without the found-footage distraction, Chronicle is an entertaining and creative take on the concept of teenage superpowers.__Although it dog-legs into silly mayhem in the homestretch, for a good portion of its quick 83-minute running time Chronicle is a quite clever boys-gone-wild-on-telekinetic-powers fantasy.__Chronicle puts a fresh, invigorating spin on the superhero origin story, a tale Hollywood spins again and again (and again).__Based on Chronicle, it's clear that Trank has the right stuff to move up to big-budget fantasy movies. If he wants to, that is. In a lot of ways, he has already beaten the studios at their game.__As a surprise entry in the mid-winter movie doldrums, "Chronicle" is a modest charmer.__Though Chronicle won't necessarily stick with you, it's a pleasant surprise in the doldrums of the winter film season.__"Chronicle" is an energetic hodgepodge that tweaks familiar conventions just enough to seem fresh. Forget the X-Men - these are iHeroes.__Once again, the conceit collapses along with the movie, and all that's left is third-act mayhem.__As yet another found-footage film, Chronicle makes a good argument against further use of this tired conceit.__With great power comes the responsibility to make a decent movie, but the mysterious force running through "Chronicle" is the power to supersuck.__A pretty good idea for a sci-fi thriller is undermined by hastiness - and by the pretense that it was mostly shot by one of its protagonists.__It's a testament to Trank's capable direction that the movie feels so grounded in reality. There is no sense of the magical in the goings-on, even though what the boys are doing defies logic and gravity.__[It] deconstructs the conventional superhero narrative and reassembles it as a canny discourse on impulse control and the troubled teen psyche.__Mr. Russell and Mr. Jordan are as likable as their characters, but it's Mr. DeHaan who pulls you uneasily in.__"Chronicle'' will never be mistaken for an artistic breakthrough, but it has a solid gimmick and pieces of it are brilliant.__The potent and provocative journey in Chronicle never stops springing surprises. You'll be hooked.__This mind-and-fork-bending sci-fi saga comes from the freaky imaginations of director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis, who've packed their feature debut with smartness.
Streep fans, I think you're going to enjoy this one. I know I did.__The film, a rehab job on a beached marriage, displays the most tender respect, the most exquisite tact, and yet it would be completely unwatchable -- an outright embarrassment -- with any other actors than Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep.__It's tough to come up with new superlatives for Meryl Streep, but the 63-year-old actress delivers her most frankly sexual performance yet in Hope Springs.__All that's missing are commercials for estrogen cream and erectile-dysfunction meds.__Streep is warm, and she's got the timing of a stand-up. Her performance demands you bat for her woman.__It's all a little depressing.__"Hope Springs" is a minor miracle of a movie.__It's something like Ingmar Bergman's "Scenes From a Marriage," as translated into the universe of the Lifetime Network.__A surprise that sneaks up and moves you, "Hope Springs" has the courage of its awkwardness, and this is said admiringly in the spirit of the film, which is irony-free and unfashionably earnest.__Somewhere along the line, what probably started out as a character study ended up as a wobbly drama that pushes some boundaries but eventually lets everyone off the emotional hook in favor of a smoothed-over happy ending.__What could have been strained farce or, worse, geezer porn, morphs instead into a film of hilarious and heartfelt pleasures. It helps that director David Frankel has two of the best actors on the planet to raise the game.__Yes, this is the fascinating stuff, a rare (in pop culture) look at the complex nature of the love-sex equation -- when it's too direct, when it's too vague, when it breaks down completely.__If the film doesn't really explore the pain and bitterness of this marriage, it's still leagues ahead of most such attempts.__These modest virtues are buried under such hard-sell devices as a manipulative muzak score and sitcom-style close-ups that disrupt the narrative momentum.__Director to Jones: "Just be yourself." Works for me. Master class in acting from the two leads.__Like a Hannah Montana movie, Hope Springs argues there are no romantic ills that a walk on the beach and a few pop songs on the soundtrack can't cure.__A genuinely sweet, perfectly acted, remarkably brave little movie that should make audiences swoon for something they thought was gone - a smart dramedy for grown-ups.__For mature audiences who have forgotten how to smile, it takes up where The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left off.__Hope Springs has the unusual distinction of providing a sample of what an Ingmar Bergman movie might be like if made for mass American consumption.__Hope Springs handles marriage and advanced-age sexuality with a refreshing, down-to-earth candor. In today's Hollywood, that counts as radical.
Once again, Beckinsale brings an impressive physicality and subzero cool to her portrayal of Selene.__Kate Beckinsale's "Selene" remains one-note, but it's a wildly entertaining note.__The combat quotient, to the movie's credit, is way up, with narrative folderol kept to a minimum.__The most generic entry of the bunch.__There's not much to this movie beyond a slick procession of dark, gleaming violence.__A brisk creature-feature that ditches the series' dreary mythology in favor of a more direct, action-oriented approach.__Beckinsale's Selene is back with a vengeance, that famous black catsuit and two fully cocked pistols, having wisely sat out the wretched third installment of the franchise. Don't expect much more than this.__The entire production is single-mindedly, earnestly devoted to serving up feats of BADASS, and it succeeds in this devotion to the exclusion of everything else.__[The] latest, dreadful entry in the vampires-battling-werewolves franchise.__Crude, cheap and pointless, this surely drives a stake through the heart of the 'Underworld' franchise.__Of all the movies whose makers designate them as crap by not screening them in advance for critics, forcing me to go to a multiplex in vampire hours and write a review in a sour overnight stupor, Underworld Awakening is one of the best.__Watching the film is strangely like looking at the same three still frames of supernatural battles over and over for 90 minutes.__More aggressively violent and thankfully less mythology-driven than previous installments, Underworld: Awakening is strictly for the converted.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Even taken as simple schmaltz, 'The Lucky One' lacks the romantic impact of the adaptation of Sparks's 'The Notebook' or even the Channing Tatum-starrer 'Dear John'.__As long as Efron's shirt comes off, he could play an accountant and no one in the target audience would care.__Well-acted schmaltz with some gaping plot holes.__There's not much to the movie besides handsome sets, sun-dappled photography and a plot as predictable as the verse in a Hallmark card.__[Hicks] hits the beats - lonely woman, hunky stranger - without bothering to develop even the slightest depth.__The overheated eroticism could have at least made for a camp classic, but the film's chilling narcissism ultimately makes for a pleasureless fantasy.__I'm beginning to think writer Nicholas Sparks isn't one person at all, but a roomful of ladies doing Harlequin-romance Mad Libs.__A sudsy romantic melodrama that in the 1950s would have been directed with lurid overkill by the likes of Douglas Sirk.__Another Nicholas Sparks novel, another cinematic brush with insulin shock.__A lazy (in all ways) Nicholas Sparks romance that's as pretty and vacant as its hero.__Logan's opening voice-over describes how fate can throw one's life off-course, but nothing about the film that follows strays from Sparks' well-established tear-jerking formula...__The Sparks-styled romance has almost become its own movie genre - predictable, pure of heart, sentimental and never straying from the boy-meets-girl basics, or the surface, for that matter - and in that "The Lucky One" delivers.__Unable as I am to locate any feelings about him, I see Mr. Efron as a hunk with a problem delivering sustained dialogue in units of more than one or two sentences.__The cliches are as thick as a vat of honey. And the love story proves just as syrupy.__The Lucky One doesn't have a genuine emotion in it or a plausible reason to endure it. It's strictly for the sisters of the cult of Sparks and the men who love them.__The latest screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance in which fate, destiny, and sage cliches whirl together in a sugar crash of meaningful moments and tasteful eroticism.__Seeing [Schilling] and Efron fumble at each other is like watching a stick of butter and a bag of flour not turn into a cake.__How can bestselling author Nicholas Sparks, the Thomas Kinkade of the paperback novel, keep churning out sluggish melodramas that lose not one ounce of sap on the trip to the big screen?__Despite a plot hole so big it could generate its own gravity field, it's still not a bad movie.__Efron acquits himself reasonably well. Is he sexy enough to make credible a scene where Beth seems to have an orgasm while washing dishes and watching him lift bags of dog food? Maybe not, but, honestly, who could?
The film has a vicious edge that the Marx Brothers didn't have, and it's too low-minded to achieve their enchanting blend of anarchy and surrealism.__Now [Cohen is] turning material both fresh and rancid into tepid gruel.__On the laughmeter The Dictator is closer to Borat than to the misfired Bruno, which is to say it's funny for about half of its brisk 83 minutes.__Most of The Dictator had me neither laughing nor shocked, but just staring at the screen in anxious is-that-all-there-is? silence.__A bit scattershot and schticky, the film never quite settles into a consistent comic rhythm. Yet for fans of Baron Cohen's work there are plenty of moments of crass hilarity.__For the most part, the movie's rhythms feel slightly off -- there are long stretches without a laugh -- and there is a mean-spirited air to the whole thing.__The Dictator starts at outrageous and rockets on from there. Screw the occasional sputter.__The Dictator is loose and slap-happy and full of sharp political barbs and has funny actors moving in and out - and at a lickety-split 83 minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome.__Sacha Baron Cohen's third starring feature, and the first to be fully scripted, is sharp as a scimitar in one scene and wobbly in the next, but it's unfailingly audacious.__For once, Baron Cohen has a real script and a supporting cast as skilled at improv as he is. And those complementary elements make a difference.__Directed by Cohen's longtime collaborator Larry Charles, The Dictator mixes its high and low comedy with surprising success.__It reasserts Baron Cohen as a comic force who can't be ignored, dedicated to pushing the envelope and working with real ideas.__It ends up being a lot less hilarious than "Borat,'' and not quite as funny as "Bruno.''__Although the character of Aladeen seems awfully predictable by Baron Cohen standards, the movie itself veers from one hilarious, absurd and patently offensive setup to the next...__Baron Cohen's demonstrations of political ''outrageousness'' feel all too canned, planned, and defanged.__While tastelessness is rampant and the humor uneven, The Dictator also has its moments of slyly clever satire.__By turns hysterical, heretical, guilty, innocent, silly, sophisticated, teasing and tedious.__Even in its manufactured boundary-pushing-a flash of full-frontal Baron Cohen, another scene set partially inside a birth canal-The Dictator never really risks anything.__This isn't the last word on cinematic send-ups of totalitarianism -- for that, we still have Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator -- but it's a fine and riotous jab in the ribs.__One of the cleverest moments in Sacha Baron Cohen's The Dictator comes during the first five seconds: a memorial dedication to Kim Jong Il. It's all downhill from there.
'Total Recall' is Hollywood at its worst: pointless, witless, and so very unnecessary.__"Total Recall" is a toned-down, smoothed-out version of an amped-up, bug-eyed classic.__This is a taut, serviceable sci-fi thriller with a couple of neat visual ideas, and if you're not familiar with either the Schwarzenegger version or the original story, the brain-bending twists alone will take you a reasonably long way.__Casting and visuals are an upgrade, but we get far too many action sequences and not enough of the mind games.__I was no particular fan of the first Total Recall, but I confess that this flat, by-the-numbers remake made me a tad nostalgic for its bombastic preposterousness.__Whatever tug Total Recall has on the imagination comes from the vague sense we've seen it all before. And seen it better: from Christopher Nolan's Inception to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.__Director Len Wiseman is good on action, and Patrick Tatopoulus's dystopic production design is within hailing distance of Blade Runner, his chief influence. But essentially this is a big-screen video game.__Where Paul Verhoeven's original was testosterone-stupid and, therefore, fun, Wiseman's film is just boring-stupid.__Farrell is confident and competent regardless of the situation; there never seems to be any real threat of him coming out alive.__Those who buy a ticket to Total Recall may not go in expecting a generic Bourne sequel, but that's about what they'll be getting - just set in a Blade Runner universe made of giant gray Lego blocks.__The effects look great, but is that even worth noting when smart high-schoolers can make monsters on their laptops? What movie's effects don't look great these days?__Today's Total Recall does nothing to tarnish the image of yesterday's - 22 years from now, I expect it to be hailed as a classic.__If you share its desire for straight adrenaline, the ride works.__I kept thinking: "Yes, that was surprising to me in 1990."__While it may not be a fully realized take on Dick's forward-thinking work, it's still a far better film than the Verhoeven version.__For all of its dazzlingly rendered cityscapes and nonstop action, this revamped "Total Recall" is a bland thing - bloodless, airless, humorless, featureless. With or without the triple-bosomed prostitute.__The fun is fun while it lasts, it just doesn't last long enough.__Soulless, bombastic and numbingly repetitive...__Wiseman directs his film as if it's a shark... But really, it's more of a carp, shiny and pretty but fat and dopey, fed on nothing but scavenged leftovers.__The remake has no grace notes, or grace, no nuance, no humanity, no character quirks, no surprises in the dialogue and no humor ...
Outside of porn, there has never been a movie with so many shots of grown men eyeing teenage girls' backsides. The result is fitfully amusing but more often just creepy.__American Reunion tries to use nudity, sex, and fecal matter to generate laughter, but the jokes are tired and predictable.__Yes, American Reunion is a juvenile outing. They steal jet skis and defecate in beer coolers. They cheat on their girlfriends and lie to their best friends. But what did you expect?__Rare is the movie that brings "American Pie" to mind and suffers by comparison, but here we have one.__None of it makes much of an impression, although there are a few nice and surprisingly heartfelt moments around the edges.__A strained, relentless quest for gross-out humor and outlandish sexual escapades.__Confirms the perception that only losers attend high-school reunions.__In the end, "American Reunion" even gets away with its sequel-baiting closing line: "Till next time!"__"Reunion" should be the last slice of "Pie," America.__Overall, the level of wit and invention from writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg is well below their scripts for the three "Harold and Kumar" movies.__An aggressively crass - and not especially funny - trip down memory lane, an attempt to recapture the sweetly ribald magic of the earlier film.__Doesn't provide the generational high producers thought it would; this isn't exactly the cast of "American Graffiti."__The entire film is a mistake.__It has some good moments, but it goes on too long, and not enough happens that is likely to create new memories.__American Reunion, remarkably, might just be the funniest issue yet from the American Pie franchise factory.__Bad enough that the film is smutty and that most of the female characters are either bores or bitches, but there are almost no laughs, save what Scott valiantly squeezes out of Stifler's antics.__It's kind of sad, in a way.__American Reunion reminds us what we liked about the original: the way the movie sweetened its raunch to build a rooting interest in these characters.__The movie's message is that the way to face impeding maturity is to embrace your inner teen idiot.__It's a reunion that finds the old friends grappling with new dilemmas.
Ghoulish? Yes. Funny? You bet.__Paranorman has a unique look that's equal parts old school and cutting edge.__The film avoids the pandering of many animated features, bringing an acerbic edge and a thrilling intelligence to its story.__"ParaNorman" took a huge risk on a scarier concept, and it paid off enormously.__"ParaNorman" is never less than entertaining, but you'll have to follow it into a strange purgatory between two opposing genres.__If the story lacks the consistent psychological depth of Coraline, another tale of an outcast finding solace in a parallel world, amends are made during the lovely climax.__Chances are most kids, and most adults, will find "Paranorman" perfectly horrible in the best possible way.__Employs stop-motion animation to provide hand-crafted appeal to the clever and surprisingly scary story of a Massachusetts town whose witch-hunting past catches up with it on its 300th anniversary.__A colorfully macabre stop-motion animation comedy that embraces the sociopolitical allegories of George A. Romero's zombie pictures and reworks them into a feature-length episode of "Scooby-Doo."__Humor depends on character, context and continuity, none of which is in abundant supply in "ParaNorman."__The world of Blithe Hollow exists in real space. The residents have real bags under their eyes, real bellies at their belt buckles. Ugliness alternates with rapturous beauty ...__It may be the most fun you'll have with ghosts and zombies all year.__An entertaining and visually attractive family-friendly story.__The story, an amusing if not especially fresh tale involving a witch and some Puritans, is principally a vehicle for the movie's meticulously detailed pictorial beauty, which turns each scene into an occasion for discovery and sometimes delight.__The spirit of great stop-motion animators like George Pal and Ray Harryhausen lives on in ParaNorman, and not just as a ghost: It's so real you could almost reach out and touch it.__"ParaNorman" has plenty of rambunctious thrills to give the kiddies goosebumps, while older connoisseurs of stop-motion animation will appreciate the Laika studio's inventive visuals.__The movie has its moments of dark whimsy and cheeky wit, but most of what it has is body parts.__It's not just Pixar that kicks ass in animation. There's magic in ParaNorman, a small miracle in stop-motion 3D from the wizards at Laika.__ParaNorman, blessed with otherworldly animation, can't escape the demons of story.__This swell stop-motion animation operates on a wavelength similar to that of Laika's debut feature, Coraline, with assured character comedy counterbalanced by a solemn sense of macabre wonder.
Yet another case of Hollywood execs trying way too hard to give the audience what they think it wants.__The director is McG, who allows no motion to pass without a musical energy boost.__"This Means War" is the worst McG film yet. And good Lord, that is saying something.__The best you can say about This Means War is that it would make a good date movie for couples in the witness protection program.__Slides by on the strength of Tom Hardy.__And we have our first lock for the Worst of the Year list.__Not even cutie-pie Oscar-winner Reese Witherspoon can hold our attention for long in this ridiculous, bombastic romance.__It's a date movie for suckers.__You can imagine how the ball got rolling on "This Means War.'' You can also imagine how the folks who rolled the ball started to lose their minds.__In the dictionary, "frothy" is defined as being "light and entertaining but of little substance." This Means War is a totally frothy film. And that's a good thing, at least here. (Sometimes substance is overrated.)__It's a bad sign when a film which aims only for froth can't achieve more than moments of embarrassment, punctuated with sporadic agitation.__Proves to be little more than the canned Spam of the movie world - bland, over-processed and cheap, even when it's spending millions engulfing highways in balls of ludicrous flame.__If you want some nice light yuks, "This Means War" should do the trick.__McG can't seem to decide whether he's making a spy action flick with romance interspersed or a rom-com peppered with action.__Would be perfectly acceptable watched on the back of an airline seat or at home while you're doing housework.__Reese Witherspoon isn't an idiot, and yet she made "This Means War," which leads to the question: Was this some temporary lapse in judgment or was this the best offer she had?__Note to Witherspoon: This Means War is the sort of consumer product you're supposed to test before you win an Academy Award, not after.__Hardy is raffishly charming. But you don't send a grenade to do a feather's job. Which is exactly the mistake that McG, director of this earsplitting, hyperbolic love triangle, makes.__A good parody takes a finesse that isn't in the vocabulary of McG, a bargain-basement Michael Bay more concerned with cool than coherence.__Technically, movies don't give off a scent, but This Means War is so smarmy that it seems to reek of cheap cologne.
This is a film desperately in need of a McLovin. Also, jokes would help. And comedic chemistry between the actors. And an ending that isn't a bolted-on cop-out. Save yourselves. It's too late for me.__The movie has all the heft of a tweet, but Philips has made it look pimp and, until the police end the party, Project X really is a riot.__Ultimately, Project X is an example of why gimmicks rarely work, especially once the new shine has worn off.__"Project X" bears a cravenly piggish attitude toward rewarding socially unacceptable behavior that feels unseemly rather than exciting, so-what rather than so-funny and obvious instead of new.__"There's a midget in the oven!" is about as inspired as the dialogue and set pieces get in this queasy-making entertainment about a 17-year-old dude's birthday bacchanalia.__The parent and homeowner in me were appalled by the debauchery and incredible property damage. The teenage boy in me couldn't help but smirk anyway.__With its cast of unfamiliar faces and catalog of underage wish-fulfillment fantasies, this game-changing instant classic will doubtless inspire imitators.__These kids apparently attend Actress-Model High School, where the guys run the gamut from hot to dorky, but practically every female is skinny, stacked and ready to flash their racks to apparently dozens of video cameras.__As party porn goes, "Project X" has its moments. In terms of drama, character or intelligence, it's pure bong water.__It's a perfectly lame movie that speaks intriguingly to the way we live now.__There is no way you could make this movie stupider or more pointlessly noisy than it already is.__A thin, painfully overlong comedy about an out-of-control party thrown by a trio of high-school losers.__Halfway through this movie I thought I was giving it an F, but then...__Pasadena, in case you were wondering, is where the meaning of the word "epic" goes to die.__[It] feeds I Love the '80s cliches through a kind of bobbing-camera Mixmaster. It's Can't Hardly Wait for the age of Jersey Shore.__The "Animal House" of the iPhone generation? Could be. Pretty enjoyable for parents too.__An unapologetic and breathlessly amoral cinematic debauch about a California high school kid whose parents leave town and who throws an out-of-control, alcohol-soaked, drug-fueled, sex-crazed, jiggling-naked-breast-filled suburban bacchanal.__[It] would be every parent's worst nightmare if it weren't so inane.__The movie is ugly in both its look and outlook. It aims for the bottom and hits the bulls-eye.__Have teenagers always been this idiotic or does Project X move the goalposts?
The moody, beautifully composed production raises it above the norm.__It takes quite a time before the pieces of a poisonous puzzle appear, and when they do, they don't always fall into place with clarity.__'The Woman in Black' is old-fashioned, ornate, imposing, occasionally creaky - and possessed of more than a few enjoyably nasty surprises.__The star's job description is that he be able to react convincingly to a variety of supernatural events and to endure being covered in mud. He has difficulty with neither.__Haunted house movies basically live and die by their atmospherics and by the consequences to those poor mortals who come too close to the premises, and The Woman in Black delivers on both counts.__The Woman in Black is your standard-issue ghost story, gussied up in period garb to make it look like a prestige picture.__None of it's new, but it's fun particularly because - like those Hammer films of yore - it peoples its great sets with solid actors.__A hoot of an old-fashioned British horror film in which being under 10 years old is not a good thing.__There's little that's new, revealing or stylish about this basic-black horror story, but if you've got a Goth sensibility, it might suit you.__A disappointing post-Potter debut from Radcliffe, barely breathing in this musty, creaky chiller.__Though Radcliffe occasionally seems too stiffly callow to be completely convincing in this grown-up role, the movie is a proficient thriller with a potential appeal beyond the star's fan-girl audience.__A creaky haunted-house story that's strong on creepy atmosphere but woefully deficient in the scare department.__Watkins knows how to make a body jump out of its skin, even if he does use the face-reflected-in-the-mirror/window trick once too often. At the same time, the film is kind of, well, silly.__If this is what disposable modern horror is going to look like, I'll take the classical frights of The Woman in Black  over the herky-jerky hokum of The Devil Inside any day.__The Woman in Black is a tasteful, old-school frightener, emphasizing suspense and foreboding over blood and guts.__The frights don't exceed PG-13, and the color never brightens much past gray.__This is an effective genre exercise, if not an especially inspired one.__If the story is laid out none too subtly, its straightforward purity is, finally, its greatest strength.__A skillful haunted-house film that will soon evaporate from your memory like the ghostly specter of its title.__The director uses time-honored techniques to keep you on edge, every one of which graced Hammer films of yore. But happily for the picture, there's a reason they're time-honored.
We're still seeing things through handheld devices and built-in laptop cameras, even though nobody seems interested in looking at the footage the cameras were supposedly recording.__Even for a something about supernatural shenanigans, this ending is embarrassing.__They could have called this Paranormal Inactivity.__The mood is often playful, with teases and fake-outs that are sometimes humorous and usually right before shocks. Violence is rare, quick and devoid of lingering close-ups.__There are at least a half-dozen or so decent jolts to be enjoyed over the film's running time, but prepare for a long wait to actually get to them.__The mythology has deepened, largely to the negative, and the formula is as rigid as the fixins of a fast-food sandwich-tastes the same in every city. But the effects are eternally reliable.__Screenwriter Christopher Landon, along with co-directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, make a truly lame attempt at establishing a supernatural mythology to explain all this ...__It's all faint-by-numbers this time, without even a cool device like the low-tech fan cam from PA3 to interest us or really scare us.__There is still activity, I regret to report, and none of it is of the normal variety.__The scares are hit-and-miss, but at least Alex and Ben are fun to hang out with.__Mostly, it plays like a overlong prologue for the already-in-the-works PA5. Here's hoping this is just the tension-racking lull before the next big scream.__The franchise that capitalized on the found-footage craze has gotten lost.__This film's strong suit is that it finally feels contemporary.__Of course, a promise of more activity to come. But unless moviegoers think it's worth watching another whole cast of characters sleep while their furniture moves around them, only diehard fans will stay awake for that next entry.__There's a point at which movies become only merchandise, and the Paranormal franchise may be heading for that nexus, that nadir.__There's nothing very new to the shocks. (Even the sound of them is the same.)__This once-innovative series rolls on without much regard for either plot or character development.__Less reliant on slow-burn suspense and larded with fake-out jump scares, this is the first sequel in the series that fails to advance the overall mythology in any meaningful way.__None__None
__From the amateur acting, writing and directing to an ending that is shocking only in its stupidity, The Devil Inside will make you puke for all the wrong reasons.__It stumbles along to what may arguably be the most abrupt, nonsensical ending since Luis Bunuel stopped slicing cows' eyes for the sake of surrealism.__"The Devil Inside'' usefully reminds us how little it takes to make some people scream in a crowded movie theater.__The Devil Inside's biggest shock arrives when it abruptly ends - just as it hits its stride.__People of the world: If you find some footage, leave it be. You will likely be doing the rest of us a huge favor.__Whatever possessed Bell & Co. to turn a slow-burning creepfest into a frenzied freak show of multiple exorcisms (including one in a moving car), the devil only knows.__You can see where this is going, and the filmmakers can see that you can see. So they rush to the hideous yet hilarious climax in little more than an hour and then pad the running time with the slowest-moving credits ever.__While it doesn't exactly reinvent the inverted cross, The Devil Inside definitely puts a nifty indie spin on the demonic possession genre.__Clearly, when a cheapie pickup like "Paranormal Activity," which Paramount released a few years ago, turns into franchise gold, there's just no stopping the banality.__The Catholic Church was wise to want nothing to do with The Devil Inside. Everyone else should follow suit.__Bell directs with all the enthusiasm of a guy who was called into work on his day off.__Director William Brent Bell (Stay Alive) and his co-writer Matthew Peterman offer way too much set-up for too little payoff.__Proves as scary and unsettling as a slab of devil's food cake - only considerably less satisfying.__The Devil Inside joins a long, woozy-camera parade of found-footage scare pictures, among them The Blair Witch Project, the Paranormal Activity films and certain wedding videos that won't go away.__It's better when you don't show too much - but if your story is about the supernatural, eventually you're going to have to come up with something. "The Devil Inside" can't.__Here it is just the first week of January, and already we have a strong candidate for the worst movie of 2012.__Despite the palpable air of deja vu that hangs over it like a light fog, The Devil Inside generates a fair amount of suspense during sizable swaths of its familiar but serviceable exorcism-centric scenario.__None__None
Odd indeed.__The film is schmaltzy and very saccharine, so sweet it'll give you a toothache.__It's hard to believe that Hedges once wrote some decent light fiction (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, An Ocean in Iowa) before he started making greeting-card movies like Dan in Real Life and this one.__"There comes a point where "Odd Life of Timothy Green" is just too sentimental and too odd."__A fable about parenting and its accompanying joys and sorrows, done in the trademark Walt Disney style of pleasant, feel-good entertainment that doesn't leave much of an emotional trace.__Mostly, The Odd Life of Timothy Green feels contrived , if undeniably sweet.__[It] feels like a retreat - into manufactured drama shellacked with sticky sentimentality, into risk-free storytelling full of coldly contrived conflict.__It's the sort of thing you'll either find enchanting or an excellent reason to reach for the Scotch.__Anyone with an expectation of reality, or an aversion to mawkish melodrama, should probably stay home.__Hedges is a determined romantic and a bit of a saphead. He's also humane.__"The Odd Life of Timothy Green" is the sort of movie you actually hope kids see. How rare is that?__[It] invites critical derision, and Mom always taught me it was rude to refuse an invitation.__Someday we should hold a contest to see who's better at smiling through tears: Robin Williams or Jennifer Garner.__Not only is the story dreamed up by producer Ahmet Zappa even odder than the title indicates, its execution gets increasingly irritating as the film goes on.__A sun-dappled, heartwarming family film about a 10-year-old who sprouts out of the garden one magic night. It stars an extraordinary boy, C.J. Adams, with an extraordinary pair of gray eyes that gleam with joy and insight.__The movie should have been called Diary of a Wimpy Forrest Gump.__A pleasant if occasionally humdrum fairy tale, "The Odd Life of Timothy Green" lets us spend two hours in the company of some very nice people.__The ghastliness of this damp and squishy comedy is the byproduct of a confused and earnest sentimentality, a willful devotion to wide-eyed wonder that confuses simplicity with simple-mindedness.__It is sweet but tries to avoid sentimentality, at least for as long as it can. And the casting of CJ Adams as the title character goes a long way toward forgiving the lapses.__"The Odd Life of Timothy Green" is Disney's formula flawlessly executed.
This is a boring movie. The over-the-top outlandishness can't disguise that the whole 95 minutes represent one big snooze-fest.__Whether Cage is still paying off castles, appeasing the IRS, or rebuilding his comic book collection, it's clear he's decided, for now, to trade his talent for cold, hard cash.__Spirit of Vengeance is weighted down for long stretches in the middle, as it starts to treat its own religious hokum plotline with undue seriousness.__Shot in Romania and Turkey, the scenery is terrific and gives you something to watch other than this confusing mess. Johnny Blaze, you're just a candle in the wind, mate.__The film, though, has some redeeming qualities, including the presence of Idris Elba as the obligatory good guy, who encourages Johnny to get Danny into the protective custody of a religious order.__That mix of admirable restraint and unabashed pandering makes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance a guilty pleasure, if not the most wholesome treat.__Like the first Ghost Rider movie, this one burns plenty of rubber trying to swerve around plot holes and thinly written characters.__The bad news is that this sequel, which wants to wow us with its unrestrained, hyper-stylized, WTF-ness, is way too disposable for its own good.__At best, the Neveldine/Taylor team is capable of transforming ingeniously trashy premises into pop art, but here, they inherit a promisingly trashy franchise and fail to give it the allure and go-for-broke energy of superior trash.__Like a laboratory experiment on how often a movie can spin from bad to good and back again.__This is a movie about a flaming skeleton that rides a motorcycle -- there's no excuse for it to be this dull.__Ordinarily I'd be into the idea of seeing Nicolas Cage's face burn, but alas, "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance" is not a documentary.__The standards of all involved are so obviously floorboard-high, there's not much to say after the lights come up other than one of Blaze's "one-liners": "So, that happened."__One look at the dreadful mess that is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance will turn your whisper into a primal Cage scream: MAKE THIS MOVIE STOP!__What more would one want? Well, actually, quite a bit, but this movie ain't got much more than that. Still, as noisesome entertainments go, it 'brings' that thing we sometimes call 'it.'__Supernatural fantasy movies often work best when the film-maker's tongue is planted firmly in the cheek.__An aggressively mediocre improvement on the first film.__Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure hero's mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there.__None__None
The Grey remains a genuinely gripping survival story and a refreshing change from stale urban action flicks.__The Grey is about raging against the dying of the light but also about accepting it with peace once the fight has been lost.__Three-fifths of a solid film!__The Grey, despite moments of sublimity, is as predictable as a funeral. When Ottway angrily calls out to God, the nonanswer is sadly redundant.__Somewhere along the line, apparently, it was decided that having men fight for their lives is not enough to hang a movie on. It has to be a movie about Big Ideas.__Hold on tight. It's a true call of the wild.__"The Grey" may appeal to those who like entrails, tough talk and bad endings. All others beware.__The film's conflicting tones never quite mesh, but some fine acting and powerful moments make "The Grey" watchable, if not entirely compelling.__It may be too conventional for the art-house crowd, yet too arty for the megaplex. I prefer to call it an unusually reflective blood-and-guts saga.__The film sustains some suspense and brooding atmosphere for its first half, but eventually the cliches of character and dialogue drag it struggling to ground.__What starts as a tense and moody survival thriller fairly quickly becomes tedious, forced and far-fetched as a septet of men is preyed upon by a wolf pack in the Alaska wilderness.__A handsome but gabby take on the standard survivalist thriller that's more concerned with lofty metaphysics than which poor blockhead is about to bite it next.__This gritty, relentlessly intense survival tale easily gets dibs on "feel-cold" movie of the year.__For all its macho standoffs and action set pieces and menacing off-screen howling, The Grey is at heart a simple moral fable about how true heroism consists in helping other human beings to live as long and die as well as they can.__Certainly an adventure film but one with a spiritual ingredient that is both surprising and fiercely resonant.__As stripped of colour as its title, apart from the red of flowing blood and burning eyes, The Grey urges contemplation on man as the human animal, one suddenly cast into the wilderness where real beasts dwell.__It's a fine, tough little movie, technically assured and brutally efficient, with a simple story that ventures into some profound existential territory without making a big fuss about it.__The Grey has a certain muscular pull: It's a tough-as-nails study of hardened men struggling with the ostensibly conflicting pulls of stoic masculinity on one hand and love, faith and fear of death on the other.__Devolves into a predictable man-against-nature, and man-against-fellow man, affair.__Memories of The Grey will melt away before spring's first sunny day, but it will satisfy both fans of Neeson's serious performances in films like Kinsey and those who line up for his more recent spate of I-will-kill-everyone flicks.
There's no sense of threat or danger: this is a film with its head stuck firmly in the clouds.__Sadly, Red Tails tells its inspiring story in the most old-fashioned, Saturday-afternoon-at-the-movies kind of way. The movie occasionally flies but it never soars.__This is so generic as storytelling that it fails even as a basic history lesson: it's hard to believe that the stock conflicts on-screen have any connection to real events.__One can get away with a lot of cornball speeches a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away but it doesn't work nearly as well a short time ago on planet Earth.__Red Tails is better than nothing - but "nothing" isn't the other option. That HBO film is still out there, and Red Tails doesn't add to it or improve upon it.__Instead of pride or anger or resolve, all it left me feeling was a little bit of regret that I hadn't been home, watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" instead.__The battle scenes soar, thanks to top-notch and thrilling special effects. Quieter scenes give characters added dimension, such as those that address one officer's drinking problem.__Red Tails is a lousy film. Not wincingly bad, mind you, just mediocre.__The Tuskegee Airmen were serious heroes, on a number of levels. They deserve a serious movie. "Red Tails" is not that movie.__The African American fliers' great achievement merits a great movie. "Red Tails" isn't it.__An inspiring, rousing tribute to the heroic, history-changing Tuskegee Airmen and World War II movies of the '40s, "Red Tails'' would probably be acclaimed as a minor masterpiece if it was directed by Quentin Tarantino.__The Tuskegee Airmen, the trailblazing African American pilots who fought off segregation and Nazis during World War II, merit a great film. "Red Tails" isn't it.__It's only half of a good movie. As soon as those dogfighting planes land, the story trips up by skimming the surface of history.__"Red Tails'' has its moments. They've just gone too far in the other direction. The movie is so desperate to be palatable, to appeal to everybody that it doesn't taste like anything.__It's antiquated kitsch reprocessed by the producer's nostalgia for the movies of his boyhood.__[It] sets out to honor these heroes, and does so - but in ways that reduce their achievements to the stuff of cartoons.__"Red Tails" has genuine admiration for the sacrifices and achievements made by the Tuskegee Airmen, but they deserve a better commemoration than this.__A feature film that falls much closer to the goofy Hogan's Heroes in the spectrum of World War II-focused productions than Saving Private Ryan.__The film's sincerity and good intentions shine through the hokum.__More often than not, Red Tails feels like it's pandering to every focus group that it never even tested... It's so cautious as to be lifeless, which is a shame on a lot of levels.
Director Ole Bornedal doesn't add a single idea of his own.__There may be need for an exorcist, but the power of Christ isn't going to compel the Jewish demon wreaking havoc in this competent but shopworn horror film.__The first half of The Possession is suitably atmospheric and reasonably creepy.__The film is basically a compendium of possessed-child cliches reaching back to The Exorcist.__Another horror movie about a little girl possessed by a demon? Seriously?__The script, credited to Juliet Snowden and Stiles White, adheres so closely to formula that it's possible to predict not only which characters will end up dead, but in what order ...__Anyone who actually believes in dybbuks and other ghoulies will find "The Possession" terrifying. For the rest of us, the movie is a cleverly constructed, well-paced piece of hokum.__A better-than-most fright-time tale ...__Even if you resist the film's claims of being based on one family's actual experiences, "The Possession" is eerily enjoyable pulp.__This is a lugubrious, lovingly crafted B movie, with more than a little 1970s flavor but no arch postmodern attitude.__The obvious bid for an unwarranted sequel at the end of The Possession suggest that Raimi, once hailed for his vision, is now content to just milk his cows and count his cash.__The evil spirit in "The Possession" should be embarrassed to call itself a demon.__Danish director Ole Bornedal has made some fine films in his career. The Possession isn't one of them.__"The Possession" is morally lazy.__Rather than embellish imaginatively, screenwriter Leslie Gornstein seems to have re-watched The Exorcist, Poltergeist and The Unborn for inspiration.__The Possession offers a steady stream of chuckles and a few big laughs. Unfortunately, it isn't a comedy ...__"The Possession" isn't exactly "The Exorcist," but Ole Bornedal's film hits enough high notes to make it a worthwhile addition to the exorcism-film heap, somewhere in the lower middle.__Slick direction and a strong central turn from Jeffrey Dean Morgan will keep you watching, if rarely from the edge of your seat.__Nothing earthshaking, but a pretty scary night out...__"The Exorcist" has influenced a lot of films, and this is one of the better ones.
Viewers enduring early adolescence or those grappling with its psychic scars will recognize the honesty in the comic humiliation.__Though often self-centered and conniving, Greg remains a likable kid, and the movie entertains by pulling off over-the-top scenarios that set up digestible life lessons for youngsters.__Released right when summer starts to drag, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days at least doesn't add to the exhaustion.__Old-fashioned and small in scale, the movies sometimes feel like after-school specials from a bygone era, which is part of what makes them so endearing.__I'd call "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days" harmless if it weren't for some totally unnecessary gay-panic jokes that could actually encourage bullying.__Spending time with Kinney's characters has become an annual treat.__Real emotions get expressed. Real family harmony emerges.__Ends the series' winning streak, or at least slows it down to a panting, dog-day crawl.__It all makes for goofy fun, and physical comedy that will have parents rolling their eyes.__The execution isn't great. David Bowers, the director, allows too much hammy acting.__...I think it's possible that all tween audiences, wimpy or not, deserve better than this.__The sort of mischief that felt cutely wise-alecky up to this point often just doesn't work here.__[It's] formulaic in adhering to the sitcom-style tone of the first two films.__The third time might not be the charm, but this harmless family comedy proves more pleasant than its episodic 2011 installment.__Either they're getting better as they go along, or they're wearing me down.__We jump back and forth between so many other half-hearted threads that it can feel a bit like surfing between channels that strictly show episodes of a never-made "Wimpy Kid" TV show.__Like a kid in a mid-day algebra class, "Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Dog Days" only wakes up for the louder, crasser jokes its pals crack.__The third installment in the "Wimpy Kid" franchise turns out to be not so wimpy after all.__It is less unified and more predictable than its predecessors, and doesn't play to all the franchise's earlier strengths.__Diary Of A Wimpy Kid benefits from not trying too hard, but it wouldn't hurt if it had tried just a little bit harder anyway.
More stupid than scary, Sinister can't even figure out who its real demon is.__It comes together with a gruesome though excellent ending that some will find difficult to shake.__A mixed bag of old-school and contemporary horror tricks that occasionally raises a hair prickle of intrigue.__Despite some effective bumps and frights, and at least one memorable jolt from a full-throated D'Addario, "Sinister" is mainly just a series of snuff-reels with sick-joke titles ...__C'mon, Ethan Hawke, you're better than this. Isn't there a "Before Sunset" sequel that needs your attention?__The hero of "Sinister" is almost unaccountably dumb. So, unfortunately, is the movie.__As the best horror stories so often do, "Sinister" makes clear that we are our own boogeymen, the worst monsters of all.__In its plot and even its title, the movie feels like a grab bag of every popular horror trope of the last 30 years.__As much as "Sinister" wants to tell a story, there isn't much of a story to be told.__Relies more on "gotcha" moments than storytelling.__Now this is a scary movie. And, given that it's a horror film, that means it's a good one.__[Director Scott Derrickson finds] new ways to frame the same rooms from one scene to the next and providing comic relief whenever the action threatens to turn monotonously grim.__The movie is full of feints, shocks and scenes of particularly perverse violence, but nothing about it is fresh enough to haunt you in the night. It's predictable.__In true horror movie tradition, characters do things that are head-scratchingly dumb. Once you accept those logic-defying moments, the movie works with diabolical effectiveness.__Sinister' may make you jump at predictable intervals, but it never rattles your existential certainties the way truly subversive horror does.__There's something smarter, and truly creepy-crawly, about the way this movie sneaks up on your ears.__That title is off the mark. Here's a better one: "Stupid."__An occult thriller that scares with an absolute relentlessness.__"Sinister" is an undeniably scary movie, with performances adding enough human interest to give depth to the basic building blocks of horror.__I knew perfectly well, after a while, what Sinister was going to scare me with. But I got scared anyway.
It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit.__It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off.__Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents... But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past.__Magic.__A lovely film that ranks with the best of Disney's animated classics.__What you gain in an extra, faked dimension you lose in lively, genuine beauty.__The set pieces are narcotically pleasing, especially the Busby Berkeley-style dancing-kitchenware spectacular, "Be Our Guest," and the romantic ballroom centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together.__The 3-D pops out to enhance the drama or energy of scenes in which settings are large and integral to the action.__Some youthful memories are better not revisited, but this definitely isn't one of them. Sometimes you can go home again.__Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children.__It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right.__Despite some excessive narrative streamlining, this 1991 release was the best Disney animated feature in years, full of charm and humor.__Its animators' pens are wands; their movement enchants.__A uniquely elegant and entertaining mix of hand-drawn classicism and high-tech innovation.__[A] great film...__There's still room in this world for innocent love stories -- and tales as old as time.__Brims with charm, style, and flawless execution that doesn't feel the least bit dated by subsequent technological advancements.__It's not an especially scary movie, but right from the start, you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite.__A sporadically brilliant escape that at times stops to preen and pose, like that he-man lout Gaston.__In the Imax format, the introduction of the Beast's castle has a breathtaking 3-D effect. And throughout the film, you see textures and details you never noticed.
The film would have been so much more interesting if the two men had been identical twins played by the same actor-like Jeremy Irons in David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers.__It all smacks of trying too hard to mask the absence of strong material.__Stone devotes considerable ingenuity to making atrocity appear as a terrifying kind of home movie, but "Savages" is no more than a summertime debauch.__These are neither good people nor interesting savages, and they're not worth caring about. Neither is the movie.__Savages points to a problem with gifted directors, which Stone is, like him or not: They can make a movie that aggravates, infuriates, falters even, but they can really make a movie.__Savages isn't about anything except flashily directed mayhem. In this nest of vipers, it's the slitheriest varieties that survive -- at least for a time.__The movie's great surprise, and delight, is Salma Hayek's Elena, a svelte monster with a Cleopatra haircut who runs the cartel.__The film is impressive.__The real schism here, however, is between the brainless fun of the action plot and Stone's cheap exploitation of the cartels' real-life sadism.__Stone has evolved in the past decade and a half, and the new film has a deeper, more complicated perspective. The violence isn't a kick. It's horrifying, senseless.__The occasionally sharp tone of Don Winslow's original novel has been lost, and the film's ending isn't much more than a joke.__A candy-colored black valentine to titillation, garish brutality and groovy post-fin-de-siecle excess, this ode to cinema's most exploitative pleasures finds Stone chronicling America's dark side at its most sun-kissed.__This Elmore Leonard-style noir about lowlifes versus dirtbags is nasty, vicious fun.__"Savages" makes you wonder where Stone, that most pointed of directors, is going. And then it never gets there, backing off at the last minute. As such, it is literally a brutal disappointment.__It all feels more like flexing atrophied muscles rather than creating a believable experience.__"Savages" is a juvenile fantasy of bullets, breasts and bongs -- not such a bad thing, if Stone would just admit it and stop staging the film as a profound ethical wrestling match.__Complain as loudly as you like about Oliver Stone - his politics, posturing and relationship with the facts - but until now he hasn't directed a film that's flat-out dull.__While Savages aims for provocative and dynamic, it comes off as predictable and strained.__You might not think that a motion picture called "Savages" could be too violent, too savage, but you would be wrong.__How did this film end up with such a muddled story?
__As for the Marigold Hotel, well, it's not the Delano. But overall it's a fine spot to spend a couple of hours.__Basically, there's just too much crammed into "Marigold Hotel" for any of it to have impact. It may work as comfort food for old folks, but a bit less may have yielded a great deal more.__The movie itself is a mawkish comedy-drama-romance, but the astounding cast makes it feel like a night on the West End.__"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" is an Indian dish for day-trippers. Lacking beef or sufficient spice, it's nonetheless colorful comfort food.__The old pros elevate Hotel's otherwise pat screenplay into that sweet spot where predictability fails to negate pleasure.__There's little that's surprising about the film - everyone ends up pretty much where you'd guess - but that predictable quality becomes part of the pleasure of watching it, like a book that's happily reread.__They're stuck with a script, by Ol Parker, that's stuffed with contrivance and cliche, and doggedly repetitive as it tracks its characters' efforts to find new love and adapt to new surroundings.__The witty script, Eastern locale, and tony cast may summon up memories of the old Merchant-Ivory films.__The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is an ersatz experience, a commingling of forced uplift and exotica, but it's moving anyway.__There are brutal truths about the declining years in Best Exotic, from loneliness to financial woes that can't be solved by getting a new job, but they are amply padded with comedy and cheery messages about acceptance; this is no bitter pill to swallow.__It's hard to complain too much when your leads are Dench and Smith, Nighy and Wilkinson - all giving an actor's master class in the power of doing just enough.__A refreshing, mature fairy tale with a top-notch ensemble cast.__With its stereotypical characters and creaky plot turns, this passage to India feels even longer than its running time.__The entertainment that one is able to derive from it is directly proportional to the appeal of each character. Those levels vary widely.__"Marigold Hotel" is too well made to be dismissed and contains too much truth to be scorned.__Those who will see The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are looking for something calm, safe, gently humorous, and entirely unchallenging. And that's exactly what they get.__It's a cup of tea made no less satisfying by the fact that you'll know how it's going to taste every sip of the way.__Besides its sterling cast, its ace in the hole is its pungent depiction of Jaipur's teeming streets, which give an otherwise well-mannered movie a blinding splash of color.__It all makes for a movie whose infectious charm outweighs some of the predictability that slips in around the edges.
The film is frequently funny, always elegant (or mock-elegant), and something that would make Humbert Humbert laugh all the way to his asylum.__Most of Wes Anderson's previous pictures came from the head; Moonrise Kingdom is one from the heart.__Anderson never loses his core themes - young love, the need to escape, the bind and bluster of family. His "Kingdom" may not be large, but it is perfectly appointed.__Phonies may complain that Anderson's island of misfit toys is a retreat from the real world, but for pure-hearted adventurers who share the secret map, "Moonrise Kingdom" is a joy that cannot be eclipsed.__Though undeniably smart and charming, "Moonrise Kingdom" loves itself the way the callow Holden Caulfield loves himself: unconditionally. Salinger understood the problem with that. Anderson may not.__"Moonrise Kingdom" takes place in a world where everything seems pleasantly faded, where people read crackly-covered library books rather than e-books, and where young people are allowed to be genuinely innocent.__The latest unadulterated delight from Wes Anderson, director of "Rushmore," "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "Fantastic Mr. Fox."__The usual complaints and caveats about Anderson - he's precious, his characters have no grounding in the real world - can be made about Moonrise Kingdom, but so what?__Anderson and his actors are able to convey more genuine feeling through these devices than most filmmakers can with more-traditional means.__One knock against some of Anderson's previous efforts is that they're too clever - so clever, in fact, that the humanity gets sucked out of them. That doesn't happen here.__Anderson's best feature since Rushmore, in part because, like that film, it takes as its primary subject matter odd, precocious children, rather than the damaged and dissatisfied adults they will one day become.__There's no denying the extravagant pleasures "Moonrise Kingdom" affords as an erudite wish-fulfillment fantasy of empowerment and autonomy.__Last time out, in Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson adapted a children's book by Roald Dahl. Now, in Moonrise Kingdom, he's made one of his own.__It's an adventure, a love story, a biblical allegory complete with approaching storm, a mash note to composer Benjamin Britten and a profoundly touching discourse on the needs of troubled children.__"Moonrise Kingdom" is Anderson's seventh movie, and it's the first since "Rushmore" that works from the opening shot to the final image.__It's a fable about what it feels like to be 12 years old and afflicted, from head to toe, by a romantic crush the size of a planet.__Like all Wes Anderson movies, it is naive, mannered, pretentious and incomprehensible.__Wes Anderson's mind must be an exciting place for a story idea to be born.__Wes Anderson's most intimate film since Bottle Rocket (1996) and maybe his most deeply felt overall.__Hayward and Gilman are newcomers who are asked to carry much of the film and pull it off with lovely understatement and extraordinary believability.
Weak humor and vanilla plotting have replaced legitimate drama, pathos, and character development.__It's nice that the hero goes to the mat for what he believes in. But he's not the only thing that comes down with a thud.__It delivers exactly what's expected from a flabby mishmash of high school inspirational tale and Mixed Martial Arts fighting exhibitionism ladled out by Adam Sandler running mate Frank Coraci ...__Here Comes the Boom will probably connect like a haymaker with most of its intended audience. The leads are likeable, and the plot, though beyond incredible, is at the very least distracting.__Why doesn't most of this movie take place in a coma ward?__"Here Comes the Boom" is so full of cliches from other, better movies that it is almost plays like a parody of an underdog tale.__"Here Comes the Boom'' is low on raunch but even lower on laughs. It also looks like half the lighting crew failed to show up.__For the most part, "Boom" lazily follows Adam Sandler's proven recipe for box-office success.__Cage fighting is not inherently funny. In fact, it's the opposite of funny, something like cock fighting only with people, and this presents a problem the movie never completely overcomes.__A moderately enjoyable, nontaxing sort of comedy.__The film works hard at its inoffensiveness. Throughout, jokes are left on the table, setups never pay off in any significant way.__Here Comes the Boom telegraphs every punch in its arsenal, but when the comedy connects, it can deliver with funny force.__[It] delivers repeated blows - to the abdomen, to the head, and to the groin, but not often enough to the funny bone.__The film would have the same audience that came to see James get elbowed in the face also get weepy over disadvantaged schoolchildren.__Loud, incoherent and unfunny, "Here Comes the Boom" is the sound of American culture imploding.__Call it Waiting for Superman Punch.__"Here Comes the Boom" is all banality, though it delivers some goodwill even as it pulls a muscle trying to get its premise going.__'Rocky' for fifth graders, with enough pro-school propaganda to make parents think it's worth the price of popcorn__For a film dedicated to time-tested formula and clumsily cross-pollinating Rocky and Mr. Holland's Opus, Here Comes The Boom is hilariously convoluted and inefficient in its storytelling.__Once it gets going and commits to its time-worn inspirational formula, it's not half-bad.
It's Friday Night Lights territory, but without good writing or acting.__Red Dawn suffers from a number of serious problems. The first, and most obvious, is that this is mini-series material compressed into a 95-minute movie.__Take that, screaming North Koreans with no agenda!__Preposterously insincere ...__John Milius's 1984 cult classic about American teens battling a Soviet invasion has been reinvented as a Tea Party wet dream that offers a scathing (if completely illogical) indictment of the federal government.__Hobbled by a laughably bad script and a uniformly uncharismatic cast.__North Koreans? Falling from the sky? Seriously?__Just really, really lame, right down to the Communist symbols that adorn the revised Stars and Stripes.__An even odder war story than the bluntly provocative, Reagan-era original.__Red Dawn without the jingoism is like a pie without the filling-it collapses into splintered mush.__The more ludicrous a concept, the more crucial it is that the director embrace the bigger-than-life absurdity. But everything about this project feels small-time.__Despite the more realistic battle scenes, nothing in it feels more fateful than a football game.__It's Kim Jong-un versus Some Young Dumb 'Uns.__I think I'm beginning to understand why the Chinese were not reckoned to be a prime market for this film.__Could be fun, you might think. No. Bad acting and worse dialogue quickly put an end to that notion.__A movie in search of its moment.__Bradley ... handles the low-fi action well, which helps divert attention from the bargain-bin special effects, bad acting and politics.__Was anybody out there clamoring for a remake of "Red Dawn"? Show of hands? Anybody?__Scenes are rather murkily shot and characters are like cardboard cutouts.__[Its] portrayal of violence derives more from video games than from history.
'The Three Stooges' is exactly the film it wants to be. Was it worth ten years of anyone's life? Probably not. Is it worth 88 minutes of yours? Absolutely.__The movie is so infantile that it achieves a special kind of purity and gentleness.__The metafriction between these classic dupes and today's idiots chafes uneasily.__The leads acquit themselves in the physical comedy, resurrecting shtick honed on a thousand-and-one vaudeville stages, and recreated in as many playgrounds.__Any reasonable objections to the Farrellys' Three Stooges will not be on the grounds that it desecrates a revered comedy franchise, but on the grounds that it's not very funny.__If this is a tribute, it's a crass and clumsy one.__For the Farrellys, The Three Stooges is a labor of love. For non-believers, it's merely a labor.__Even by Stooges standards, it's overly juvenile and totally dumb.__You would think that after a quarter-century in development at four different studios, somebody would have figured out how to make a funny movie about the Three Stooges.__The Three Stooges weighs in at about 15 howlers over 90 minutes. Not bad, about the same ratio of hilarity to hokey as the Stooges' old shorts.__The Three Stooges is moronic, stupid, idiotic entertainment for knuckleheads.__It's an enchantingly well-done tribute that revives, and even refreshes, our affection for the Stooges, yet at its core it lacks the completely and totally unhinged shock of the new.__There is an appealing nyuk, nyuk nostalgic spirit to"The Three Stooges."__Pop culture references intermingle with the loopy trio's iconic foolishness, and the result is a movie with some big laughs, plenty of heart and terrible coifs.__Get ready for something more shocking than a poke in the eye: The Three Stooges is genuinely funny, a no-holds-barred, smart-stupid comedy that (at the screening I attended, anyway) will win over Stooge-philes and non-believers alike.__It pleases me to report that the movie is far from a disaster - on a dozen or so occasions, it's even funny.__There is hardly a smidgeon of comic invention here.__Peter and Bobby Farrelly's thoroughly enjoyable paean to Moe, Larry and Curly and the art of the eye poke.__It's a concept that shouldn't work at all. But - who'da thunk it? - it's better than a hammer to the head.__I spent a lot of "The Three Stooges" staring, not laughing. For me this was a stare-out-loud affair.
The script is incoherent and the acting is terrible -- avatars would have been an improvement.__Thuddingly awful.__Some sequels suggest that no one involved with a franchise really cares anymore.__A zombie plague may have laid waste the world, but apparently supplies of black leather unitards have yet to be exhausted.__During the film's final sequence the director explains all while also suggesting that the franchise's nuttiest days are, remarkably, yet to come.__The acting is sometimes shockingly bad, but generally the script doesn't ask much of the actors, and the combat is effectively staged and often thrilling.__Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson ... attempts to fill out a flimsy plot structure by making the characters' comings and goings overly convoluted.__Diagramming every revolution of Jovovich in wheeling and whirling action, however, Anderson is pitch-perfect when singing the body electric.__If they ran these scenes at normal speed, would 95 dreary minutes become a much more expedient 20 to 25?__Endless video-game-style, violent mayhem is on display in this latest edition of the mind-numbing apocalypse series.__Like an established pizza chain, director Anderson is in thrall to a guarantee: all relationships, of any significance, will be established in three seconds or less.__It's all the same blah-blah carnage as the first four flicks, with 3D effects hurling blood, blades and body parts into the audience amid a non-stop barrage of gunfire and explosions.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The filmmakers are less interested in providing a slow buildup to their frights than in splattering the cliches of the form in funny, spirited ways.__In order to subvert any popular form, entertainment first has to work on its own terms. Goddard and Whedon are too busy geeking out to bother with those requirements.__The setup is intriguing but the balance feels off. Goddard and Whedon overplay the winking postmodernism.__One of the best movies of 2012 so far, in any genre.__By the time the ride is over, director Drew Goddard and co-writers Goddard and Joss Whedon will change course three or four times, nodding and winking but never losing momentum.__And you thought you were just headed for a weekend getaway.__A horror movie embedded in a conspiracy flick embedded in another horror movie-the most inventive cabin-in-the-woods picture since The Evil Dead and the canniest genre deconstruction since Scream.__The climactic one-two punch of special-effects chaos and meta-movie chin stroking should have the fanboys trembling with delight.__"The Cabin in the Woods" gets at the story underneath the story, and the reason behind the cliches.__If it's true that you always kill the thing you love, then horror honchos Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard have taken an ax to slasher cinema in The Cabin in the Woods and chopped it up for kindling.__Everything about "The Cabin in the Woods" is a delicious practical joke...__For all of its many intellectual pleasures, and smart commentary, Cabin in the Woods is a visceral roller coaster of a movie at heart. And like the best thrill rides, when it's over, you just want to get back on and go again.__Cabin is a meta-horror-comedy mash-up that, at least for two-thirds of its running time, holds together smartly.__Movies that mean to deconstruct movies seem to be made solely by and for cinema vampires, those ghost-faced geeks whose pallor is rarely challenged by exposure to the sun.__A pulpy, deceivingly insightful send-up of horror movies that elicits just as many knowing chuckles as horrified gasps.__If you like nutty energy, wacky ideas, crisp dialogue and scary, bloody, gory, grotesque and twisted movies - man, are you going to have a blast this weekend.__You needn't be a fanboy to enjoy the moment when the ride really takes off and the spectacle flowers. A scary imagination will do just fine.__Quite a bit of it is great, and most of it works, and the stuff that clicks is outrageously entertaining and funny, sometimes with surprising depth.__Though there are plot holes in the elaborately concocted scenarios, The Cabin in the Woods gets points for the twists and turns that come along with its sly wickedness.__The filmmakers have a real love for the horror genre and its tropes and archetypes, and while much of what goes on here will have special resonance for fellow buffs, you don't have to be a scholar of spooky movies to appreciate how the story's being told.
Technically the genre isn't beneath contempt. But this movie is.__Bringing a child into the world is no laughing matter, and all involved seem to have done their level best to make things as mirthless as possible.__Babies are cute and expectant parents often aren't. That kind of sums up What to Expect When You're Expecting.__Director Kirk Jones and screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach consistently fall back on corny music and slow-motion to try to get laughs. Very little of this movie feels risky, or even frisky.__Patently contrived to deliver the safer side of pregnancy-related humor over the course of five tidily intersecting plot lines.__Remember when advice books stayed on the shelves where they belonged?__It's a sitcom-y ensemble film (complete with product placement) that feels like you're flipping around the TV dial.__"What to Expect" rolls out this shocking revelation: Having kids is a messy and complicated process.__The film is dully shot and so predictably plotted, you could tick off the items like you're packing a bag for the delivery room.__The movie turns out to be a little of everything yet succeeds only occasionally at anything.__"What to Expect" isn't an inspired movie, but a manufactured one, but one with some laughs and some moments.__What audiences should expect is a tone-deaf, superficial, charmless ensemble rom-com, focused on five attractive, but uninteresting, couples.__Cute couple Kendrick and Crawford are completely lost at sea. But the guys in the Dudes Group have the worst of it - they are a whiny, unappealing bunch through and through.__In a year when women's reproductive freedoms are constantly in the political crosshairs, What to Expect When You're Expecting feels like just another affront to anyone who owns and operates a uterus.__The writing is sharp and the performances bright, and if you've been through the forced gestational march known as pregnancy, there are knowing laughs to be had.__The still-born What To Expect... is an all-star dud that could be easily confused with Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve, except for the absence of Ashton Kutcher.__An amiable but disjointed movie with too many stories and not enough storytelling.__It makes one long for the comparative complexity and subtlety of Valentine's Day.__What you don't expect is how bad almost all of it is.__Exactly what you'd expect. And that's not a good thing.
Ayer and his cast appear to have so convincingly nailed the way these characters talk and act that you might not even notice the film slipping from workaday grit into out-and-out myth.__The actors, both excellent, get right into Ayer's groove. So by the time we arrive at the unsparing climax, we really know and care about these guys.__Gyllenhaal and Pena are after a lived-in camaraderie and a street-level realism. Pena, especially, succeeds; you buy him every second.__The performances here are so sharp that viewers may wish End of Watch has been shot by someone who knew how to find the right point of view for a scene and leave it there.__Intermittently enjoyable but incredibly frustrating.__Jumpy and exciting.__The ingredients in [this] cop drama are as routine as a traffic stop. But director/writer David Ayer (who wrote the electric good-cop/bad-cop  Training Day) makes it work.__Both actors are marvelous -- this may be the most nuanced and far-ranging performance Gyllenhaal has ever given -- and writer-director David Ayer is unapologetically frank about the dangers these men face.__I'm not sure who appointed David Ayer poet laureate for the LAPD, but at least he takes the job seriously.__End of Watch suffers from no end of sanctimony.__Ayer ... keeps wrecking the sense of realism he's trying to build.__Gyllenhaal and the perpetually under-rated Pena have a wonderful way of bouncing off one another and Ayers is wise to make this the energy that drives the movie instead of mere violence.__Gyllenhaal and Pena have great chemistry together ... in their best performances to date.__A portrait of law enforcement under pressure that is as ennobling as it is gritty.__A visceral story of beat cops that is rare in its sensitivity, rash in its violence and raw in its humor.__The best scenes are filmed inside the cruiser, dashboard shots that face inward instead of out, catching Gyllenhaal and Pena in moments so playful and true they make all other buddy cops look bogus by comparison.__Writer/director David Ayer gives us an authentic, sometimes shockingly gruesome ride along.__The shaky camera work -- often a gimmicky stylistic option -- is an effective choice here, both as a story element and a technique.__It's not a pretty job. But it's a pretty awesome film.__A muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances.
Rock of Ages is not a spoof, but it might as well be, given how little there is to root for.__...a cinematic endeavor that, for all intents and purposes, is asking the consumer to put down his or her money to watch movie stars do karaoke.__Cruise, as Stacee Jaxx, is the living embodiment of a rock god.__Every time an actor belts out a hit, you're reminded that the original, however cheesy, was better.__The movie's supporting stars are always, inevitably, winking at the audience, but it's unclear whether the dewy-eyed leads even know how to blink.__Pour some sugar on it, indeed.__The film's problems begin with who it cast as its leads.__Far too mild for its supposedly outrageous subject.__Cruise once again steals the show, but this time he drives it straight off a cliff.__For the most part, rock and roll should feel insulted.__This plodding mess may help put to rest Hollywood's inexplicable two-decade love affair with the awful '80s, a pop- culture decade that's overdue for a break.__It's content to keep toes tapping, when it should be bringing the arena to its feet.__Don't stop believing. Just avoid cliched musicals that try to capture the anarchic spirit of rock with trite commercial re-treads.__No matter how you feel about Guns N' Roses, Tom Cruise's as a bandanna-headed Axl Rose type will hit you as the purest bit of genius in the man's entire film career.__However you play up this material -- as camp, melodrama, anthem, or goof -- it sags under the weight of its lightweight pretensions.__Blessed with unstoppable energy, an undeniably bawdy sense of fun and Tom Cruise in backless leather pants, it takes songs you may never have loved and turns them into a musical that's easy to enjoy.__What's not fine is the dead zone occupied by the monster of the piece, Tom Cruise's veteran rocker, Stacee Jaxx.__Just like the music, it's far more fun than it has any right being.__There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours than with this odd assortment of courageous thespians bringin' on the heartbreak, and feelin' the noize.__So willfully bad that not even Cruise's valiant CPR can help.
The violence quickly becomes numbing, and Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln without the sense of irony needed to keep the historical and supernatural sides of the story consistently entertaining.__The movie plays safe by cutting every theme down the middle - a swing that's effective when splitting wood or vampire skulls, but dull when applied to filmmaking.__Of course it's ridiculous and tasteless and grotesque. It's ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER.__The disconnect between intention and final product is a head scratcher.__Bekmambetov doesn't expect us to take the premise seriously, exactly. But he doesn't seem to want us to laugh at it, either.__Bekmambetov ... stages hilarious, imaginative, almost free-form action sequences like nobody in the business.__A B movie treated like an A movie that mostly ends up being a zzzzzzzzzz movie.__This film should be campy fun, but in Bekmambetov's unsteady hands, it feels laboured and unsatisfying.__The trouble with the so-called high-concept film is that too often the concept is the best thing about it and the actual movie essentially a series of rather rote, progressively more tiresome variations on its premise.__Not just a letdown but an absolute disaster.__What next, "George Washington Werewolf"? Laugh not, history profs.__Don't let the stupid title dissuade you from seeing "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter." Let the stupid plot, the stupid history, the stupid action scenes, the stupid trivializing of slavery . . .__Both terribly silly and a lot of fun.__Walker is a tall, lean guy with a big hat who can swing an ax. What else can be said?__Despite its factual dismemberment of the movie's namesake, Hunter bristles as summer action fodder. Honest.__Here is the worst thing to happen to Abe Lincoln in a theater since he attended "Our American Cousin."__Someone forgot to tell the filmmakers ... that the movie was supposed to be fun. Or at least smart.__Given the subject matter, an exercise in delicacy and restraint was unlikely, but it's too bad that the film's concept is way more entertaining than what has ended up on-screen.__"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" is such a smashing title it's too bad someone had to spoil things by making a movie to go with it.__To say that it's an exercise in style over substance is perhaps an overstatement, in that it suggests there's any substance here at all.
It's slight and casual to the point of laziness, but it's straight fun, done with knowledge and a laconic pleasure. You could do far worse.__The center of narrative gravity is hard to locate; for whom are we rooting, and does anything really ripple outward from this nasty local fight?__Fans of The Proposition will have to settle for sublimely evil performances by Gary Oldman (as a murderous rival) and Guy Pearce (as a government agent) and a large quotient of gut-wrenching violence.__With a dynamite cast, an iconic screenwriter in rocker Nick Cave and an Aussie director in John Hillcoat, you assume a new classic. What you get is an ambitious try.__You can sense the filth, and smell the rust, and feel the ingrained poverty that might well convince a family of survivors (of World War I and the Spanish flu) to make their fortune selling moonshine to their neighbors.__There's something at the movie's heart that remains flimsy and inauthentic, a kid in his older brother's ill-fitting shoes.__Much of the action may be nearly as grim as in director John Hillcoat's previous feature, "The Road" - "Lawless" is very bloody - but the scenery and production design are a whole lot nicer.__This isn't to say that there's not enough here, but just don't look for it all to add up.__Lawless is filled with forbidding shadows and verdant abundance, contrasting the indifference of nature with the violence of the humanity within it.__I can only admire this film's craftsmanship and acting, and regret its failure to rise above them.__"Lawless" offers a compelling, gruesome and instructive time-travel exercise.__Based on a novel by Dallas-based Matt Bondurant about his family's real-life bootlegging past, it's a violent, brooding portrait of brotherhood in trying times.__At its core, this is a film about men doing violence to men. And they do plenty of it.__The unflinching slicing and dicing is viscerally brutal, but without sufficient character development Lawless simply feels lifeless.__This is a well-made movie that deserves a higher profile than it is being accorded.__Ultimately, "Lawless" is just another gangster movie, and not a very good one ...__The action is, overall, as exciting as the primary performances are impressive.__This should've been a really good picture, especially with Hillcoat's crack ensemble. Instead it's a stilted battle waged between the material and the interpreters.__An inescapable sense of "so what?" sets in early with "Lawless," almost as soon as Shia LaBeouf begins his lackluster opening narration.__A story of entrepreneurship, of family, of fighting for one's rights - the right to make white lightning, and money. It's as American as apple pie.
Andrew [Rogen], who has invented an organic cleaning compound, pitches it to retailers in a succession of meetings across the country that have no grounding in any known reality.__The Guilt Trip pairs Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand in the hope, no doubt, that sparks will fly. They don't.__Rogen and Streisand are reasonably funny together, though Rogen, always best when he's angry, is crowded into the role of a well-mannered straight man.__To its detriment, The Guilt Trip opts to work gently on the heart rather than hard on the funny bone.__A breezy, funny and warm road-trip comedy.__The Guilt Trip is clearly targeted at older audiences less than receptive to the crude jokes that made Seth Rogen famous.__It zigs when you expect it to zag. It's perceptive and thoughtful as it swerves around potholes that easily could have broken an axle.__It takes more than a few wrong turns. And once you've reached the end, you have no urge to ever do it again.__While Streisand and Rogen's relationship is smartly, affectionately drawn, just about every other element of the movie feels perfunctory ...__[It] doesn't take every predictable detour, but it takes enough that the movie never ceases to feel overly familiar.__"The Guilt Trip" is tripe, but it's tripe that knows its audience. Seriously, take your mother. It'll be a mitzvah.__Streisand and Rogen have expert instincts, and their interplay is a pleasure to watch. And the movie is surprisingly gentle in its application of conventional movie wisdom and avoidance of easy gross-out humor.__[A] lifeless comedy about an overbearing mother and her exasperated adult son ...__Eight days in a car with these two is like eight weeks with shingles.__Are we there yet?__These two have the aging mother-son dynamic of kvetching, fawning and battling down so well the film is sold right from the beginning.__No movie should credibly simulate the experience of being stuck in a car with Barbra Streisand for eight days. Not unless it's being billed as "a spine-tingling tale of modern horror."__Embarrassing dreck, masquerading as comedy ...__This is one seriously uncomfortable movie, especially considering that it's being presented as a feel-good comedy.__The Guilt Trip works because we all know and like a Joyce Brewster (or dozens of them).
The basic joke keeps on giving and the sweetness of the parent-child bonding scenes plays well.__It points you toward the irresistible conclusion that for all his success Sandler feels only contempt for his audience and tremendous insecurity about his own stature in the comedy universe.__Surprisingly mean-spirited from start to finish.__Sandler's latest wicked pissah, a paean to let-it-all-hang-out party-guy sloppiness...__If someone told you about almost every joke in That's My Boy, you would think they were either a sociopath or a budding serial killer.__Vulgar, tasteless, mean-spirited and most offensive of all--not funny.__Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch something funnier than That's My Boy. It's a video of my mother being torn apart by bears. Good day.__Most of this is just gross without being funny, full of the go-to jokes (fat people running! old people talking dirty!) that only dirty-minded kids would laugh at.__Is it time for Adam Sandler to stop appearing in his own movies?__On some level I marveled at the conviction that Adam Sandler pours into playing a character like Donny Berger, a boneheaded, loud-mouthed alcoholic loser from Boston.__Will be construed by the faithful as an embarrassment of riches and by the rest of us as cruel and unusual punishment...__Sandler's Berger is the most loutish, annoying character he's come up with since "Little Nicky." Nicky came from hell; viewers of "That's My Boy" will feel like they're in it.__The script sometimes seems to have been written by a 13-year-old.__Central to the movie's deficiencies is Sandler's inability to create a comic character.__Mr. Sandler manages a frame or so of genuine sentiment, and the caricature is so ugly it's cute. He's a performer, and there are moments when audiences will surrender to his shtick. Moments.__Another bottom-of-the-barrel raunchfest that is bound to make far more money than such sludge could ever deserve.__How did American comedies come to rely on raunch rather than wordplay?__That's My Boy isn't a comedy about a regressive '80s burnout who never grew up, but a paean to the virtues of remaining the same vulgar, bullying nincompoop at 40 that you were at 14.__A thousand times better and funnier than Jack and Jill, Sandler's last movie, yet still falls short of actually being good...__Lowbrow comedy goes subterranean in "That's My Boy," a product of the Adam Sandler movie factory unpolluted by a trace of ambition or wit.
For all its occasional tin ear, Dr Phil dialogue, its contrivances and shortcuts, this remains a fundamentally sound and solid entertainment with a deep-rooted conviction that how we treat each other matters.__Eastwood and Adams do the best they can with the cornball sentimentality and cheesy dialogue, but first-time director Robert Lorenz merely photographs the on- and off-field action. Give it a pass.__Lorenz ... lays in everything methodically, fully, but without much invention or energy; you can imagine each plot development ten minutes before it arrives.__Eastwood, in his 80s, looks a lot trimmer than some of the performers in this film half his age. He may be the only octogenarian actor who has to play older than his age to be convincing.__Nobody would pay much attention to this plodding but good-hearted film if not for its star, Clint Eastwood, although he's just dialing in the go-to Cantankerous Old Man mode on which he has relied for a decade or so.__This isn't the worst performance Eastwood has given in his 57-year career, but it's his least inspired in about a decade.__Trouble With the Curve" is a solid double down the line.__[There] are powerful scenes, not because of what we've invested in this pleasant film, but what we've invested in Eastwood.__If you give it a chance to work its quiet magic, it might make your day.__Robert Lorenz, Eastwood's longtime assistant director, moves up to the lead spot but can't do anything with Randy Brown's ham-fisted script.__Even if Eastwood's grumpy old man routine wears you down - it's perhaps too much of a not-very-good thing - there are lots of terrific second bananas.__Trouble with the Curve is one of those easy-going old-time movies that they say studios don't make anymore. They still do on occasion, but you need a guy like Clint Eastwood to pull them off.__One of those schematic by-the-number jobs that telegraphs its every pitch.__"Trouble With the Curve" as predictable and suspenseless as a children's film. It's a softball straight down the middle.__Steeerike!__At times, "Trouble With the Curve" is just as smart as "Moneyball," which it all but challenges to a fight.__What promised to be a modest, refreshingly unforced little comedy turns out to be low energy to a fault.__Its title notwithstanding, there's nothing that remotely approaches a narrative curve ball in this tired saga of an aging baseball scout.__Muttering in a hoarse whisper, stooping just a bit, [Eastwood] finds an angry grace and pathos more satisfying than anything else in this grooved fastball of a movie.__The good news is that this daddy/daughter reconciliation story connects with the ball. The not-so-good: It's a blooper.
A film packaged as pure product, aiming to snare the combined markets for loudmouth comics, sci-fi action and, er, Richard Ayoade - who, however seemingly misplaced, is the freshest thing here.__It's a mash-up of blah buddy comedy and gross-out CGI monster splatter, with nary a laugh to be had.__The Watch is a predictable and lazy comedy wrapped around a penis joke occasionally enlivened with some funny lines.__What should have been at least Ghostbusters lite ends up sliming audiences with sloppy seconds.__"The Watch" takes the same ethos of male bonding, obsession with sex and sardonic violence that has proved so profitable in recent years on yet another summer spin.__Improvisation is definitely The Watch-word, with Vaughn and Hill in particular winging just about every line they speak - most of them filthy, few of them funny.__For hang time with the guys, you could do worse than "The Watch."__Really, wait for it on cable. At least then you'll be able to change the channel.__The "action" scenes come across as brief, noisy periods of rest from the lame comedy, which counts for something, if not quite what the filmmakers intended.__Much of the action takes place after hours in the Costco managed by Stiller's character, but the laughs are not available in bulk.__Director Akiva Schaffer, excellent when directing and co-writing SNL Digital Shorts, has his hands full just trying to attach one ill-fitting scene to another, with little opportunity to establish a coherent style or, for that matter, a coherent shot list.__We're talking about a dozen or so taken-by-surprise, spontaneous and genuine "Ha!" moments. And always one "ha," never two.__Directed by Akiva Schaffer from a screenplay by Jared Stern, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the movie clumsily juggles two loosely connected concepts.__Though many of the jokes land, some of them feel like a game of penis-related Mad Libs.__Imagine Attack the Block, only set in America. With a mostly middle-aged cast. And not funny. Or exciting.__A lowbrow, lame-brained mash-up of buddies-on-patrol comedy and sci-fi actioner.__Some of the phallic jokes work, others are really lame. Fortunately there are many other funny bits that have nothing to do with body parts that keep the laughs coming.__The Watch is a studio turd marinated in eau de skunk that stinks worse than week-old fish.__Though it's never transformational, it's mostly amusing. Which counts!__It has bodily humor that tilts so far out of funny they land in "clinically embarrassing." And it makes Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill yell like hyenas to keep things lurching along.
Tim Burton's most enjoyable movie in a long time.__Burton's best film since 1994's Ed Wood or even 1990's Edward Scissorhands.__This is a Tim Burton film with something to say. And that's a rare and precious thing.__The stop-motion animation - a favorite tool of Burton's - is given loving attention, and the character design is full of terrific touches, such as the hulking flat-topped schoolmate who looks a bit like a certain man-made monster.__The best thing about an animated monster movie with this much heart is: It's alive. In the best possible way.__This 3-D, black-and-white "family" comedy is the year's most inventive, endearing animated feature.__Designed to appeal to both discriminating adults and older kids, the gorgeous, black-and-white stop-motion film is a fresh, clever and affectionate love letter to classic horror movies.__The most Tim Burton-y of the director's films, and not just because it contains a vast catalog of references to his own movies - everything from "Edward Scissorhands'' to the underrated 1989 "Batman.''__"Frankenweenie" may just be a wacky horror cartoon, but it's an awfully good wacky horror cartoon. Frighteningly good, you might say.__It's a quintessential Burton film, but also more Disney than a lot of Disney films.__A 3-D, black-and-white, stop-motion animated film, it's a one-man blow for cinematic biodiversity.__The overall effect is great cinema, good fun, a visual feast for pie-eyed Burton fans - and a terrifically warped reminder of just how freaky a PG film can be.__Some audiences might feel that "Frankenweenie" is creaky, but those on the same wavelength as Burton will gratefully declare it's alive.__While "Frankenweenie" is fun, it is not nearly strange or original enough to join the undead, monstrous ranks of the classics it adores.__There are so many horror auteurs Burton wants to thank that the film is absolutely bursting at the seams with knowing nods.__Burton half succeeds in making this revamped Frankenweenie its own distinctive creature, pieced together from the essential bits of the 29-minute original. But he just doesn't know when to stop, and his overgrown creation gets the better of him.__Frankenweenie is the apotheosis of goth director Tim Burton's oeuvre: artistic yet sterile, incredibly meticulous and totally misbegotten.__The story brims with self-parody, social satire, horror, nostalgia, wit and emotional insight, with Burton keeping all the plates spinning.__Only Tim Burton could envision this Frankenstein-inspired tale, and it's a honey, a dark and dazzling spellbinder that scares up laughs and surprising emotion.__"Frankenweenie" is a mere 87 minutes long, which turns out to be just the right length; there's not enough time for Burton to go off the rails as he does in so many of his films.
__It's equal parts 'Flashdance,' 'Burlesque' and 'Lambada', all parts ludicrous - but we aren't here for the story any more than we watch Bela Tarr for the salsa numbers.__There's too much color and energy and frenzy in this movie to discount it entirely, but it has a disconcerting tendency to undercut its best notions with some singularly awful moves.__With the most wooden leads of the series to date - an MMA fighter and a "So You Think You Can Dance" alum - the drama between the dancing has never felt more interminable.__"Step Up: You've Seen All This Before" would be more accurate, but Summit Entertainment's marketing department knows that wouldn't help sell tickets.__Delivers plenty of spectacular fancy footwork in what is otherwise a flat-footed fantasy.__While dance purists won't be impressed by the energetic and athletic choreography -- the dancers have clearly learned routines but not necessarily technique -- date-movie audiences will likely want to go out dancing afterward themselves, and that's fun.__The choreography is solid throughout, but director Scott Speer gets in his own way every time, relentlessly shifting camera angles to close-ups and reaction shots when he should be letting us witness the spectacle.__There isn't a franchise around that matches the kids' moves in the Step Up series. We just need a better reason to dance along.__No one goes to a "Step Up" movie for the plot or the romance. Only the dancing matters here.__Busby Berkeley would have approved of the hijinks director Scott Speer gets up to with his 3D cameras__It seems only fair to start with the one thing that's right with it: It's not dead. It should be, but it's not.__Though the location-specific choreography looks like it could be impressive, the film's frantic cutting style makes it difficult to simply enjoy bodies moving in space.__Will the next "Step Up" tackle the cutting-edge trend of planking?__Contrary to its message, it will not change the world. But the dancing will make you sit up and take notice.__The plot is pure boilerplate, yet the draw of this franchise has always been its fancy footwork, and the movie's stuttering, herky-jerky spectacles of impassioned movement are pretty extraordinary.__Not as cringe-worthy as you would expect from the fourth "Step Up" installment.__Sadly, somewhere between a split and a fist pump, Revolution fell flat, and I found myself wishing for Magic Mike in 3-D.__Despite their infectious energy and some mind-blowing moves, there's a chaotic formlessness to even the best of these set pieces__She's a rich daddy's girl! He's from the wrong side of the tracks! They bridge their socio-economic gap through the power of dance! Rinse, repeat.
A ridiculously redemptive finale negates almost all of the preceding dramatic tension and resurrects a cloying Richard Marx chestnut to boot.__Whose life, Wesley asks in the movie's narration, is he living? Judging from all the sterile office and apartment space and his mile-long face, I'd say Bruce Willis's in "The Sixth Sense.''__There aren't a lot of laughs in "Good Deeds," and it could have used more of them.__An otherwise unremarkable pic that takes what feels like a very long time to unwind a drearily predictable storyline.__Good Deeds honors goodness, which isn't at all a bad thing, and it's not without moments of genuine feeling. But by the film's end, after watching a seemingly infinite number of dour close-ups of sober self-evaluation, I felt bludgeoned.__Good Deeds, with its Frank Capra-gone-Good Will Hunting title, is lucky to have Thandie Newton, easily the most gifted actress ever to have starred in a Tyler Perry movie.__Far more interesting in the context of his filmography than it is to actually watch.__Every Perry movie has its highs and lows. This time, the highs are a little higher, and the lows not quite so low.__By Perry's standards, it's a high-toned production, which means it doesn't look as if were shot during downtime on a soap-opera set, but it's still as blurry as a fifth-generation copy.__Where's Madea when you need her?__Good Deeds is more proof that Perry is a crude dramatist.__A melodramatic slog riddled with laughable dialogue that wouldn't hold a made-for-TV-movie audience past the first commercial break.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Shockingly uneventful, this horror film marks time until dropping its big, dumb reveal.__A choppily edited, poorly timed mess with little continuity, overloaded with aural shocks in a desperate attempt to compensate for its minimal suspense.__Tonderai steers the story cleanly around its queasy hairpin turns, perversely toying with one of pop cinema's most cherished cliches: the audience's inculcated desire to side with the underdog.__There are one or two clever plot twists that are subsequently followed up by a cavalcade of ridiculous, credibility-stretching ones.__What could be so bad about a new Jennifer Lawrence movie that its distributor opts to keep it away from critics and release it with minimal ad support? Please, allow "House at the End of the Street" to answer that question.__This is the rare horror film so bad you almost wish it had turned into a good old connect-the-gory-dots slasher movie. The only mystery at work is how Lawrence's agent ever let her sign on.__Goes flat and generic, substituting jump-scares and visual twitchiness for the psychological complexity that might have sold the horror.__Originality, or lack thereof, isn't really the movie's problem. Execution is.__A schlockly spin on the girl-in-jeopardy genre.__Feisty girl + troubled young man + house full of ugly secrets = hackneyed horror movie you've seen a hundred times before, even if Jennifer Lawrence keeps it watchable.__Bland, bloodless babysitter bait.__A thriller with a twisted ending that feels clumsy, laboured and unconvincing throughout.__Lawrence is perfectly in character yet somehow outside it too, floating above Elissa and the weak movie alike.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The action is beautifully staged, delightful, and exciting.__The filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel. They needn't hurry. Whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried.__To paraphrase a certain man with a certain luxuriant beard, it's only impossible to enjoy if you stop to think about it.__Pirates are right up there with vampires, werewolves and people saying "LOL" out loud on the list of Played-Out Pop Culture Phenomena, but leave it to Aardman Animation to find the remaining reservoirs of fun in a bunch of seafaring scalawags.__This pirate tale is a misguided adventure that doesn't fully set sail.__Designed to please all generations of irreverent humour-lovers, The Pirates! Band of Misfits may not be heart-warming (it is about nasty, scurvy pirates!) but it's breezy rollicking fun.__You may laugh more than the child who brought you to "The Pirates! Band of Misfits," a subtly screwball animated comedy with a distinctively British wit.__The joyfully silly gags in "Pirates!" often feel old-fashioned in a "Looney Tunes"-esque way...__It makes for an experience that, while geared toward younger, more fidgety audiences, has enough humor to keep Mom and Dad from falling asleep.__Sure-footed, witty and zany fun.__That the film happens to be in 3-D, with digitized settings and backgrounds, doesn't detract from the timeworn charm of watching blob-like characters lurch erratically through harebrained comic pratfalls.__Another deliriously silly stop-motion animation delight from Aardman, filled with giddy pleasures and witty details.__The movie ... is a cheerful entertainment, suitable for kids and parents of the brighter stripe. It's just not Nick Park great.__Pirates is just what audiences have come to expect from Aardman: smart, adventure-driven comedy with all-ages appeal and an affinity for clever sight gags.__The movie looks meticulously crafted, of course, and is consistently, drily amusing.__A clever piece of business that is a complete pleasure to experience.__This splashy sendup is a dead man's chest of laughs.__The result is indeed a rollicking good time, even if Aardman's ambitions don't quite dazzle as usual.__A curiosity cabinet of visual pleasures but so breezy and lightly funny that you may not realize at first how good it is. (You're too busy grinning.)__Purists can rest easy. This marriage doesn't scupper Aardman's classic clay-based animated heritage and the script is still filled with the kind of dry laughs only the Brits can conjure up, with many of the jokes of the visual variety.
[A] mostly sweet-natured rehash of 'Sister Act 2' by way of 'Glee'...__"Joyful Noise" is a sort of Wal-Mart movie, not exactly trendsetting but a decent enough offering for the heartland.__You'll find yourself rolling your eyes, but you'll have more fun if you try to roll them in time with the rollicking numbers.__Has the good fortune of being acted with enthusiasm by a very appealing cast, or else it would be completely unbearable instead of just mundane.__This movie is a cloying, over-the-top, cheesy sing-a-long that makes "Glee" seem subtle.__[It] bears almost all the liabilities one gets from current studio product, including bloating.__Lots of talented young singers decorate the scenery, notably Jeremy Jordan who has vocal and acting chops that shine even in this bucket of Glee Goes Gospel cornpone.__It wants to be a charming, down-home good time, but it struggles to hit the right notes.__Much worse things could happen to a movie than to have these two full-figured gals hold forth. Parton's willing and able to despense the Southernisms. Latifah's fierce when she needs to be.__My, is there corn. But you'd have to be holding on very tightly to a bad mood to walk away from this meal with a frown.__An unholy mess.__Whenever the characters open their mouths to sing, "Joyful Noise" rocks and swings with spirit to spare.__Nothing more than uninspired mushiness.__Despite some mawkish dialogue, there's something to be said for leaving the theater with a smile. Can I get an amen?__Latifah, a formidable actress who's almost always better than her movies, easily dominates this...__"Joyful Noise" follows the book for sprightly musicals and small-town quirk.__If it weren't for those musical numbers, Joyful Noise would be a slog. More singing and less talking would have made it better still.__It's hard to enjoy the movie's charms when writer-director Todd Graff keeps trying to shove them down your throat.__Joyful Noise works best when the screen is filled with music, or when stars Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah are slinging spirited one-liners at each other.__A lower echelon of musical comedy hell (or heaven, if you love the hoariest musical comedy cliches).
Those hungering for rare footage of our cousins playing and foraging, fighting or fleeing are in for a number of treats.__Of course, if you're a fan of old-school Disney True-Life Adventure tales like "Joker: The Amiable Ocelot," then you're used to this sort of sanitizing of the world's rougher edges.__Walt Disney himself couldn't have scripted "Chimpanzee" any better.__Resurrects some of the worst traits of the studio's True-Life Adventures series of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, dubiously shaping some amazing footage with cornball narration that relentlessly anthropomorphizes its simian subjects.__It's really a wonder of nature, a reminder of how we are bound to other species and how valuable and special and downright magical their lives are. It may be a bit corny at times, but it's also downright enlightening.__One wonders whether more than a few viewers won't want to take home a baby chimp after seeing the film.__We don't see footage of different chimps and have to pretend it's the same; this is one fellow, from one clan, trying to survive.__Produced in association with the Jane Goodall Institute, "Chimpanzee" is an eye-opening primer in cross-species similarity.__Unfortunately, when so many strings have been pulled along the way, Oscar's triumph feels contrived for dramatic impact, even though it really happened.__The stunning and mostly uncompromising visuals more than compensate for the frequent corny turns of phrase.__[It] might as well be called "Simply Irresistible," because thanks to the mischievous monkeyshines of a baby chimp named Oscar, it comes pretty close.__It's unfortunate that the filmmakers juxtapose those striking visuals with a warlike anthropomorphizing element.__To experience "Chimpanzee," the latest piece of gorgeously shot pablum from Disneynature, is to endure an orgy of cuteness pasted over some of the most asinine narration ever to ruin a wildlife movie.__Combines astonishingly vivid and intimate footage of animal life with narration that sometimes crosses the line between accessible and intrusive.__Perhaps the best strategy for enjoying the movie would be to a) leave sensitive tykes at home and b) bring a portable music player to provide an alternative soundtrack.__With its emphasis on entertainment rather than edification, the film occupies a warm-and-fuzzy middle ground between "The Jungle Book" and Animal Planet.__All audiences stand to be charmed except those grouches who prefer their animals to be valued as animals rather than as furry little people.__It has plenty of charm and is filled with astonishingly intimate footage worth seeing on the big screen but is sketchy on details and dumbed down by cutsy, anthropomorphizing narration.__Fothergill and Linfield really do capture some awesome footage of the chimpanzees in the wild. Who knew watching them crack nuts with sticks and rocks could be so entertaining? Or use a stick to eat ants?__It's never less than remarkable to lay eyes upon. But it feels more ... contrived.
This is a watchable but rather drab romcom which relies too often on Apatow-school cliche.__An exemplary modern romantic comedy, personal and symbolic, goofy and substantial, tightly imagined yet loosely strung, wise in bewilderment.__Like Apatow's "Funny People," the film is an intentional hybrid: half gag comedy, half open-ended exploration of everything that can go wrong -- and occasionally right -- between two people whom nature, if not society, means to be together.__A charming, funny, reactionary mating comedy from the Judd Apatow factory...__A fun, entertaining picture, and another credit to Segel's rising career as a writer and star.__[It] feels poignant and real in a way few raunch comedies are.__Blunt has never been more relaxed, and she and Segel have a believably warm chemistry.__Some of the comedic material provokes laughter and some doesn't, but nearly all of it feels wrong. It's as if the jokes have been shoehorned into the movie because it was deemed too dramatic.__Sometimes uneven and sometimes beyond gross, but more often it's funny, smart and different.__What keeps the film from seeming shrill is that Tom and Violet, despite everything, genuinely love each other, and their careers dilemma is not played for easy laughs.__It makes you laugh and eagerly wish for a happy ending without any preachy soul-searching.__Feels more like the raw feed than the final edit, and seems to run as long as the time span promised in the title.__"The Five-Year Engagement" becomes two things: an accurate reflection of a new generation of postponement-prone 30-somethings, and a rather uninteresting story.__"The Five-Year Engagement" doesn't always work - some of the supporting characters' storylines feel clipped, and the improvised bits could afford to be tightened - but the trip to the altar pays off.__This seems like another breakthrough for Blunt, who demonstrates an ample gift for physical comedy. She and Segel make an inspired team.__I liked "The Five-Year Engagement," and then I didn't, and then I did - which seems just about right for a movie dedicated to examining how even the purest affections can be fatally derailed.__At best, "The Five-Year Engagement" is very well played by its leads and supporting characters. You can't go wrong with Segel, Blunt, Pratt and Brie, the latter two TV stars who are movie-ready.__The movie is a precision instrument with no parts jammed together, just everything smooth and functioning.__This story of a promising sous chef who sacrifices his career in San Francisco to follow his girlfriend to Ann Arbor delivers a steady stream of character laughs, along with a rigidly formulaic plot.__It's too bad The Five-Year Engagement's overlong, conventional last third squanders the goodwill built up in that sharply observed middle section.
Whatever your age, even if life is an ocean made up of many drops, you may resolve that life is too short for this errant nonsense.__A film which piles on the action, the romance, the philosophical inquiry and the silly accents until the viewer is left punch-drunk and reeling. Seriously, what's not to love?__They key to successfully absorbing the movie may be in not trying to overthink what's on screen.__An eminently peculiar mismatch of substance and form, like a Hallmark card written by David Foster Wallace.__The result is maddening, exasperating, occasionally exhilarating -- and mostly boring.__For all the spectacular settings and visionary designs, Cloud Atlas left me feeling disconnected__Felicitous moments can't break through the dark nebula of self-importance around Cloud Atlas ...__Sumptuous visuals and audacious acting, but the quasi-profound message of cosmic connectedness isn't worth all the trouble.__Exciting, exhausting and energizing, a brazen film that leaves somber cinema seeming too passive for its own good. This is a movie as big as life itself.__"Cloud Atlas" deserves praise if only for not being the baggy, pretentious disaster it could have been in other hands.__he best thing about Cloud Atlas is that it could, and should, turn into a properly divisive film... but one has to ask: does it allow for immersion? Even as we applaud the dramatic machinery, are we being kept emotionally at bay?__It will aid your experience of the swirling, sweeping dramatic adventure Cloud Atlas, if you embrace the idea of being a little bit lost.__Enormous in length and scope, a film whose purpose doesn't even begin to come into focus until two hours in.__The cumulative effect is one of spectacle over substance.__It's a polarizing, ambitious, sometimes beautiful and occasionally maddening epic.__Galumphing and heavy-handed, its rare flights of lyricism stranded between long stretches of outright risibility.__It's funny, violent and prodigiously romantic; it has immense heart and more gorgeous cinematic moments than I can describe.__It plays like a gargantuan trailer for a movie still to be made (one that, given the same ratio, would be 86 hours long).__Finally, what sinks "Cloud Atlas" is not the largeness of its ambitions but the lack of skill it displays in terms of writing, directing and acting.__Did you hear the one about the Zen master who walks up to a hot dog cart, scans the menu, and asks the vendor to "make me one with everything"?
An ungainly mix of flat-footed gumshoeing and strained attempts at hilarity, all delivered with an unconvincing Joizy vibe.__The movie has the by-the-numbers efficiency of a decent TV series, and about as much flavor.__There have been notable exceptions, but Heigl tends to imbue her characters with an off-putting mix of insecurity and abrasiveness. This film is a prime example.__I guess I can't call the movie sexist as it was largely produced, directed and written by women. So I'll settle for calling it dull, corny and amateurish instead.__There is action of a sort -- a car blows up, shots are fired -- and what might pass for witty, sexy banter to someone who once overheard a conversation about an episode of Moonlighting.__Heigl's comic timing is solid, and she knows her limitations well enough, but there's a hollowness at the movie's center, right where Heigl's heart should be.__Imagine an Elmore Leonard movie scripted by a bad Nora Ephron imitator, and you'll have an idea of how dead-in-the-Jersey-water it is.__Punitively dull.__Everything in One for the Money rings cringingly false.__Tedious and tonally inept.__Janet Evanovich's best-selling Stephanie Plum series deserved better than this woefully executed, stillborn attempt at a franchise.__Heigl, sporting tousled brunette locks, gives a busy, unconvincing performance.__One for the Money is tepidly glib throughout. Even violent murders are followed by wisecracks or another prurient opportunity to ogle Heigl's behind and cleavage.__To compare this mess to a sitcom would be an insult to sitcoms.__None__None__None__None__None__None
[Perry] has rarely been less convincing than when locking and loading from his home arsenal or dangling from a decaying Detroit edifice.__Alex Cross is coarse, punishing, and, in all the ways that matter, conscienceless ...__So cloddish, slapdash, gracelessly written, and visually fugly that it's difficult to distinguish Perry's limitations in the role from those of the whole unpleasant enterprise.__A strong candidate for dumbest film of the year ...__For a franchise with an off-the-charts nuanced thinker as its protagonist, Alex Cross isn't very smart.__Perry's supposed to be its center. And as an actor - certainly as a movie star - he's absolutely nowhere to be found.__Tyler Perry finds it easier to step out of Madea's dress than into Morgan Freeman's shoes in the thriller Alex Cross, a trite attempt at franchise building.__Stripped down to his undershirt or brandishing an assault rifle, Perry looks both incongruous and ridiculous - an icon out of water.__It feels almost cruel to laugh at such a blindly stumbling, dunderheaded action-thriller, but you won't be able to help it.__There's still a marketplace for a smart, well-crafted cat-and-mouse thriller. But "Alex Cross" isn't it.__Cohen squanders a surprisingly recognizable cast on a half-baked plot adapted from James Patterson's series of novels.__The first thing you'll want to know about "Alex Cross" is: Can Tyler Perry carry it off? The answer is: Sort of, but not really.__"Alex Cross" is a good example of what a seriously talented director can do with a heaping pile of garbage.__The opening scene of "Alex Cross" serves notice of what's to come by taking us down into a Detroit sewer.__A grim, dispiritingly stupid waste of time, energy, money and talent ...__[Cross] has a really bad temper, really big guns and really bad dialogue. He will use all of them excessively if pushed.__As goofy as it is gruesome.__From its cliche opening -- an irrelevant gun battle and chase -- to its derivative climax, this is a film with decades of dust on it.__If I hadn't had to stay awake, I would have slept though the whole thing. At home.__Perry is a likable presence, but the movie around him is such a mess that he never gets to prove his potential.
We're left with zero sense of what she's really like as a granddaughter, sister, boss, or friend.__Although there are moments when the filmmakers' fingerprints are nearly visible on the manipulated putty of an audience, the scenes aren't enough to break the fruit-flavored spell.__"Part of Me" is more electronic press kit than fly-on-the-wall documentary.__Just like it says, "Part of Me" is one aspect of Perry, but her fans may leave the movie wanting more.__What is worth seeing - and shelling out the 3-D premium for - is Perry's eye-popping showmanship.__I gained respect for Perry, her work ethic and personal rediscovery.__I'm willing to believe Perry is everything "Part of Me" says she is: kind, smart, talented, hardworking, deserving of success. I just wish the movie trusted me to decide for myself.__Part of Me works hard to prove it's more than a glorified infomercial, and one reason it is more is that Perry has a startling story to tell.__Surely there are more interesting subjects, but Perry manages to pull it off here, coming off completely likable and real, never insufferable and fake.__[It] goes a bit beyond the usual music documentaries, which rarely document anything beyond how beloved their stars are.__Ever the professional, the pop star has surrounded herself with people who know how to make a tour work - but none of them seem well-equipped to give a heartbroken 27-year-old girl a much needed hug.__I'm not sure what I was expecting from "Katy Perry: Part of Me," but I know it wasn't this: a pleasant surprise.__You realize the main drama of the movie - and Perry's career - is not that she has any special artistic talent, but rather the drive to take on an insane workload and see it through to the bitter end.__Any self-produced documentary about oneself is bound to be a propaganda film, but "Katy Perry: Part of Me" is a good one, and a persuasive one.__It's difficult to assess the authenticity of Perry's big-screen portrait, shaped by handlers, friends, family and gushing Katy Kats. But her zeal, geeky enthusiasm and generous spirit feel genuine.__As one record executive put it, for too long the industry tried to make Katy Perry into something or someone else. The secret, which "Part of Me" captures quite nicely, was to just let her be.__There's nothing new or radical in those ideals - learning to accept yourself, not taking life too seriously - but they are messages that resonate with her young fans, female and male, and that's not at all a bad thing.__"Part of Me" succeeds because it's not afraid to let its big star be vulnerable.__"Part of Me" will never be mistaken for "The Red Shoes" (though Ms. Perry has some of those, as well as every other color), but her negotiation of the painfully competing demands of stardom and marriage is undeniably poignant.__Part Of Me often feels like the offspring of E! True Hollywood Story and an infomercial for Katy Perry Inc.
Sparkle shamelessly piles on the cliches, but it's an entertaining ride throughout.__Noteworthy only for featuring Whitney Houston's last screen appearance.__Sparkle is an assembly of parts and pieces from other, better movies - an overly familiar jumble of cliches mashed together.__"Sparkle" isn't blindingly original but it delivers solid entertainment, and despite the cliches I was never for a moment bored.__Anyone who has seen Dream Girls, What's Love Got To Do With It? or even The Doors will find themselves in familiar (if inferior) territory here ...__It's nice that "Sparkle" honors the memory of Motown's heyday; if only it could have lived up to those standards.__Often seems like a flat, straightforward Supremes biopic in its adherence to seemingly pointless scenes and exposition.__"Sparkle" trafficks in the same gorgeous Motown style -- sonic and visual -- that made the original film, and "Dreamgirls" after it, such delectable fun.__Generally improves on the source material as much as possible while still succumbing to some of the same hoary showbiz beats.__"Sparkle" was made by smart people who built on their star's strengths, accounted for her weaknesses and didn't lean on her to carry the whole picture.__If the film is a sudsy show-business Cinderella story in which Emma's youngest daughter, Sparkle (Jordin Sparks), ascends to glory, Houston's presence makes it a cautionary tale.__The melodramatic story is familiar, though the talented cast makes the most of rather tired material.__Houston's performance proves that this could have been the first step not merely in a comeback but in a major re-invention. She had the instincts of a superb character actress.__Tika Sumpter [is] the best actress of the three ...__Where the original Sparkle was a ghetto melodrama with equal parts mob and music, the Akils have refashioned it into a saga of family rupture and reconciliation.__A bright and breezy musical that puts a breath of spring in this clammy late-summer season.__It's a fun, sudsy tale of show-biz ups and downs, with an endearing Sparks in the title role as one of three singing siblings in Motown-era Detroit.__As the insecure, innocent ingenue, Sparks, 22, seems a bit tentative at first. But like her character, she gains her footing.__Whitney Houston deserved better than to go out onscreen with this botch job remake of a 1976 soap opera that never deserved another thought.__The performances through "Sparkle" are strong - Sparks has a gentle, sweet little-sister quality that draws you to her, nicely balanced by Ejogo's smoldering fire - and the colorful 1960s costumes (by Ruth E. Carter) and elaborate hairstyles are a kick.
Just a few spokes short of a wheel, guys.__An unpretentious throwback to the kind of action movie that had no need of superheroes, Premium Rush is hardly a classic but fun up to a point.__Premium Rush is that rare bird: a chase picture that's just a chase picture - and a dandy one.__A blast.__The whole film sizzles with urban aggression.__Premium Rush isn't mindless mayhem, a thriller for teenage boys bursting with hormonal bloodlust. Koepp's film has a brain...__The movie speeds along crisply, providing just enough exposition to lend a few pounds of emotional weight without bogging down the breakneck pace.__I do have an abiding fondness for compact and coherent action movies, and this is surely one.__Throwing "premium" into the title may be overselling such a trifling entertainment. But for the cinematically discounted days of late summer, it's a perfectly diverting little ride.__It's a good thing that adrenaline tends to short-circuit logical thinking; the plot is mostly nonsensical, but you'll be too thrilled by the literal twists and turns to care much.__Premium Rush earns its place as end-of-the-summer escapism, but I can't say that it's more than a well-done formula flick.__Undeniably, the word "action" does apply, but only as it falls between "class" and "suit."__"Premium Rush" is both the title of this movie and its clever if less than subtle promise to summer audiences -- which it mostly delivers ...__No brakes indeed.__This is supposed to be a life-and-death chase movie, not two friends messing around.__Breezy and entertaining, if imperfect ...__Sit back and enjoy it as a summer jolt of pure adrenaline.__Like the lithe and maligned carriers weaving their way through Big Apple traffic, "Premium Rush" is a thin, brash, sinewy thing built entirely for speed.__The contrived tale is filled with plot holes, but the story takes a back seat to the chase-filled, daredevil action.__Premium Rush is just a fun ride.
______By-the-book dialogue and lame performances do the film no favours but, hey, worse things happen at sea.__There's something refreshing about a kids' movie that manages to get through its entire length without a poop joke.__If you're looking for a passable film to take the kids to this weekend, Miracle offers a smart enough take on its feel-good plot to keep adult viewers tuned in.__"Big Miracle" might be subtitled, "How Hollywood Turned a Real Story Into Bogus Fiction."__Big Miracle is not one of those whale tales that leaves the audience blubbering, but it's open to the allure of the imposing creatures, which resemble long boulders that have come to life.__"Big Miracle" shouldn't really work, but it does.__Cold War-era bonding over whales? It would sound utterly absurd if it weren't based on fact. And that's part of what makes this movie fun for adults.__Given the abundance of one-dimensional human portrayals, it becomes apparent that a documentary on the subject might have been more powerful.__"Big Miracle" gets off to a shaky start, but once revved up, it becomes an involving work-against-the-clock-and-the-odds action movie.__It is a whale of a comic tale, if also one overly crowded with characters and incidents.__Instead of this being a story of a bunch of lovely people doing a lovely thing, it's rather the story of average people who become much better people as a result of doing a lovely thing, even though some start out doing it for less than noble reasons.__There may not be a second of say, Whale Rider's lyricism (that's still the best whale movie out there), but this energetic family movie is less insipid than it looks.__It's amazing a movie hasn't been made about these Reagan-era events before now. But the enjoyable "Big Miracle" offers perspective, balancing sentiment with healthy skepticism about human motivations.__It needs only to entertain. And that it does thoroughly, leaving us both charmed and enriched without feeling very preached at. Praise be.__The longer Big Miracle goes on, the more it settles for an amiable communitarianism chased down by a PG group-hug finale.__The genuinely sweet nature of this sometimes clunky movie is mixed with a little sass, and wins you over.__If you think it's absolutely not your kind of thing, you might be surprised.
The fresh and simple story will win its share of young fans, though it lacks the disturbing adult elements might have attracted older audiences.__[The film] pulses with feeling for childhood and nature and develops a surprising amount of suspense considering it takes place around a single suburban home.__The Secret World of Arrietty is a marvelously captivating animated feature about very tiny people and the full-scale world they inhabit.__Yonebayashi gives Arrietty an excellent sense of balance, with the adventure aspects of the story, which feel legitimately dangerous providing well-paced contrast the film's more placid moments.__It's an enjoyable and attractive-looking film, but a little of that "Speed Racer" energy wouldn't have been such a bad thing.__The visual details are inventive, and the animation - particularly the colors - is lovely.__"The Secret World of Arrietty" proves that imagination still matters amid all the clamor.__"The Secret World of Arrietty'' is a feast for the eyes that will engage the entire family.__The Secret World of Arrietty is sweet fun, an astute match of exquisite style and small content.__This gorgeous little movie is sure to be beloved by your little people, who may discover what it means to find a magical beauty in the things we can't altogether see.__"The Secret World of Arrietty" is a sweet world indeed.__With its lush colors, imaginative view of ordinary objects and meticulously crafted miniature civilization, it transports viewers to an enchanting alternate storybook reality.__Whether it's an expansive view of a sun-dappled meadow or a close-up of our diminutive heroine making her way across a lawn while hiding under a leaf, the Ghibli artists show us the world the way Matisse once painted it.__What unfolds is part adventure, part fairy tale, part star-crossed romance (she fits in his palm; can it get more doomed?). And the overall sum is enchantment.__Studio Ghibli and Arrietty have a way of taking you where you may not expect, whether you're scrambling through rooms as large as canyons or clambering into the safety of an outstretched hand, a simple gesture that says it all.__Beautiful, gentle and pure - but not without elements of genuine menace - it will make believers out of adults and children alike.__When Shawn, a sickly boy sent to live in the house before he has heart surgery, sees Arrietty, does he squash her like a bug? Dear reader, he is enchanted. As are we.__The film flatters young moviegoers' awareness of deeper matters while delivering just enough enchantment to beguile both them and their parents.__Ghibli films have a fantastic visual style and tone all their own, and first-time director Hiromasa Yonebayashi adapts Mary Norton's 1952 children's classic "The Borrowers" according to the house rules.__Like the ornate dollhouse that plays a part, "Arrietty" is lovely and well-appointed, but filled with only what you bring to it.
Alas, the movie tells a rather commonplace story.__The tsunami sequence is amazing, right up there with the one Clint Eastwood staged in Hereafter.__This is an unforgettable tribute to the determination of a very special family.__Naomi Watts gives one of her finest, most physically commanding turns.__Although it's ostensibly based on true events, The Impossible is not so much an inspiring tale of survival as it is an action flick.__While it may have been changed for the screen, this story of a family's ordeal is one from which any parent - any person, really - can't turn away.__This is a movie about the will to survive that physically acknowledges that will may not be enough.__An intense and compelling family melodrama from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona that sets a new standard for disaster cinema.__The Impossible is a nimbly acted drama that is at once a stellar visual achievement and a life-affirming story of familial love and courage.__Bayona uses pummeling subjective camera work and sound design to plunge viewers into the visceral terror of a universe gone mad.__Filmed with urgency and remarkably realistic special effects, "The Impossible" moves breathlessly through its story.__Perhaps Jaws and Open Water are the only other movie experiences that might engender more fear of the sea.__The tsunami comes to life more vividly than the characters, though Watts and young Holland, as her son, deliver strong performances.__In the hundred-year history of cinema, few thrillers have been as emotionally compelling as "The Impossible."__An earnest, extremely grueling, prodigiously crafted true-life drama that takes one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history and reduces it to a bad day at Club Med.__Say a prayer that The Impossible is the closest that you or I or anyone anywhere will get to the kind of catastrophe that makes this movie so harrowing, riveting -- and uneasily "uplifting."__In the end, Bayona's film is more frustrating and exhausting than inspiring.__A Saw movie for middlebrows.__A thrilling, if also punishing, tale of heroic endurance.__It is the kind of ode to the human spirit that you hope comes along, and not just during the holiday season.
Steven Soderbergh continues his occasional practice of using actors as found objects in his perfectly enjoyable formula action-thriller Haywire.__Mixed martial-arts star Carano puts major muscle, if minor acting ability, into this enjoyable action flick.__Carano is strong, fast, relentless. She's not much of an actress yet, but Soderbergh hides her weaknesses well...__There's a good deal of pleasure to be had in the clockwork precision of her hand-to-hand combat, which Soderbergh often shoots in profile to showcase her wall-climbing backflips.__Carano is nothing special as an actress - but darned if it matters when she's supported by a killer screenplay, a sharp cast, and Steven Soderbergh's unmistakably sly, mordant direction.__If "Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol" was a fancy top-shelf cocktail, this is Polish vodka, neat.__Like The Limey, also written by Haywire scribe Lem Dobbs, it's the kind of film that hearkens back to lean-and-mean revenge movies like Get Carter and Point Blank.__Though Carano isn't without a certain glowering charisma, her flat line readings and apparent discomfort with dialogue-heavy exchanges make her seem like a refugee from a different, schlockier movie...__Hand it to a wily indie veteran like Soderbergh to find a fresh twist to an old genre: The fighting isn't faked, but the acting is.__"Haywire" isn't a by-the-numbers action vehicle, it's a crafty thriller that works to undo beat-em-up cliches. In short, it's a livewire.__"Haywire" stays true to its low-rent B-movie principles, right down to the fast, strong and quietly competent heroine at its center.__'Haywire" is a wannabe, or rather a wanna-B, and that B is for "Bourne."__A vigorous spy thriller that consistently beckons the viewer to catch up with its narrative twists and turns. Bordering on convoluted, it works best when in combat mode.__"Haywire" is a lean, clean production, shot and edited by Soderbergh himself and utterly free of the incoherent action sequences and overcooked special effects that plague similarly scaled Hollywood pictures.__You don't love movies if the sight of Gina Carano beating up every guy in sight doesn't make you laugh, get happy and feel as if you're getting your money's worth.__As with any great action movie, what we're really here to see is the star showing off whatever skills got them on screen to begin with. And Haywire never disappoints.__"I don't wear the dress," explains Mallory Kane as she ponders the details of her next job. If she did, she'd probably strangle someone with it.__Watching Carano kick, spin, flip, choke, crack and crush the fiercest of foes - mostly men about twice her size - is thoroughly entertaining, highly amusing and frankly somewhat awe-inspiring.__The pleasure of this small, eccentric movie is the natural way Carano hurts people - by, say, walking partway up a wall and climbing onto a man's back, by sprinting toward the camera and flying into the human target standing in the foreground.__There's no deeper meaning to Steven Soderbergh's thriller than what meets the eye, yet its lustrous surfaces offer great and guilt-free pleasure.
This embraces its own lunacy readily enough, never aiming for anything more than the disposable thrills it delivers thick and fast.__The solution to "now what do we do for 103 minutes?" is to pile as many silly distractions into the running time as possible.__'Man on a Ledge' is our first legit contender for Best Worst movie of the year.__This is one of the few movies that, with its skyscraper action scenes, probably needed to be made in 3-D. As it is, though, it's barely in 2-D - and really, I'm not sure it needed to be made at all.__There's no escaping the sheer terror of a guy standing on a ledge that high up. "Man on a Ledge" delivers the sweats it intends to deliver.__When an action movie is as clumsy as "Man on a Ledge," it's begging to fall.__A clumsily made thriller with very few thrills.__[A] jumble of cop- and heist-movie cliches, dotted with appearances by actors you liked in something else...__Credibility takes a nose-dive long before its protagonist is separated from his perch.__Dumb, easy-to-swallow fun, more or less - the sort of movie that makes people say, "Well, that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."__Nobody should be this hard up for entertainment.__The film succumbs to cliches, grows convoluted and outlandish, and winds up dead on arrival.__"Man on a Ledge" doesn't aim high, but what it aims to do, it does.__A movie that doesn't realize that it should have been a comedy.__Oh, that the actual human dynamics of the unfolding story could have been as dramatic, as on the edge as that ledge.__En route to its kitchen-sink climax, "Man" manages to both amuse and provoke, to cleave to convention and promote ideas.__It sure is about a man on a ledge.__The film's descent into generic silliness feels more painful than it should for a late-January thriller.__The movie doesn't give an audience anything that makes sense. How does Harris smoke a cigar that appears to weigh more than he does? And whence is Worthington's accent?__This noirish thriller is as self-knowingly ludicrous and thoroughly enjoyable as Fritz Lang's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt or While the City Sleeps.
Once the annoying, two-dimensional characters start getting bumped off one by one, it's just a relief that the actors have stopped improvising their own banal dialogue.__Director Bradley Parker shakes his camera around a lot.__The real stars of the movie are the tired devices and plot points. They're famous, but they're as old as Betty White: The Guide Is Dead, The Van Won't Start, Her Shirt Has a Plunging Neckline, Don't Go in There.__Standard-issue genre accessories (dank stairways, flashlights, overcast skies, frosty windows) abound; shocks are mild and few.__You might actively root for their collective demise, if you could rouse yourself to care one way or the other. Go gallivanting in Chernobyl and you get what you pay for, nimrods.__First-time director Bradley Parker (working from a script co-written by Paranormal Activity creator Oren Peli) understands that suggesting is scarier than showing, and confusion generates more suspense than explanations do.__The lack of suspense and surprise in this dispiritingly rote film becomes its own form of contamination.__This is a standard-issue slasher movie without much slashing, substituting the Chernobyl-workers' ghost town of Pripyat for the likes of Friday the 13th's Camp Crystal Lake.__Well-paced direction from first-timer Bradley Parker layers on the tension and tosses in some worthy scares.__A basic monster movie that benefits greatly from its unique setting, Chernobyl Diaries again demonstrates Oren Peli's ability to wrest scares with minimal production values and a clever premise.__Scattered stretches of suspense and a few undeniably potent shocks are not enough to dissipate the sense of deja vu that prevails throughout Chernobyl Diaries.__It takes a good hour for one of the leads to suggest that "we need to be smart about this." You want to be smart? Don't take an unauthorized tour of a nuclear disaster site.__It's The Hills Have Eyes meets The Blair Witch Project, a flashlight tour through a stupid urban legend, with the unseemly authenticity only real devastation can provide.__Chernobyl Diaries is afflicted with a fatal flaw that damages many horror films: after a better-than-average setup and a promising first half, everything falls apart.__Avoid a boredom meltdown and give this formulaic scarefest a wide berth.__You'd never wish tragedy upon anyone, but at some point the characters become harder and harder to feel sorry for. Get a clue, people.__None__None__None__None
Perks seems like the work of a much more experienced director, maintaining fidelity to the source material without sacrificing any cinematic qualities, triggering genuine sentimentality and nostalgia through interaction between sound and image.__Sensitive teens and their older kin who pine for the '90s may want to take it for a spin on the dance floor.__Regardless of the viewer's proximity to his or her own high school experience, "Perks" seems to get it right, precisely because it's not about a specific time or place.__Watson holds her own with a character more annoying on paper than in reality, but it's the boys who most impress ...__It's an earnest indie about a troubled teen, Charlie (Logan Lerman), and his various troubled confederates -- but it does demonstrate that Watson can stand on her own.__High school can be hell, but Stephen Chbosky's engaging new film argues that anyone can get by with a little help from their friends.__Somehow, these imperfections fit. Somehow, "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" shouldn't be flawless.__This somewhat disjointed but refreshingly earnest movie ultimately establishes itself as a charmer.__This is clearly a labor of love that was nurtured and sculpted from the beginning. The result is a film that feels exhilarating, fragile, funny and real.__Well-soaked in the familiar brine of teen sensitivity.__Here's how to make sure your novel arrives on screen with its soul intact: adapt and direct it yourself.__As a director, Chbosky mirrors his central character's emotional state.__"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" finds an unexpectedly moving freshness in the old cliches by remaining attentive to the nuances of what happens within and between unhappy teenagers.__Stephen Chbosky's script is insightful about the exhilaration of soul-piercing first love, and the misery of being swept into a relationship with someone who's forceful, determined and utterly wrong for you.__Verbal play and smartass-ery weaves through Wallflower, but it's of the predictable variety rather than the wryly observant commentary we'd hope for, like when a bored teen drawls: "That works on so many levels."__This big-screen adaptation, written and directed by Chbosky, doesn't advance the source material, though it preserves the book's sensitive tone and affectionate characterizations.__All of my previous selves still survive somewhere inside of me, and my previous adolescent would have loved "The Perks of Being a Wallflower."__There is an honesty to "The Perks of Being a Wallflower," a genuineness of experience that makes the movie soar when it just as easily could have stumbled.__It is the remarkable Logan Lerman who negotiates his journey to Charlie's self-discovery with so much dignity and vulnerability that he steals every scene and carries the picture.__An occasionally funny, sometimes grim and all-in-all fairly adult look at privileged kids with sometimes awful lives, marred by abuse, drugs, depression, bullying and homophobia.
Trust me, this movie doesn't deliver on any level, high or low.__It's hard to remember a comedy so populated with good character bits.__You know you're in trouble when not even the improvised scenes and fluffed out-takes are funny.__A messy but occasionally very funny satirical comedy...__Rudd might not be the subtlest straight man in movies, but, as of this moment, he's the best.__Being taken under Apatow's wing may have been a big career break for writer-director David Wain, but this lacks the sharp personality of some of his earlier movies.__[The] shaggy but agreeable Wanderlust [is] worth the detour.__The film's problems go deeper than its outdated source of mockery and its narrative sloppiness. Worse than anything else, it's just not all that funny.__It takes guts to do a comedy this big without gross-out slapstick, and the writers and the actors are all in.__The leads are charming and although the plot twists are obvious, there are some funny scenes here.__A comedy that looks way better than it actually is set amidst the dreck of late winter releases...__Paul Rudd is the best friend a movie comedy can have.__Much of the movie feels pasted together; the story doesn't flow, it staggers forward.__As far as your humble correspondent knows, Wanderlust is the first mainstream movie ever to star a Floppy Prosthetic Penis.__"Wanderlust'' may lack the satiric edge of Albert Brooks' "Lost in America,'' but it does deliver more big laughs than most comedies these days.__A shambling mix of cheap laughs and genuinely funny set pieces from writer-director David Wain.__'Wanderlust' is equal parts fresh humor and stale jokes.__Though Wanderlust has a silly-funny premise and moments of inspired lunacy, it wanders aimlessly and runs some weak gags into the ground.__"Wanderlust" is an assembly line producing laughs.__For every few jokes that hit in this story about a recession-battered New York couple finding themselves on a Georgia commune, one sputters and dies.
__The occasional efficient action sequence means that 'Safe' never gets truly dull, but even Statham aficionados might feel short- changed by this one.__The thoroughly mediocre Safe provides little more than an excuse for Statham to do what Statham does better than anyone else: look stern while punishing bad guys. That's just not enough.__It's like another "Transporter'' installment trying to be something slightly more - and not quite delivering the goods.__Despite some impressively gritty street-level action, Safe plays it far too safe.__Yeah, "Safe" is a long way from perfect. But rented, in a few months, it'll go great with a six-pack and a hold-the-anchovies special.__It's hard to swallow Statham, who spent the Crank movies supercharging his last minutes of life, as a suicidal sad-sack, just as it's painful to see him yoked to a cute little girl in an obvious attempt to soften his image.__The plot first strains and then assassinates credulity, while Yakin's handling of the action/mayhem runs the gamut from the merely dull to what-the-hell's-going-on.__This whip-smart, brutally funny and gleefully nasty film is one of the year's best surprises.__There are zero surprises, but it looks good, moves well through a trim running time and wields its cliches with defiant aplomb.__Barrels through cliche after cliche and hurdles from borough to borough with a welcome abandon for logic, morality, and mortality alike.__Yakin's slick direction, marked by quick cuts, unstinting energy and a lack of sentimentality, makes the action scenes satisfying. But he's a better director than writer.__If only someone would offer this actor a project worthy of the full range of his talent.__None of this bears much or any resemblance to the real world, but the violence crunches, the editing snaps and the humorous one-liners pop at well-timed junctures.__The trouble with Safe is that you know where it's going every step of the way.__It's hard to imagine a die-hard action fan being disappointed.__Safe winds up being a B-movie with A-movie credentials, and all the more entertaining for it.__Yakin gives his star plenty of room to look mean, think fast, drive faster, punch, quip, mow down and charismatically bond with the most imperiled child character in screen memory.__It's not just laziness - although it's a fair cop - that prompts the observation that Safe is both the worst movie title and attitude for Jason Statham at this stage of his career.__Held on the shelf for a while until the marquee was (briefly) clear of action dramas, "Safe" arrives filled with bombast and sneers but barely any thrills.
Allen's creative revival comes to a juddering halt with a foursome of would-be amusing vignettes that barely muster a laugh between them.__Once upon a time, calling a movie "lesser Woody Allen" might be considered a slap in the face. Now, it's more-or-less expected.__Allen's story moves along quite wonderfully, primarily because of his nuanced casting.__Most of the characters are archetypes, yet Allen treats them with genuine affection and avoids the bitterness that's marred much of his recent work.__It's minor Woody, but it's still Woody.__Not great, but not grating.__Well, it's not "Midnight in Paris," but it's not "Whatever Works," either.__Alas, it's a love letter written on the fly, with brushstroke characters working their way through a cluster of sketchy, disconnected plotlines.__A charming but terribly self-indulgent trifle that's less than the sum of its many parts.__Fans of Allen's magnificent earlier work can only look at this effort and feel their own brand of Ozymandias melancholia.____In the end, Woody Allen and Rome go together like corned beef and gelato.__A film that sometimes comes off as an intersection of tangents, but it also gives rise to moments of joyous whimsy.__The best thing that can said about the picture is that it's a pleasant time-waster that also doubles as a travelogue for anyone interested in visiting Italy.__To Rome with Love desperately needs a script polish, as well as an entire third act.__Allen seems to be aiming for the precise intersection of art and commerce where sophistication is implied, but nothing that takes place is ever obscure or challenging or revelatory.__It's all rather sweet but instantly evanescent.__Somewhere in here is a real movie, but it's hard to find in all the mess (which, despite everything, is actually funny from time to time).__It's often inept, moment to moment.__Allen probably makes too many movies. This one's OK. He'll make more.
It's a mess; it's pretentious; it is thundery with dismay.__In the end it may not have the emotional uplift the Academy or a popular mainstream audience craves, but make no mistake, this is an enthralling drama about a peculiarly American restlessness, and the striving for insight and grace.__[A] challenging, psychologically fraught drama.__The actors' commitment to their roles is impressive, but it's tethered to a weightless, airless movie, a film so enamored of itself, the audience gets shut out.__The Master may go down as one of Paul Thomas Anderson's most compelling works for two simple reasons: Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman.__Where There Will Be Blood transmuted sullen earth into flame and launched it violently skyward, The Master is, as its opening shot advertises, a more fluid undertaking, a story of ebb and flow.__The Master is as confounding as it is magnificent.__[Phoenix and Hoffman] suggest duelling Brandos.__It's a surprisingly compassionate look at two people: A lost sheep and his shepherd.__Both Phoenix and Hoffman are on fire within their characters. If only they'd had some place to go.__"The Master" turns out to be more of a self-defeating whimper than the big, important bang it could have been.__Entrancing from first frame to last. The lights go down, they come up 137 minutes later, and you're left to ask yourself: What on earth did I just see?__A film that starts off seeming like the best of 2012 becomes a chore to sit through, and I suspect that few, even among this film's enthusiasts, will come to the end of the movie wishing there were more.__This portrait of 1950s America is like none you've ever seen, and it's unsettling - but the minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again.__The Master is a work that demands attention, and it satisfies on many levels - it is a film of intelligence and ambition, teeming with ideas, assembled with fearless artistry.__The film is interested in a cult of personality. Like Anderson's previous movie, "The Master" is a portrait of megalomania.__Anderson's audacious films defy facile interpretation. Having seen it just once, I'm not sure I grasp it.__For film fans who have lost faith in the transportive power of cinema, "The Master" will make you a believer.__Likely Oscar nominees both, Phoenix and Hoffman command the giant screen so completely it's hard to imagine anyone pulling it away from them.__Warts, wanderings, reiterations and all, this is a film destined to be processed in many different ways. And hallelujah to that.
Basically a well-researched but formulaic mystery centered on one of those nyah-nyah serial killers we've seen a thousand times.__It lingers intolerably on some inessential scenes, rushes through others, and fails to provide any motivation either for Poe's devoted (albeit fictional) love, or the film's archvillain.__Never commits to the kind of full-bore lunacy that might have made the film a campy pleasure.__The subject matter screams out for cleverness and depth, the sort of mind-bending twists and satisfying darkness that Poe himself would love. It finds them only in small doses.__Director James McTeigue has no feel for humor or terror, making what could have been a witty pastiche into another cheesy slice-and-dice horror flick.__It's 'Saw' meets 'Sherlock Holmes.' "__For a good hour or so, The Raven is gruesome, ludicrous fun. Then it's just ludicrous.__Until The Raven almost literally loses itself during a chase in the city sewers, it nicely balances its literary gamesmanship with a R-rated thriller's mandatory gross-out tableaux.__It's neither grand nor grisly enough to seriously satisfy Poe-ish cravings for murder, mystery and literary allusions.__The pervasive gore overpowers the few clumsy attempts at wit here...__It's good pulpy fun, with eye catching period trimmings, and Hungarian locations standing in ably for 19th century Maryland.__We immediately understand why Cusack is not known for playing men who lived before 1984.__The story has its moments, and yet there is something about this tale of a serial killer's patterning his crimes on Poe's most gruesome works that doesn't completely satisfy.__Edgar Allan Poe invented the detective story, so turning him into the heroic sleuth of a mystery thriller makes perfect sense.__Mr. Cusack works himself into a lather trying to reconcile the contradictory parts of an incoherent character. In, I am sorry to say, an incoherent movie.__A serial killer/Gothic drama/love story hybrid, it has some nicely mounted atmospheric scenes and strong acting from John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe.__If Edgar Allen Poe were alive today, working as a Hollywood screenwriter (God forbid), I suspect he'd be penning not the abysmal script for The Raven but something called The Fall of the House of Cusack.__A grimly preposterous serial-killer thriller set in 19th-century Baltimore, this riff on the final days of the author of "The Tell-Tale Heart" and other masterpieces of the macabre might qualify as literary desecration if it weren't so silly.__This wannabe Sherlockian thriller is like a night spent at Madame Tussauds, watching mannequins strangle other mannequins.__It's just a bore; quoth the raven, "Go see something else."
Lunatic, slipshod, absurdly violent, horribly acted, and borderline incomprehensible.__There's little happening here except slavish imitation and embarrassing hackwork.__If Iron Fists is sometimes badly made, it is refreshingly badly made.__No matter the medium, RZA is a world-builder who has conceptualized the contours of the rich, bloody, dense universe he created down to the most insignificant details.__The blood spurts, the knives shoot out, and the fists fly - but The Man with the Iron Fists never takes off.__"The Man With the Iron Fists" is the type of movie that feels like you are always coming in half-way through, even if you watch it from the beginning. As an exercise in genre, this is the highest compliment.__At 96 minutes it is exactly 93 1/2 minutes too long.__It may just be one of the best bad movies ever.__As erratically enjoyable as it is consistently ridiculous, the martial arts pastiche "The Man With the Iron Fists" is the latest evidence that the vogue for neo-exploitation cinema shows no sign of flagging.__As endearing as it is exhausting, The Man With the Iron Fists bears strong resemblance to a hyperactive puppy: sloppy, scatterbrained, manic and migraine-inducing, but possessing an earnest sense of excitement.__It's all sufficiently well done and amusing enough to satisfy the appetites of fans who mainline this sort of thing, but it also sports a concocted, second-hand feel common to this sort of throwback homage ...__Goes a long way in demonstrating that a bad movie with big names is still a bad movie. Just prettier.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
'Killing Them Softly' collapses under the crushing weight of the director's narcissism.__The anvils of obviousness rain down so hard and fast in New Zealand-born/Australian-based director Andrew Dominik's meditation on low-rent crime and American decline, that it might as well be a Coyote-Road Runner cartoon__Like its source material, the movie is stylish, profane, intelligent, and eminently diverting. But as much as it is a delight that Dominik has disinterred Higgins's work, it is a mild disappointment that the result is not more substantial.__Trading in pleasures of a deliberately rarefied sort, writer-director Andrew Dominik's talky, character-rich genre piece largely short-circuits thrills to sketch a grimly funny portrait of thugs taking care of business, in every rotten sense of the word.__Ultimately, as crafted as Killing Them Softly is, it's less satisfying than either The Sopranos or Goodfellas. Still, Dominik and his cast cruise some very mean streets indeed.__The dialogue is sharp and so are the performances. Andrew Dominik directed this neo-noir in a low-key comic style that's alternately gritty and fancy. The gritty stuff is best.__Dominik ... expertly captures the flavor of his Higgins source material.__A stylish, brutal affair that delivers grim atmosphere and punishing violence but loses impact in telegraphing its political punches.__If those cynical politics don't fit yours, you can also enjoy the film as simply a bit of stylishly shot, nicely acted, hardboiled noir.__Let's just call it DOA.__It isn't much of a movie. I might forgive the slow start if it weren't for the slow middle and slow end.__While the cast is consistently watchable and on-point, Dominik disappoints as both scenarist and filmmaker.__Pitt, entering his third decade of fame, continues to show how there was always a deadly serious actor in him all along.__There is not one moment in the film that doesn't represent the director's carefully considered thought, whether we're talking about acting values, camera placement, sound or style of presentation.__It's hard to deglamorize the criminal life when you can't resist showing a bullet leaving a gun barrel in stylized super-slow motion or scoring the anti-hero's first entrance to a Johnny Cash song.__It has a weird, buzzing, intense quality that has burrowed its way deep into my brain like some invasive sci-fi organism.__The writer-director becomes so intent on hammering home the parallels between economic decay, political disappointments and petty criminals, there is nothing soft, or subtle, about it. He should trust his audience more.__This is a deeply cynical movie, with not much to say but a lot to feel.__Languorous to the point of rambling, the story of double-crossing and vengeance is darkly funny, graphically violent and gorgeously shot.__It's the characters, and their words, that drive the story here, and Dominik preserves all their scruffy colors ...
McDonagh is less saturated in film and pop culture than Tarantino and less prone than Kaufman to disappear down story wormholes.__The kind of messy, absurdist movie that can lift you out of a crappy mood-at least for a while.__This is one of the best times I've had at the movies in years.__All this narrative nesting and genre-skipping sounds very cerebral on the page, but in practice, Seven Psychopaths is as pleasurably kinetic as can be, full of double-crosses and gunplay and sun-kissed SoCal locations.__Each time it appears that McDonagh, who also directed, has written himself into a cul de sac, he off-roads the movie (sometimes literally) into fresh territory.__Yes, it's a lot to keep track of, but writer-director Martin McDonagh does so with deft humor as the film hurls toward a desert climax, foreshadowed in one of Billy and Marty's exchanges.__For about 75 minutes, Seven Psychopaths is a rollicking good movie - kinetic, clever, funny, and brutal. Then, inexplicably, it falls apart.__McDonagh sets real (and very different) moods for his stories-within-stories. The Los Angeles locations - apart from the obligatory Hollywood sign - seem fresh.__This flick never pretends to be anything but a bright hall of fun-house mirrors. And there, so gloriously distorted, gargoyles look right at home.__While "Seven Psychopaths" is indeed as crazy as it sounds, it's not nearly as smart as it thinks it is.__Too many of its moments of let's-subvert-the-genre seem to leave McDonagh stranded and flailing at just the moment when a Tarantino movie or a Chuck Palahniuk novel is snapping into place.__A toxic little bauble of Hollywood gestures, cliches and tropes.__"Seven Psychopaths" has to be counted as a disappointment.__A collection of weird riffs that not even engaging acting by Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken and Tom Waits can bring together.__"Seven Psychopaths" is a vivid illusion of fun, but sane consumers can find similar sensations in the discount video bin eight days a week.__Meta to the max, filled with clever jokes and observations that stick like barbs and deflated ones that land with a thud, "Seven Psychopaths" is a leisurely riff about movies, violence, storytelling and the art of the steal.__What movie junkie out there wouldn't leap at the chance to see merry pranksters such as Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson go nuts in something called Seven Psychopaths? It's crazy-killer fun.__The violence wears you down. Like one of its nutso characters, "Seven Psychopaths" has a death wish.__There's something overtly mechanical about McDonagh's approach that keeps it all from being as outrageously fun as it's pretending to be. But it is enjoyable to watch the parade of actors McDonagh has assembled ...__Put a gun in the hands of Woody Harrelson and some glorious gab in the mouth of Christopher Walken - the most deadpan of deadpanning thespians - and it's impossible not to make something of this profanity-flying conflation.
__Is there a law that says we can't have some virtuosity with our virtuousness?__Yes, it's a classy affair, but the 40-minute doc's at-times-nerve-wracking power comes from the subjects who put a furry face on the ongoing and daunting issue of climate change.__A children's choir sings and a graphic of the movie title explodes into ice shards to heighten the dramatic impact. Corny? You bet...__Yes, there's some spectacular footage. But there's also an awful lot of filler for a 40-minute movie...__Good on you, polar bears, and kudos to the cinematic expertise that captures them, especially underwater.__That suspenseful sequence is balanced by a fair share of aww moments from playful to plaintive, offering lessons in eco-consciousness.__Imax auteur Greg MacGillivray alternates between intimate wildlife saga and majestic views of the North Pole, offering strong visual compensations for its meandering structure, syrupy tone and excessive sampling of Paul McCartney's back catalog.__Unless you're rich, it may be the closest thing to being there.__Its breathtaking photography has a purpose beyond pretty pictures: to remind us that climate change is causing the frigid Arctic to melt, bringing disruption and challenges to the animals who can only live in snow and ice.__"To the Arctic 3-D" is an impassioned plea for action on global warming, and the passion is intensified by the music.__A movie too focused on force-feeding you its agenda is bound to come across as (sorry, but it must be said) overbearing, no matter how beautifully it's packaged.__MacGillivray, a specialist in gigantic-screen nature movies including The Living Sea, is up to date in his use of 70mm IMAX film, but he's stuck in the past about how to tell a story.__For all the hardware involved, To the Arctic's ultra-high-def images have an oddly plastic sheen.__Arguably a good lesson for kids about preserving our environment, To the Arctic is definitely a threat to our equally endangered good taste.__None__None__None__None__None
While not for the squeamish, Dredd 3D is an effectively gritty B movie accentuated by stylish visuals and irreverent humor.__We have seen this future. And not only does it not work - it no longer even surprises.__Proves a surprisingly unimaginative cops vs. drug lord story, complete with the weathered veteran forced to take a rookie under his wing.__My notes are as follows: "Shoot bad guy." "Shoot bad guy." "Shoot bad guy."__This, finally, is the Dredd movie comic book readers have been anticipating.__Smartly cast and with a sharp team behind the scenes, there is no good reason why "Dredd 3D" is such a clunk-headed action picture.__Every so often there's a suggestion that a police state may actually be a lousy idea, but this thought dies even faster than the disposable characters.__For sci-fi action fans, it's an instant classic.__It's savage, beautiful and loads of fun.__What's exceptional is the orchestration of color, form, light and dark (lots of dark), 3-D technology and digital effects into a look that amounts to a vision.__In a generic way, the environment works. But it drains the material of what should be most unique about it, and leaves Urban twisting despite a tightly coiled performance.__"Dredd" is a lot of murk and grunt with no inner engine. And the unnecessary 3-D only makes it look muddier.__A fine piece of cheap entertainment.__With its dark characters and the grim setting, the film masterfully creates a compelling, nightmarish atmosphere.__Urban manages to give a credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-Eastwood voice - and his chin.__A wickedly dark comic streak breaks up the vivid violence and relentless bleakness of "Dredd 3D."__Mostly a bunch of flatly staged bits of action shot against anonymous backgrounds.__Even if the similarity to The Raid: Redemption is pure coincidence, Dredd 3D suffers greatly by comparison, as it fails to muster even half of the thrills of its predecessor.__Dredd is proudly degenerate-and it never feels compelled to slow down and explain itself.__Urban gives the best "all mouth" performance since the Rocky Horror lips, sneering with seen-it-all gruffness and intoning Dredd's trademark catchphrase-"I am the law"-with the kind of B-movie-inflected soulfulness that feels damn-near profound.
Everyone involved deserves a script with more wit, originality and sense of purpose.__Dennis Quaid hammers away at a nothing role as Thurman's husband, an adulterous alpha dog; it's nearly identical to the one he played earlier this year in What to Expect When You're Expecting, but who's counting?__These are actors due a break. Unfortunately, this comedy-drama about a kids' soccer coach boinking a bunch of desperate housewives doesn't appear to be it.__Smarmy. Dopey. Sloppy. Lazy. Creepy. Tone-deaf. Predictable. Embarrassing. Lousy.__I'll long be haunted by Dennis Quaid's manic performance as a palm-greasing dad who seems to be under the influence of bath salts ...__Playing for Keeps takes place in a tonally incoherent universe, constantly shifting between rom-com farce and mawkish family drama.__The only thing Playing for Keeps teaches us is: Guys, forget the bars and nightclubs. Soccer moms are where the action is.__A film that's pretty much from the assembly line.__An undistinguished, impact-free watch-checker that will soon be vaguely distracting transatlantic travelers who forgot to carry on their iPads.__Butler beware: In acting as in soccer, if you keep taking dives, sooner or later you pay the penalty.__It appears to be an empty-headed piffle of a film about a dashing former professional soccer star coaching his son's team and having affairs with an assortment of randy soccer moms. And that's precisely what it is.__One of those movies that comes "straight from the heart" - the heart of the hack screenwriter's manual that pushes formulaic structure to cover up a lack of compelling characters, genuine emotion or actual humor.__For a trifle - one that probably looked like one on the printed page, too - "Playing for Keeps" somehow attracted a strong cast.__At some point you hope [Butler] will find a movie that will give him the right material to make hearts truly beat faster.__If Gerard Butler exudes rakish charm and Jessica Biel a charming flintiness, then why is Playing for Keeps so utterly charmless?__"Playing for Keeps" plods along pretty much as you'd expect. Its small pleasures come from the relaxed cast.__None of it is especially credible or engaging.__A bedroom farce without the farce, a fish-out-of-water comedy on sun-cracked lake-bed, a story of fatherly redemption that barely gets past the hair-mussing stage.__This is modern movie stardom, and it's depressing: the romantic lead who could also be selling us body spray.__Playing for Keeps doesn't play with a full deck.
So can we somehow make a bargain with the film world: no more Anna Kareninas? You're making idiots of yourselves.__It's a half-success -- a baldly conceptual response to the Leo Tolstoy novel, with a heavy theatrical framework placed around the narrative of girl meets boy, followed by girl meets train.__In this adaptation, director Joe Wright, plus screenwriter Tom Stoppard, are determined to tame the untameable. And they do.__"Anna Karenina," lush as it is, fails to strike a fully human chord.__The very picture of noble failure, it's a bright red heart without a beat.__The metaphorical force of this conceit-insisting on the artifice of the social world that frowns on rapture-is not hard to grasp, but its frailty unsettles some of the actors.__Even more than most versions of "Anna Karenina," this chamber piece is heated by two combustible characters, not by the winds of war and peace.__Thank goodness for Domhnall Gleeson's gentle turn as Oblonsky's friend Levin. The ginger-haired landowner is the movie's warmest figure.__It's hard not to admire Wright's bold approach to Anna Karenina's story of longing and jealousy and societal condemnation.__Knightley and Law are what salvage Wright's interesting stab at something different, taking an interesting, if flawed, experiment and turning it into something better than it probably ought to be.__You don't merely watch Joe Wright's sumptuous "Anna Karenina," but you waltz with it, run with it, whirl with it.__This multilayered movie is not your average Tolstoy adaptation.__This story has been filmed many times, but never with this kind of erotic charge. Knightley is glorious. My advice is to let Wright's Anna Karenina work its strange and marvelous spell.__Often deliberately arch and formal, the performers have been instructed to emphasize the overwrought theatricality of Anna's disapproving social set. What doesn't emerge is Anna's passion. Panic is more like it.__Without Tolsoy's profound interior narration, Anna Karenina is just a soap opera, and for some reason director Joe Wright has decided to compound this problem with deliberate, showy artifice.__For "Anna Karenina" to truly work, you have to look at this two and think, what a tragedy. Instead you look at Anna and think, what a fool.__A handsome, grandly theatrical reimagining of the Tolstoy novel starring his muse, Keira Knightley.__Wright's "Anna Karenina" sings, dances and finally soars, even as its legendary heroine plunges to her most self-destructive depths.__Wright made the movie he wanted to make, and he made it well. It just wasn't worth making.__An intoxicating spectacle that breathes new life into the classic Tolstoy novel, incorporating the notion that all life's a stage -- at least for imperial Russian society.
What is also extraordinary is that almost all the people we see are actors. So this is not a documentary but a moving enactment by people who are themselves moved.__Beasts of the Southern Wild is sheer poetry on screen: an explosion of joy in the midst of startling squalor and one of the most visceral, original films to come along in a while.__A dreamy but strikingly immediate and frayed-at-the-edges, child's-eye view of life on the margins of America.__A beautiful, strange tone poem about childhood and innocence.__The atmosphere Zeitlin develops here is moist with promise and danger, and he moves back and forth between outright fable and pungent reality with an astounding sureness of vision for a first-time director.__"Beasts of the Southern Wild" is a film to get lost in.__Beasts is film as natural mystery museum.__Beasts of the Southern Wild marks one of the most auspicious American directorial debuts in years.__"Beasts of the Southern Wild" stays with you long after you've watched it, like a vaguely troubling but beautiful dream.__Beasts of the Southern Wild is like outsider art: patched together with found materials, conjured up by untrained artists (the actors), and evocative of a truly American attitude of eccentricity, boldness, transcendence.__It hews to no aesthetic or political party line. It is simply life, seen through the kaleidoscope eyes of a brave, imaginative child.__It's unlike any film you've seen.__It's as if you're looking out at new land you've never seen before, or an old one you haven't really paid attention to.__A film that plays less like a grounded, human-scaled story than a dilettantish piece of cultural tourism.__Its fertility and its terror stem from the same truth: To the young mind, there is no sealed barrier cleaving reality from fantasy. Not yet. The wall hasn't been built.__Here is why some of us love the movies: They let you see with brand new eyes.__The filmmaker comes from a perspective of great empathy and considerable skill. But he's a pile driver as a dramatist.__This film is a remarkable creation, imagining a self-reliant community without the safety nets of the industrialized world.__[An] extraordinary southern gothic.__In filmmaking, as in Hushpuppy's world, everything must fit together just right. And in "Beasts of the Southern Wild," everything does.
Filmmakers Chris Kentis and Laura Lau ('Open Water') should have plugged the original's plot holes and straightened out its logic.__The camera's unblinking eye constantly stays with Olsen, and we feel in as much danger as she is.__It's Olsen's performance that makes Sarah's plight matter. And the actress proves that her mesmerizing turn in last fall's Martha Marcy May Marlene -- about a woman on the lam from a cult -- wasn't a fluke.__Silent House feels like a psychotic episode come to life. It's impressive and oppressive, and it very effectively gets on your nerves.__[Olsen is] terrific at showing shifts of emotion just underneath the skin of her wide, china-doll face.__Paranormal Activity has been here before, of course, but Silent House springs tangy new tricks, and Olsen is a primo scream queen.__Olsen is compelling even when the film isn't.__The creeping presence of horror-flick hokum not only robs the scares of their strength, it shatters the realism that the single-take format is trying to convey.__Demonstrating the limits of being too clever in a genre movie, the art-house chiller "Silent House" lets the tenseness of its first act trickle away.__A scary, yet thoughtful - some might even say deep - art-house frightfest.__Sometimes you don't want to know what is lurking in the dark because the answer is just too obvious and dumb.__It's not hard to guess the source of her horror, and so the film's most interesting aspects are its gimmicks rather than its frights.__Sarah does any number of silly things while scurrying through this not-so-silent house, but keeps the audience on her side; you want her to get out of the house immediately but you don't get annoyed with her when she can't.__Even if Silent House had turned out as grimy, gory and stupid as much of its terrorplex ilk, the film would still be an achievement simply owing to its construction.__"Silent House'' is up to something. The filmmakers, Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, must have seen plenty of horror movies worth discussing in a women's studies class.__The tricky camera moves that fill up "Silent House" make for one-half of a nerveracking horror film - before the movie's obviousness just gets on your nerves.__The directors have come up with a new and powerful way to film a thriller: Silent House contains no quick editing in the active moments, and there is never an instance when the movie cuts unexpectedly to something scary as the soundtrack thunders.__"The silence will kill you!" warn the posters for "Silent House." That's only if the boredom doesn't get you first, though.__A denouement more textbook than thrilling stalls some of the movie's power. But the early chills are potent, intense.__It wouldn't work without the exceptional work of Olsen. Her uneasily captivating performance here could almost be viewed as the "why" prequel to Martha Marcy May Marlene, the other chiller from Sundance 2011 that established her as rising star to watch.
For older kids or grown-ups who've dreamed of joining the circus, it's a wildly imaginative treat.__This big-screen vehicle for the popular performance troupe would be more bearable if the exhibitors passed out earplugs along with the 3-D glasses.__It's refreshing to sit back and bask in the sheer joy with which these brightly costumed, stunningly agile performers navigate fire, water and air.__What the movie lacks, unfortunately, is coherence.__"Cirque du Soleil: World's Away" is a rare entertainment, being for the benefit of everyone.__Even if the film is no substitute for the real thing, it is at least an effective advertisement.__It's a big promo reel, and not a carefully disguised one.__"Worlds Away" functions solely as some sort of bargain sampler platter appetizer, never proving it has a real reason of its own to exist.__A moderately enjoyable film that lacks the awe-inspiring visual and aural aplomb of Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil's live shows.__Inevitably, every time Adamson begins to involve the movie audience in the tumbling and wire work, the editor cuts to a different angle, breaking audience identification and concentration.__Loyal fans may love the nonstop riot of imagery and music, though others may not even comprehend what's happening on screen.__The technically well-made movie simply can't replicate the live experience of a Cirque show, and at just over 90 minutes, Worlds Away still feels long.__It serves as a greatest-hits reel of the staggeringly gorgeous and superbly creative acts of the Canadian-born entertainment phenomenon cherry picked from seven Cirque productions.__The rare movie whose title serves as an accurate indicator of whether you will enjoy seeing it.__A negligible narrative takes nothing away from the heart-stopping beauty of the visuals in this 3D spectacular.__A bona fide high-wire act, Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away delivers towering thrills through its candy-colored 3D ode to the titular outfit's astounding acrobatics.__None__None__None__None
It seems ridiculous to dance around plot details when the movie allows the audience to get ahead of the story and to stay there as events laboriously unfold.__It's encouraging to see a wielder of studio heft test his mettle with the all-too-human. In a season of superheroes and their nemeses, Kurtzman takes on characters hurting, hoping, trying to rise to the occasion of family.__People Like Us seems to have been devised for audiences who want to experience an entire year's worth of soap opera complications in a single sitting.__Some of the strongest writing in any movie so far this year.__A good payoff, but the middle drags.__What they've really done is stitch together a decade's worth of Katherine Heigl/Jennifer Aniston/Kate Hudson romantic comedies, and then cut out all the romance and most of the comedy.__Pine and the always-watchable Banks make the best of a bad screenplay, but "People Like Us" gives us nothing that we can relate to.__People Like Us is that sort of on-the-nose drama, where every emotional reaction is telegraphed and delivered right on cue.__"People Like Us" may not be perfect, but Banks is perfectly imperfect.__If it weren't for the whole shared-DNA problem, "People Like Us" might have made a nice pot of romantic mush.__One of those "heartfelt" dramas that was obviously dreamed up to win awards but fell short and is instead being dumped before awards season.__Ultimately, the movie's fundamental truth shines through the Hollywood gloss.__The movie's soap opera quality undermines its efforts to tell a family saga with much believability.__The performances, especially Ms. Banks's Frankie and Ms. Pfeiffer's Lillian, partly compensate for the holes in a story whose timing is hard to swallow.__If not for the icky air of incest, Pine and Banks would make one fine-looking couple.__A sensitive, decent, well-crafted little drama about frailty and forgiveness.__It's a movie that's in a league with films from the golden age of family drama, stories like Ordinary People and Kramer vs. Kramer, although People's dashes of comedy render it far less grim than those examples.__Its hard sell wears you down and draws you in, even as you know you're being manipulated.__It's hideously compelling, like being in the room when one woman asks a woman who isn't pregnant when she's due, except that exchange is typically over in 30 spectacularly awful seconds and this one lasts two hours.__Though it's just a Christmas tree away from being a holiday special, the stellar cast wrings just enough genuine emotion out of a stale premise to make it mostly sweet.
Everything about 'Gone' has the plasticy, leatherette feel of an imitation thriller.__Gifted and sincere as she always is, there's not much Ms. Seyfried can do with this tripe.__It's a significant letdown that after all Jill's running, and all the guessing Seyfried makes us do, the climactic confrontation plays like an uninspired afterthought.__A movie that makes "Murder on the Orient Express" feel like"The Silence of the Lambs"by comparison.__No money should ever change hands in any Gone-related interaction, unless it is because you are buying matches and gasoline to set all the copies of it on fire.__Siblings aren't the only things missing from Gone: Suspense, scares and common sense are all likewise MIA.__It lies there flapping like a dying fish. Skip it.__Which stinks worse? The absurdly large pile of red herrings Gone amasses? Or the film's sub-Scooby Doo conclusion?__Ms. Seyfried belongs to a stable of blank-faced, saucer-eyed beauties whose limited appeal may conquer the small screen but so far has failed to tame the large.__While Gone has some visual style, the cheap and melodramatic script fails to make it to the party.__It's never fully convincing in the way it lays out a bread-crumb trail for its suffering protagonist to follow to the truth. But it does find a little new life in a familiar formula.__A thriller so fixated on red herrings that viewers may stop caring if anyone's really in danger.__A low-pulse thriller that evaporates from memory with the last credit.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A mostly middling drama.__The story-within-a-story-within-a-story is so slight and inconsequential, like the tiniest of a set of Russian nesting dolls, that we may be forgiven for letting our minds wander toward bedtime and tomorrow's errands.__The premise is ambitious -- if not a little hokey -- but the meager themes of ephemeral authorship and constructed realities aren't exactly revelatory.__Bradley Cooper's funniest movie since "The Hangover" - unfortunately, unintentionally this time ...__This film's layered storytelling lacks the fluidity, grace, or good humour, to pull off its conceit.__Romanticized claptrap.__This is a film that's thoughtful and elegant, with just enough loose strings to keep things intriguing.__A well-acted but narratively limp indie that's undermined by a failure to connect emotionally with its audience.__It would have been more fun if I'd brought something to throw at the screen.__It's a snooze.__Writer/directors Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal chose to make The Words as bland and obvious as its title, wringing out any subtlety or artistry.__"The Words" is a decent, ambitious, unoriginal film about a decent, ambitious, unoriginal writer. Both aim for greatness. Both fall short.__A clever, entertaining yarn that doesn't bear close scrutiny.__The Words founders on a spurious dichotomy between love and art.__The Words resonates - richly, remarkably.__I had planned to watch it, but there's nothing to see.__It reinforces the misconception that great works arrive in a burst of creativity brought on by a tragic love affair, ideally in Paris.__Even with one story line and time frame too many, the movie conjures a mean Faustian bargain and leaves a classic dramatic question hanging in its air: What would you do if faced with similar circumstances?__While it's no chore to watch so many appealing actors, it does feel like something of a waste to see them hemmed in by such flat material.__For the most part, it's an adequate romantic drama orbiting an intriguing moral dilemma, but the decision to use a three-layered approach to tell the story makes little sense from a dramatic or narrative perspective.
Gives its subject too light a treatment for the life-affirming message to feel earned.__It delivers broad laughs and tugs at the heartstrings without delving too deep - the very definition of a crowd-pleaser.__If you loved "The Bucket List," you'll be exclaiming, "Incroyable!"__The easygoing posture and strong casting keep The Intouchables from stumbling over vexing questions of race, class and disability.__A box office phenomenon in France, this crowd-pleasing drama is based on a true story but sticks closely to the template for a Hollywood buddy movie.__More than a little unrealistic.__The Intouchables works as a crowd-pleaser not because it's true, but because it's a plausible enchantment.__"The Intouchables" is actually quite touchable.__Some of the elements in the film are inexplicable and some are undeveloped, but there are a handful of nicely crafted set pieces.__I checked the production materials for "The Intouchables" and failed to find confirmation that any of this was inspired by 1987's "Disorderlies," in which the Fat Boys push old Ralph Bellamy around to his heart's content.__It's the classic odd-couple buddy movie setup, only it'll pull at your heartstrings, whether you want it to or not.__You don't have to completely buy into the premise of The Intouchables to appreciate the very good acting by Cluzet and Sy.__It has warmth, humor and an understated sweetness that is not to be taken for granted.__"The Intouchables" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes.__Movies in which black characters, however nuanced or well meaning, act in subservience to whites, often raise hackles. For me, it all depends on how it's done.__Two very different men, joined for purely businesslike purposes, finding their way to an intuitive, interdependent and quietly fulfilling union.__From "It Happened One Night" to "Trading Places," it's yet another entry in the category of "rich people need ordinary folks to show them how to live it up."__An exuberantly charming French buddy comedy that proves an audience will suspend disbelief and follow an unlikely story as long as it's superbly crafted.__It is possible to summarize the experience of watching "The Intouchables" in nine words: You will laugh; you will cry; you will cringe.__The film fulfills its feel-good promise, as long as it's seen as the fairy tale it was meant to be.
This is a dog's breakfast of a film, lurching from simpering teen-romcom sentiment to off-colour paedophile gags to sub-'Juno' hipster cultural references to a lecture on the woes of single motherhood without breaking stride.__This is utterly disposable stuff, but it does have its moments.__Screenwriter Max Werner and director Josh Schwartz clearly have several well-worn copies of Adventures in Babysitting between them, but they keep the gags coming at a brisk pace.__Though it doesn't always hit the hilarity target, this tween-targeted romp strikes a sweet-but-not-sappy balance.__There's little fun to be had in this foolish Halloween comedy that generates many more eye rolls than laughs.__It feels like a project that was pitched for the CW but watered down for Nickelodeon audiences. In the end, everyone loses.__"Fun Size" presents the broiling hormones of youth at room temperature.__A 90-minute theatrical release from Nickelodeon Productions that, if anything, should have aired as a half-hour Nickelodeon special.__"Fun Size" lives up to the candy correlation of its title. It's pleasurable enough in the moment, but the buzz fades quickly.__There's an effervescent tempo to "Fun Size," a gleeful "After Hours" for All Hallow's Eve, but for tweens and teenagers, and set in Cleveland.__Boobs. Boobs. Boobs. Boobs. Boobs. If your tween can handle that, they can handle Nickelodeon's naughtiest kids' movie__"Fun Size" seems trapped in a limbo between a hyperkinetic comedy for kids and something more outlaw for teens.__Just like a Halloween miniatures assortment, something for everyone - or no one, as the case may be.__The fun to be had in Fun Size, a 'tween comedy featuring Victoria Justice of the Nickelodeon TV series Victorious, is neither gigantic nor minuscule; it's just about fun size, which is probably enough.__Like a "fun size" chocolate bar, it's just empty calories. It's a momentary pleasure, instantly forgotten.__By the end of this romp, "Fun Size" actually accomplished something charming: sentimentality without normality.__Justice is a pretty, personality-free screen presence, while the more interesting cast members, like Levy and Handler, are stuck in shrill, unsympathetic roles.__Befitting the title, there's little nutritional value, but there's a bit of sweetness inside the throwaway wrapper.__A hydra-headed attempt to dirty up the Nickelodeon brand while simultaneously scrubbing raunchy high-school hookup tropes into family-friendly shape.__There remains a huge market for a great Halloween teen comedy, but Fun Size is the disappointing apple that your crazy-haired neighbor gives you instead of candy. Feel free to dump this one in the bushes.
"Bernie' isn't a monumental film, but it is a finely tuned character study with some nice innovations.__The question of why the law must always be upheld, regardless of consequences, gives this light, amiable movie a surprising heft and weight.__Bernie has chuckles, but it's hardly riotous. And this is a good thing.__Propelled by a perfectly cast trio of stars whose eccentricities shine in singular character roles, Bernie is charmer.__Black is terrific. Rather than winking at the audience, he plays Bernie as a guy who's thoroughly unaware that there's anything unconventional about his behavior.__"Bernie" unfolds into many equally rich narrative strands: love story, southern Gothic slice-of-life and, finally tragedy and legal thriller...__Linklater's a glider, not a pile-driver; he hangs back when other directors prefer to bore in.__It allows director Richard Linklater to explore his own roots while telling a remarkable real-life story, something too crazy for anyone to make up.__It's a darkly funny, irresistible film - and one with a masterful performance at its center.__The movie's bright and endearing and surprisingly lacking in a point. I wish I liked it better, but it's a start.__A one-of-a-kind comedy based on the real homicide of an innocent old lady.__[A] weirdly funny, inspiring film.__Some of the best performances come from real-life residents of Carthage as they share their recollections on camera.__A dead-solid-perfect depiction of small-town life.__Bernie isn't a particularly likeable guy and Black's opaque performance never lets us get beneath the surface to find a character we might actually care about.__Linklater, admirably unconcerned about how his film can be categorized, has made a comedy, a drama and most certainly a character study.__Watching Bernie is a little like sitting on a shady front porch and gossiping with the town tattlers.__I had to forget what I knew about Black. He creates this character out of thin air, it's like nothing he's done before, and it proves that an actor can be a miraculous thing in the right role.__Has a little bit of an East Texas Fargo feel. Jack Black gives one of his best performances.__A jovial yet gracefully told tale.
The stars are endearing enough to keep things tolerable, though you may wonder why even McGregor's Scots brogue sounds artificially sweetened here.__Hallstrom shores up his film with a terrific cast that can often make up for the parts that sag under the uneven weight of preciousness.__It's an engaging love story that should appeal to moviegoers with a flair for the offbeat.__Only Scott Thomas, biting off all her sentences like a piranha, rescues "Salmon Fishing" from being a by-the-numbers romantic comedy; you wish the redoubtable Ms. Maxwell had her own movie.__While "Salmon Fishing" fritters away the comic momentum of its madcap opening chapters, it's like angling -- a pleasant diversion if you can look below the surface and muster the patience to appreciate it.__A charming little movie.__While both Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor are enormously appealing actors, Hallstrom has made a movie that pretends it is something it's not -- namely, an intelligent romantic comedy.__Despite sporting the worst cinematic title since The Chumscrubber, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen hooks some charming laughs and a quaint romance by not delving too deeply into its subject matter.__I'll say this much for Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, it's got a catchy title. But beware of films with catchy titles. The films themselves usually don't live up to them.__Salmon Fishing was a novel first and you can see how all these juggled balls could stay in the air on the page, but in movie form, many of them just seem extraneous.__Hallstrom ... goes for a "Local Hero"-type feeling, but the movie has to swim upstream to get anywhere.__Enter forewarned. Or better yet - head upstream and don't be lured in at all.__Make the leap, and you'll be delighted by a movie that's sugary goodness, a guilty pleasure.__Trust me: These are characters with whom it's a pleasure to spend a couple of hours.__Makes use of pink-fleshed vertebrates as the inspiration for sweet romantic musings on love and life, faith and patience - and the courage to go against the flow.__Somehow managing to be both twee and edgy, the absurdist but gently winning romantic comedy Salmon Fishing in the Yemen works a strange kind of wonder.__The appeal of the film depends on the charm of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Blunt, whose polite but discreetly charged connection is the story's emotional center.__In the end Salmon Fishing reassures more than it excites, but all props are due to a commercial movie that helps demolish the stereotype of the Arab as bloodthirsty primitive.__The withering political pungency, the commentary on terrorism and the searing critique of nationalism and patriotism that made the book a best-seller in the U.K. are replaced by a comforting surface sheen and a lot of unconvincing nonsense...__It is what it is, and if you find McGregor and Blunt appealing, the movie will have you feeling similarly about it.
There are holes in the plot, to be sure, but somehow we don't mind, because for all the unbearable tension of Jarecki's script, the central attraction here is the man in the arena.__A tight thriller that shows [its] handsome star in fine form as a morally bankrupt financier playing fast and loose with ethics and the law.__Gere gets the role he has been suiting up for ever since he was first designer-dressed for a murder rap in American Gigolo.__Part thriller, part character study, and it moves swiftly and confidently, with many details that feel exactly right.__This isn't very effective as a thriller, though it's a provocative fable about our ambivalent feelings toward financial elites.__The screenplay, written by first-time director Nicholas Jarecki, keeps us guessing, which is one of the best compliments one can pay to a movie of this sort.__Gere's very good at making Robert's compromises seem more human than horrid. He portrays the philanthropic, philandering patriarch with his customary twinkle.__Giving the tale an extra dose of reality is Richard Gere.__"Arbitrage" becomes far more complex than just dramatized anti-corporate polemic, or even a simple fall from grace.__I'm not sure any five pages of this script by director Nicholas Jarecki hold together.__Mediocre at best.__Features an exceedingly dapper Richard Gere in a series of nice suits and handsome close-ups that serve no purpose other than to remind us how exceedingly dapper Richard Gere looks in nice suits and handsome close-ups.__Arbitrage overcomes some pulpy plot twists and a little anti-corporate sermonizing to become a brisk tale of a financial wizard whose sins have returned to collect a debt.__A tense and chilling horror story for financially fraught times.__It could readily be mistaken for the work of an experienced and justifiably self-confident filmmaker with a nose for newsy stories, a knack for telling them tersely, and a gift for directing actors__Rather than seeming pat, Jarecki's straightforward cynicism is pointed and purposeful.__"Arbitrage" is a fine showcase for the silky talents of Richard Gere, who's so smooth here you could spread him on toast.__The movie wants to be an instant Sidney Lumet classic along the lines of "Serpico" or "Prince of the City," but it doesn't have the roots. It's new money.__Unfolding in somber tones and among hard surfaces, Arbitrage has the slickness of new bank notes and the confidence of expensive tailoring.__Mr. Gere is one of cinema's great walkers, graced with a suggestively predatory physical suppleness, and he slips through the movie like a panther. He's the film's most deluxe item.
This is a solid if at times too conventional tale of a classic moral conflict.__[It's mostly] a well-wrought drama that feels genuine as it goes about spinning a tale worthy of our challenging times.__Promised Land is more effective as an anti-fracking screed than as a drama.__Damon and McDormand are terrific as co-workers seeking the same goal, though they see their work from different points of view.__This isn't a movie about easy fixes, be they personal or political; it's a film about long-term problems.__Far too awkward and contrived a drama to change many hearts and minds.__The 50/50 split between profiteers and tree-huggers might reflect the nation as a whole, but it makes for diluted drama.__Damon's performance as corporate salesman Steve Butler is one of his best.__A well-intentioned look at a fraught issue, but the Damon-Krasinski screenplay ultimately opts for Hollywood oversimplification.__A love triangle involving the two men and a local schoolteacher (Rosemarie DeWitt) seems more like a commercial necessity than an integral part of the story, and the small-town types are indifferently realized by director Gus Van Sant.__Damon and Krasinski co-wrote the script, and they do a nice job of giving the usual confrontations a gentle and surprising spin.__One of several ways this ... picture falls short is in trying to sell a personal-salvation story as a salve to the conundrum it presents.__"Promised Land" offers an experience that's alternately amusing and frustrating, full of impassioned earnestness as well as saggy sections.__The movie threatens to become one of those late '60s/early '70s heavy-handed message movies, but it's somewhat salvaged by Damon's innate likability and the chemistry among the cast.__It's as if the people behind Promised Land only agreed to make the movie if there was an unambiguous "policy statement" at the end, and that's what we're subjected to.__"Promised Land" is a fine place to start appreciating Matt Damon, who always makes it seem as if everybody else is acting and he's just going through the movie being natural.__Matt Damon's new film "Promised Land" starts off on the right foot - and then shoots itself in it.__Damon wants to put you in Very Serious mode and have you think of "issue movies" like "The China Syndrome," but all I could do was laugh and think of "Lolita."__Despite their Everyman appeal, Damon and Krasinski don't create much by way of emotional investment, instead becoming mirror images of their most mild-mannered, white-bread selves.__Though the film eventually caves to sentiment and stereotype, its alert performances and muted rhythms offer much to enjoy in the interim.
It's safe to assume its sharp comments on what kids can do to marriage - and friendships - come from years of observation.__Pleasant but overfamiliar.__Sitcom-amusing, in that middle-of-the-road way.__It's the kind of cutesy idea that doesn't ring remotely true.__This is a sharp, funny, touching and utterly winning slice of New York.__[A] crass, shallow cash-in.__Imagine - a romantic comedy that's actually both. It's been a long, long time.__Whom is this movie for, really? It's too tame for the whooping crowds of women who made hits of the Sex and the City movies and Bridesmaids. And for sure it isn't for parents with kids.__It's funny without being ridiculous, sweet without turning sentimental, even though it involves parenthood.__[Westfeldt] makes a promising directorial debut with this good-natured dramedy, boosted in large part by an outstanding ensemble.__"Friends with Kids" goes on a beat or two too long, and lands in the obvious place, but it's filled with smarts and laughs and passion.__Credit Westfeldt, who is also the writer and director, with a classic setup for farce, brightly executed.__Too many sequences feel generic, from the unexamined privilege that serves as the movie's cultural backdrop to the now-requisite scene of a man changing a diaper while covered in baby poop.__In the crumbling passion of a once hot-to-trot couple (a perfect Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamm), [it] locates a jagged heart that no amount of zingers can surpass.__It offers the rare combination of romance, humor, an inventive conceit and social relevance, without adhering slavishly to rom-com conventions.__Not even the outcome's predictability (hint: romantic comedies have happy endings) can dampen the frothy results.__At its warm heart, "Friends with Kids" is a funny, grown-up love story (very grown-up; the language in the final scene will raise some eyebrows) about people we enjoy hanging out with, and who seem like people we already know.__There's a framework for a fun comedy here, but no one says anything witty and none of the characters emerge as anything resembling a real person with bigger problems than the kind of babies-are-a-handful stuff that Erma Bombeck once built a career out of.__Westfeldt is the pulse of Friends With Kids, presenting us with life in all of its vibrant, messy sprawl.__Even as it zeros in on radical shifts in the mechanics and mores of parenthood, it sits quite comfortably in a well-worn romantic-comedy groove.
Though it's clear we're meant to be moved by the big finale, the sight of these two together is so unsettling it's hard not to start rooting for the asteroid.__Steve Carell and Keira Knightley make for one of the most unlikely and yet one of the most touching romantic couples of the year.__This is an exceedingly promising directorial debut for Scafaria, who adapted the winning romance Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist.__The genuine sweetness of the friendship that develops between these two wins out over any of the movie's failings.__A movie that may be, in its own small, weird way, the most bizarrely bittersweet and oddly beautiful romance you've seen in quite awhile.__The problem with this nice-try comedy is the nice-guy protagonist.__Scafaria seems to get disoriented by her own scenario, boxing herself into an apocalypse whose initial absurdities feel so wonderfully right, but where to go from there?__It's too bad the movie chose to go so gentle into that good night.__"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World'' has its laughs, but pretty much every single one of them is in the trailer.__Unsure whether it wants to be a quirky, sad-eyed indie pixie or a brassy, raunchy broad, it veers uneasily between the two, never quite settling into a comfortable or recognizable groove.__This is a romantic comedy for people who don't like rom-coms. There's no chance of a happy ending, but its tender mercies speak volumes.__"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World," a half-tender portrait of two very lonely hearts in the closing weeks of humanity's run on Earth, is a strange movie.__It seems downright unfair that billions of people have to die so that a middle-aged sad sack can cop a cuddle with a cute, younger bohemian neighbor.__While there are some amusing moments involving the film's stellar cast of second bananas, the "quirky" and utterly artificial love story at its center makes Armageddon feel like the preferable option.__"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" has plenty of tonal problems -- given the concept, how could it not? -- but Carell's introspective, dryly funny performance is a consistent delight.__Scafaria, who made such a splash with her cheeky screenplay adaptation of "Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist" in 2008, is simply over her head here.__Like the romance it portrays, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is brief, sweet, funny and sad.__Seeking a Friend for the End of the World offers the beats of a series of bad news / worse news jokes. This is not necessarily a good thing.__One of the year's most emotionally affecting movies.__Carell and Knightley give it their bittersweet best. But I never rooted for them as a couple. And in a romance, even one with tragic notes, that really is the end of the world.
__Just a pointless exercise in sadism.__People in Hollywood need to work and surely "The Collection" created a lot of jobs, but there must be a better way.__Dull and repetitive, even by the standards of an already repetitive genre.__Melton and Dunstan have created little more than a hollow shell for an empty box.__There's a bad movie every week, but it takes a special one to make you start anticipating the decline of Western civilization.__More than anything, the sequel feels like an excuse for Dunstan and his effects team to see how creative they can be in the bloody killing of people using pointy metal objects.__Genre aficionados are likely to revel in every crunched bone, gratuitous decapitation and slow-motion iron-maiden impaling.__The director Marcus Dunstan and his co-writer, Patrick Melton, strike again.__It's never boring. Dumb, gross, gratuitous, and overly familiar, sure. But never boring.__A murkily directed bore "dealing" with the subject of serial killers and revenge ...__Remarkably, the result manages to be both more preposterous and more efficient than its predecessor, with a couple of deaths occurring so swiftly they border on the subliminal.__This sequel to 2009's The Collector features enough gratuitous carnage to satisfy hardcore horror fans, if few others.__An energetic but utterly weightless exercise in slice-and-dice cinema.__For those who are on board, it's a more absurd yet equally efficient bit of grisly fun; for those who never were, don't expect this one to change your mind regarding mindless bloodshed.__None__None__None__None__None
This is realism that enlarges our conception of the term.__Now at the end of the year comes a masterpiece, not just the best of the year, but one of the best ever: Michael Haneke's Amour.__Trintignant perfectly captures the resolve that eventually borders on obsession, as the woman he loves gradually, maddeningly, disappears before his eyes, and he does whatever he can to prevent it, though he knows it's impossible.__Many viewers will find echoes of their grandparents, parents, or even themselves in these characters.__A movie that is utterly worthy of its all-encompassing title.__The resulting interplay of ruthless restraint and unavoidable passion, plus the film's refusal to shrink from depicting the inevitable horrors of physical deterioration, is devastating.__In many ways it's the best horror film I've ever seen. At the same time, it's hard to recommend; I believe I will be struggling to forget this film as long as I live. I doubt I'll succeed.__It is an inspirational film in the truest sense, and one to see with someone you love.__As remarkable as Haneke's films are, not a one has been as transcendently generous as Amour, which is nominated for five Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best foreign-language film.__"Amour" isn't easy to watch, but its rewards are many.__"Amour" isn't just a great movie, it's a movie that may actually do you some good.__Shot in long, static takes, Amour stares directly into the indignities of old age and the curse of a slow death.__This is a masterpiece.__Each actor draws on a lifetime's worth of experience, performing with grace and rare, uncompromising realism.__There's nowhere to hide: The film cuts no corners and stings with the authenticity of life's fragility.__The movie avoids melodrama; instead, it's just extraordinarily intimate, with touches of visual poetry like the pigeon that gets into the apartment and won't leave, an image of our own heedless tenacity.__The film is a graphic portrayal of the unfunny end game we're all fated to play; the title is just a simple declaration of how best to play it.__"Amour" is also unforgettable and one of a kind, two hours of torment that, in the end, you will probably not regret.__Small, sure and stunningly acted, this is a picture of exacting control, which is to be expected from Haneke, whose works include Cache and The White Ribbon.__[Haneke] has put his finger on a very particular kind of heartbreak: seeing a lover give up not on you but on the life you've shared.
[It] may have the look of a prestige picture, but it plays more like a version of FDR's life as told by TMZ, focusing on naughty details and ignoring the historical implications of the events depicted.__Somewhat uneven and ultimately underwhelming, but there's plenty to admire and enjoy here nonetheless.__A languid, tedious effort that never bothers to get to the heart of its characters, the film is a shallow reading of a significant time told mostly from the viewpoint of a lifeless character.__It's never a bad movie, but it can't quite gel into a good one either.__Hyde Park on the Hudson' is a forgettable historical footnote.__Essentially, Hyde Park on Hudson is a Shakespearean revel.__Murray's spot-on portrayal of a man juggling myriad pressures and demands, from petty to momentous, marks one of the film's greatest strengths.__There's an alliance of interesting stories fighting for dominance here, but instead of a clear victory, "Hyde Park on Hudson" is the site of a muddled truce.__By all rights "Hyde Park on Hudson" should be a slyly funny treat. It is, in places - but it's also strangely flat, as if screenwriter Richard Nelson lost interest somewhere along the way.__Roger Michell's brightly lit film turns America's 32nd president from world statesman into naughty codger, quite the fall from grace for the man who led his country through the Great Depression and the Second World War.__Just think of it as a movie about a friendly, sick old man who can be quite a handful, and put the real FDR out of your mind.__Casting Murray as FDR may feel like a gamble or a stunt at first, but after a few minutes the rightness of the choice is inarguable.__[A] middlebrow, middleweight and middling project ...__A deceptively subtle portrayal in which the mostly deadpan comic star disappears beneath the pince-nez and the snappy brim of a presidential fedora, Murray offers a fascinating glimpse into a complex and charismatic figure ...__I don't know if I've ever seen a movie as spectacularly tone-deaf as "Hyde Park on Hudson."__They're a fun bunch, these Roosevelts and their friends. But even in this crowd, fun's just not enough.__Murray, who has a wider range than we sometimes realize, finds the human core of this FDR and presents it tenderly.__This is a cool, collected, concise film - to its detriment.__Michell manages to wring the requisite mixture of pathos and mirth from the confab.__"Hyde Park on Hudson" doesn't dig deep enough into the man, or his women, to be a great film.
Scatty, intriguing but slightly undercooked ...__The movie spends too much time off the set of Psycho, where the real story was, and focuses instead on incidental matters that feel like outtakes.__An overly literal idea of the brilliant director, but an entertaining visit to the set of a horror classic.__Filmed with lots of style and a macabre sense of humor the master himself would have enjoyed.__It's tough work giving good face to an iconic role, yet Johansson manages to show Leigh as a thoughtful professional aware of the interpersonal booby-traps set by her director for his leading ladies.__Hopkins has been fitted out prosthetically to resemble Hitchcock and he does a reasonably good job of impersonating him, but it's a foredoomed effort.__It's not exactly a perfect marriage, but Hopkins and Mirren create a funny, exasperated chemistry.__Too much of the time "Hitchcock" plays cute and comfortable. It simply lacks weight.__"Hitchcock" is an amusing lark, but the clumsy way it dissects the director is for the birds.__Its ambitions are modest, its payoffs pleasant enough.__They could have subtitled it "Dial M for Muddle."__Hopkins makes a wonderful Hitchcock.__"Hitchcock" is, well, fun. More fun than good, really.__Hitchcock once famously said that a good filmmaker should always "always make the audience suffer as much as possible." I don't think he meant the kind of suffering "Hitchcock" inflicts on its audience.__Hopkins' Hitch may not reveal inner demons. He's entertaining, as is Mirren. It's fun to watch them elevate a rosy assessment of a first-rate popular artist and the woman who never got the credit she deserved.__There's something tonally off about the master of anxiety, neurosis and disquiet being depicted in a story this cozy.__Gervasi's workmanlike direction and the by-the-numbers storytelling don't diminish the impact of a tale that, even in its bare outlines, is one for the ages.__I genuinely can't figure out why "Hitchcock" was made or who its target audience might be, except that it gratifies our apparently universal appetite to believe that creative geniuses are hateful freaks.__They make it all up, and it's still boring.__Hitchcock is a stab in the dark. The film gets the suspense part of Alfred Hitchcock right, but for the wrong reasons.
Floating atop the explosive breakers, like an overabundance of phytoplankton, is a roiling colony of cliches that stops at nothing to dominate the screenplay.__It's a perfect fortune cookie of a movie, full of bland life lessons for everybody; would that there were some drama or style in it somewhere along the way.__For Hanson and Apted, this is a rather inconsequential effort.__The heart-pounding surfing scenes are epic but the script can barely keep its head above the waves in the dramatized biopic Chasing Mavericks.__When every frayed plot device you've predicted makes its inevitable appearance, at least you'll have the majestic waves off the California coastline to comfort you.__Never really [delivers] the sun-in-your-face, salt-in-your-hair, sandy-cocky thrill of surfing or surf culture.__Neither Curtis Hanson nor the fellow veteran director who replaced him when Hanson took ill, Michael Apted, can do much with the hokey sequences on land.__The tsunami of schmaltzy melodrama ... threatens to swamp the proceedings, which at heart are actually kind of thrilling and inspirational.__With the massive power and mesmerizing curl of the giant waves, Chasing Mavericks is at its best offshore.__"Chasing Mavericks" moves as fast as a runner in waist-high water and wears out its welcome.__The outstanding big-wave footage proves more credible than the overfamiliar dramatics in Chasing Mavericks.__Granted, both directors have been adrift for the past decade, but even someone with water in his ears should have sensed that this script needed a rescue.__"Chasing Mavericks" falls into the "Machine Gun" category of disappointments - at best it's a wash.__The surfers and the surfing, along with the natural beauty of the California coastline, help balance the movie's weak areas, including its lamentably one-dimensional protagonist.__The sinking feeling starts as soon as "Chasing Mavericks" opens, with Gerard Butler's solemn narration: "We all come from the sea," he intones, "but we are not all of the sea."__With a storyline as by-the-numbers as a square dance, the movie's one surprise comes with the closing credits -- namely, that this trite "inspirational" movie is the product of two world-class filmmakers, Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted.__A family movie of aggravating blandness.__Chasing Mavericks manages to sufficiently overcome the obstacles with admittedly affecting results.__Nothing special; decent enough considering the circumstances.__"Chasing Mavericks" invents minor conflicts but avoids major problems, coming off less like a biographical drama than a visit from a guest lecturer during Sunday school.
Lewin, who has fought his own lifelong polio battle, handles tricky material with a gentle, empathetic touch.__Thanks to Lewin's light but assured touch, The Sessions never wears its theological preoccupations heavily, instead allowing transcendence to creep up on the audience quietly.__A very different kind of love story, breaking taboos lightly, with sensitivity and humor.__Achieves its sunny disposition by pulling punches.__A funny, tender and mostly unsentimentalized movie about physical and emotional triumph.__An absolute delight.__Forced to do all his acting with his face, Hawkes displays the kind of camera-arresting capability that has earned others Oscar nominations.__This is a crowd-pleaser of the finest sort.__It's really a three-character comedy/drama, with the best elements of both genres.__Using only his tilted head, his eyes, nose, and mouth and that quizzical voice, Hawkes brings O'Brien to life.__With its assertive hero and inclusive humor, "The Sessions" is an inspirational drama you can feel good about in the morning.__It's funny and well-meaning, with great performances, but the story plays out more like an Afterschool Special with full-frontal nudity.__Most often with The Sessions the blunt comedy outweighs the drift toward sanctimony.__It sends viewers out of the theater with a heightened sense of the physical and a real feeling for all the things that sex means in human life.__The achievement of this simply told, exceptionally fine film is the clarity with which it portrays the drama of a good soul in an inert body.__Hawkes' performance is the must-see hook of The Sessions, but Hunt gives this funny, touching movie its soul.__Character actor John Hawkes is often cast as a frightening rustic (Winter's Bone, Martha Marcy May Marlene), but he gives a tender and witty performance here as Mark O'Brien.__The joy of The Sessions goes beyond sexual healing. It makes physical intimacy far more a matter of the heart, and you won't be alone wiping an occasional tear.__O'Brien was the subject of an Oscar-winning short "Breathing Lessons," and it seems likely that "The Sessions" will receive a few nominations of its own. It deserves them.__This film rebukes and corrects countless brainless and cheap sex scenes in other movies. It's a reminder that we must be kind to one another.
Odd, intermittently amusing but wholly unsatisfying, an oddball experiment that simply doesn't work.__As a low-budget independent not necessarily intended for a broad audience, Casa doesn't have to bow to the middle-of-the-road multiplex appeal that handcuffs many SNL-pedigreed films. That works to the film's great benefit.__I tend to be amused by Ferrell in most circumstances, and the things I like about him - his bizarre sensibilities hidden beneath a mainstream exterior, his unwavering sincerity regardless of his characters' absurdity - are on display here.__I regard Casa de Mi Padre as an interesting but failed experiment.__Ferrell is an hombre loco. Mi gusta.__Will Ferrell tiene cojones grandes.__A product as cheap, empty and worth of a good beating as a pinata.__For a movie with basically one idea -- spoofing the telenovela -- "Casa" is determined to take it as far as possible.__Really, Casa de mi Padre is a skit blown up to a feature flick, amusing for a while until its welcome wears out.__As a full-length feature, "Casa" is simply a funny concept that starts to go stale around the 10-minute mark.__It's perfect for a short clip on FunnyorDie.com. Padded out to feature length, with a bunch of other slight and unmemorable laughs, it wears thin.__It's really strange, and it's really subtitled.__Is "Casa de Mi Padre" brilliant or pointless? Indubitably it's both, as Ron Burgundy might put it.__This very funny spoof of telenovelas and classic Mexican westerns is decidedly offbeat and absurdly daffy.__A lot of the film unrolls like wasted opportunities, placeholders between the cheesy musical interludes and ludicrous Peckinpah-esque violence.__"Casa de Mi Padre" demands that you not take it seriously, and for the most part that's easy to do.__The film feels ultimately hollow, perhaps because mocking soap operas is the comic's equivalent of shooting fish tacos in a barrel.__It's a solid short film stretched to Silly Putty thinness.__Ferrell, as he's done in Anchorman, Talladega Nights and Step Brothers, walks undaunted through the amiable absurdity, delivering his not-exactly-mellifluous espanol in earnest flurries, as the dialogue, and the bullets, fly.__About five minutes of its mercifully short 84 minutes would make a nice sketch on Ferrell's Funny or Die.
As generic as the title, this historical drama spares no cliche in depicting Mexico's Cristero War of the late 1920.__It's the stuff of real life, and of high drama, but Dean Wright's directorial debut translates little of that latter quality to the screen.__"For Greater Glory" is at times so heavy-handed that the movie itself seems at war. Unfortunately, the enemy is not just a repressive administration, but the audience.__This historical drama about the little-known Cristero War in 1920s Mexico is more educational than involving.__Despite enough good intentions to pave a four-lane highway, the ardently sincere but dramatically unfocused For Greater Glory plays like a multipart miniseries that has been hacked down to feature length.__The sometimes painfully sincere and slow-moving "For Greater Glory" clearly aspires to be inspirational, but history won't cooperate.__The result is pretty much as forgettable as the Cristeros War.__It is a scattered mess, as earnest as a folk song, but like a folk song that goes on for two hours and 23 minutes.__Ultimately a stodgy, overblown and repetitive slog.__The jamming together of so much history and melodrama makes for a handsome movie that is only rarely gripping.__It's a powerful, visually elegant picture from first-time director Dean Wright.__If Michael Bay woke up one day and said to himself, "I need to make a movie about religious persecution in 1920s Mexico," I imagine it would look something like this.__The scenes just plod along without much to help distinguish them. It's not an epic movie so much as an epic run-on sentence.__Director Dean Wright and screenwriter Michael Love fail to develop compelling characters or to construct a coherent plot.__When its passion connects with several strong performances, it transcends a heavy piousness.__In spite of its R rating and sometimes horrifying imagery, For Greater Glory seems to belong in the classroom of a lazy Sunday-school teacher rather than a movie theater.__It is well-made, yes, but has such pro-Catholic tunnel vision I began to question its view of events.__It is plodding, lazily filmed, gassy with James Horner's score, and pads its runtime only by way of tolling repetition.__This drama styles itself as a cinematic epic, but its substance is as flimsy as a Jack Chick pamphlet.__None
________It mixes attempts at realism and grit with transparently Hollywoodized good guys-vs.-bad guys social melodrama. That requires a deft directorial hand, but director Daniel Barnz doesn't seem to have it.__Social-issue movies can have real societal impact. That's why Won't Back Down, which presses a lot of hot buttons, deserves to be taken seriously, and criticized seriously, on its own terms.__Won't Back Down doesn't wholly make the grade.__Americans desperately need to have some difficult conversations about the state of public education, but Won't Back Down goes about the task too awkwardly to be helpful or interesting.__"Won't Back Down" details a bureaucratic process, and yet it plays more like an intense, emotional movie about parents and children.__While the cast is filled with award winners, writer-director Daniel Barnz is a dunce who can't construct an argument without employing flimsy logic and cardboard characters.__So didactic that viewers are likely to feel less uplifted than lectured.__The film makes a serious effort to present the other side's points.__[Barns] pours on the corn syrup pretty heavy in parts and it's pretty obvious the film has a clear agenda ...__A drama that's as intellectually crude as it is emotionally calculated.__Even terrific casting and a well-intentioned story don't add up to a wholehearted cinematic win.__So shamelessly manipulative and hopelessly bogus it will make you bite your tongue in regret and despair.__Teachers unions are by no means perfect, but Won't Back Down turns them into public school enemy number one.__Though it's wonderfully acted, the film stacks the deck so badly that it fails as drama.__It has the boilerplate urgency of a TV movie that has been blessed with a high-end cast.__However you take its politics, the film upholds a dreary tradition of simplifying and sentimentalizing matters of serious social concern, and dumbing down issues that call for clarity and creative thinking.
"October Baby" looks and feels like a Lifetime movie waiting not to happen.__The odds that this has happened in the real world approach those of being struck by lightning and eaten by a shark at the same time. With a winning lottery ticket tucked in your swimsuit.__[An] earnest, faith-based drama, which lacks sufficient entertainment value to make its message go down more palatably.__Trafficking in 2-D morality and unlikely to be seen by the unconverted, "October Baby" would have been better off as a bumper sticker.__"October Baby" doesn't even meet the standards of decent propaganda. It is, in fact, indecent propaganda.__"October Baby" may be well-intentioned, but it's as obvious and inert as a spoonful of mashed potatoes.__Extended scenes are dominated by heavy dialogue, while the lighter moments are relegated to montages of prancing across a beach, for example, which simply aren't that effective at buoying the drama.__Like the bloodied placards brandished by demonstrators outside women's health clinics, the film communicates in the language of guilt and fear.__The closer Hannah gets to her goal, the more insistent the sermonizing becomes. By the time she confronts the woman who rejected her (a careerist lawyer), we are neck-deep in Lifetime TV bathos.__A film whose poignancy is hard to deny whatever side of the abortion debate you fall on.__Directors Andrew and Jon Erwin, who also contributed to the story, rarely let their film get didactic, instead going for a more low-key approach.__Newcomer Rachel Hendrix grabs attention and sustains sympathy as a lovely yet troubled 19-year-old student determined to unlock the secrets of her past.__This isn't a movie; this is propaganda for the already converted.__The film as a whole is amateurish and ungainly, can't find a consistent tone, is too long, is overladen with music that tries to paraphrase the story and is photographed with too many beauty shots that slow the progress.__A slick piece of pro-life propaganda, it has relatively luxe production values, painfully earnest performances, and a drippy "inspirational" score.__None__None__None__None__None
This horror movie from Warner Bros. is nothing special, but it's nice to see a modest genre entertainment buoyed by a major studio's resources.__The entity is a ghostly presence amid an even ghostlier absence. This is truly distressed real estate.__Something lacking either body heat or visceral suspense.__For casual viewers desiring a few scares, some suspense and a sustained sense of dread and malevolence, you could do worse.__Lights flicker; soap and cactuses blacken; claw marks appear; icky molds gather like hornet nests.__Might give you a restless night, but only because you fell asleep in the theater.__The Apparition is not a great or even good haunted-house movie, but it does have the advantage of a memorable setting.__The movie loses goodwill early on by killing an adorable dog, resulting in a lack of an identification point, since the canine has better intuition than the humans.__Mild scares and a go-nowhere climax haunt this suburbs-set debut.__If you listen closely enough while things go bump in the night during The Apparition, you might also hear the scraping of barrel bottoms.__It's a potentially creepy setting that would give an innovative director a chance to do a lot with a little. Unfortunately, Lincoln isn't one of those.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
As the brutality ramps up, and the story gains real consequence, for some reason, we actually laugh harder. Goon is a comedy, often a very funny one, but you might be hesitant to call it that once you've actually seen it.__[Scott] is reason enough to see the film, which otherwise is a by-the-book sports comedy.__The movie's unlikely sincerity can't completely offset its ugliness for less bloodthirsty viewers, but it helps, and it does smooth over some narrative rough edges.__The movie is harsh, nasty and vulgar like you wouldn't believe. And often, it's hilarious.__It's an underdog story that doesn't take itself too seriously, tender as a bruise and about as blue.__George Roy Hill's classic Slap Shot may still hold the title as the quintessential hockey comedy, but Goon certainly deserves to be mentioned in its company, juggling charm and grit and raunch and bloody teeth with assuredness and aplomb.__All it wants is slapstick violence and "Slap Shot" profanity. And it delivers both - albeit not much else.__What's somewhat surprising is you don't have to give a hoot about hockey to enjoy the movie. This is just a guy living his dream: Hitting people.__"Goon" easily takes the title of second-best hockey comedy I've ever seen.__Scott isn't bad: He sells the comedy of his character's ingrained politeness as much as the aggression. But "Goon" feels like a movie starring a gimmick, not a person.__The fact that a movie as harsh and despicable as "Goon" can be promoted as a comedy says terrible things about the state of the American film industry.__Behind the film's brass knuckles are tender fingers.__It's made with affection both for the ritual of hockey fights and the strain of sports movies that care more about wisecracks and pranks than winning the big game.__[Scott is] a talented actor, and it's worth checking out his new dramedy just to get a sense of his wide-ranging skills.__It's the rare hockey movie to approach violence head-on, without hectoring or hand-wringing, as an essential element of the sport, not some inhumane sideshow.__The best thing about "Goon" is not the hockey action, or who wins and who loses. It's Doug's rags-to-riches story.__When Seann William Scott uses his fists, he's a star.__Seann William Scott is the best comic Neanderthal in Hollywood, and he's found the perfect story in this fictionalized adaptation of a memoir by minor-league hockey brawler Doug Smith.__For a movie about ragged, trash-talking thugs beating the crap out of each other on the ice, Goon is surprisingly sweet.__Goon prevails where other sports-film farces fail thanks to Scott's winning, unwinking performance; Liev Schreiber's spot-on turn as a wizened, clock-punching rink assassin; and a pucked-up love of a bloody game.
My only complaint about The Raid is that it ended.__For now, count 'The Raid' alongside the likes of Peter Jackson's 'Bad Taste' or Guillermo del Toro's 'Mimic': a talented young filmmaker flexing his muscles, stating his intent, and promising better things in the future.__The movie gets a little slow when it settles down for some routine dialogue or plot development, but it's never more than a couple minutes before break time is over and it's back to the insane fighting stunts.__"The Raid: Redemption" is built on shaky and blood-soaked ground, but if towering technique is all you want from an action movie, then yippee-ki-yay.__Evans doesn't bother much with story or character development, instead making his film a kind of brutal ballet.__The movie is a gory free-for-all, a horror film dressed up as an action film, and it's as pure a shot of adrenaline as any Tarantino fan could wish for.__Because Welsh-born director Gareth Evans has an especially good understanding of how to choreograph and stage the fight scenes, this comes across as a viscerally enjoyable experience.__"The Raid: Redemption" is sheer action ecstasy.__Raw, rough and relentless, it just keeps coming at you.__The film is a sort of high-speed demolition derby except with human actors. It is 100 percent highly concentrated whoop-ass, and it is sensational.__As midnight-movie mash-ups go, it's pretty amazing.__The Raid, about as pure an action film as you're ever likely to see, wants to have its cake and eat it, too. It does.__Extraordinary stunt and fight work and nonstop excitement, but a warning to those who are at all squeamish: this may be the most violent movie I've ever seen.__The entire thing is so vague, at times it feels like a sequel to a movie we never saw; surely, there's something we're missing here, right, some backstory we're supposed to have?__After too many bloated Hollywood spectacles, the joltingly energetic The Raid: Redemption feels like an action film distilled to its essence.__The action is brutal, bloody and virtually nonstop in this adrenaline-packed riff on "Assault on Precinct 13.''__The hardest-working guy on this film had to be the foley artist, the technician responsible for figuring out what it sounds like to have both knees and elbows snapped, in rapid succession.__A slam-bang, knock-your-socks-off action bonanza with some of the most peerlessly shot, performed and choreographed fight sequences you're likely to see on screen.__Listen, just watch the doggone movie.__It's claustrophobic, tense, ultraviolent -- and fun.
Plaza and Duplass are enormously watchable, and there's a sweet sadness in the movie's focus on lost dreams and missed chances, and the truism that we all long for a time machine every once in a while.__Safety Not Guaranteed is droll and hilarious, but there isn't a cheap laugh in it, and the ending is so perfect it sends you soaring.__"Safety" can't sustain its own offbeat energy. By the end, even Aubrey Plaza would roll her eyes at it.__"Safety Not Guaranteed" is eccentric enough to get mistaken for an uplifting fantasy, but it's Plaza who belongs in the penthouse.__Neatly, the script embarks on one journey while dangling the possibility of another: the prospect of taking a sudden leap from comic reality into the realm of pure imagination.__"Safety Not Guaranteed" is most vibrant and vital at its edges, in the way that the characters interact with each other while waiting for something to happen.__It's brisk and assured and never begs the audience's indulgence. No time is wasted. The movie is, at every moment, either funny or pushing the story forward, or both.__The film is modest but skillful and heartfelt, spiced just so by Plaza and company.__Safety Not Guaranteed casts an enchanting spell from its opening scene.__Expectedly funny but unexpectedly touching, too.__A confident, quick-witted romantic comedy that is a giddy joy from start to finish.__A pleasantly ramshackle affair balanced uniquely between the crass and the sweet.__The film almost spirals out of control when some overtly conceptual elements are introduced to the plot, but there's enough conviction in the performances to keep them tolerable.__A charming movie that blends comedy, romance and science fiction -- not necessarily the most obvious combination of genres, but one that director Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly manage with assured ease.__Safety Not Guaranteed rewards those willing to ditch cynicism for a playful world where anything is possible.__"Safety Not Guaranteed" not only has dialogue that's about something, but characters who have some depth and dimension.__"Charming" and "sweet" are two words that can be applied to this movie, which is considerably gentler than the R-rating might imply.__A slight, wistful comedy that, at least up to the ambitious but unsatisfying final scenes, combines sci-fi and rom-com to pleasing effect.__Connolly ... goes beyond indie cliches to understand these characters, find their humanity and make us feel for them.__Because nothing plays out as anticipated, this off-balance project comes fully alive on screen in a way a written summary can't capture.
Bully is less a checklist plan for eliminating abusive behavior than an emotionally powerful wake-up call for a society too long in denial.__Bully" is smart and compassionate about the pain of its wounded subjects and the frustration felt by their parents, seemingly abandoned by the system. What the powerful film lacks is insight into bullying.__Hirsch seldom gets face time with any bullies or their parents, and he tends to ignore the complicated social and psychological patterns that feed the problem.__For a film that understandably only scratches the surface of its topic, Bully carries a devastating emotional punch.__It would have been nice if the film had reflected its title a bit more and looked at the bullies themselves - what drives one kid to torture another? Is it a reaction to home life, is it fear, is it innate awfulness?__"Bully" is a good start to a necessary conversation, but its loving voice is likely to be drowned out by haters who hide their own wounded hearts behind Internet pseudonyms and broadcast microphones.__"Bully" presents so many devastating moments that it's hard to pick the most powerful one.__"Bully" doesn't need research or great filmmaking or narrative focus, per se. It needs only the shaming power of its relentlessness and a young audience open to sharing in that shame.__A deeply moving but highly selective look at the effects of bullying on children and teenagers.__The best Hirsch's film can do, in the end, is remind us that bullying means more than we admit, and its effects aren't always immediately clear, even to loved ones.__Heartbreaking as these stories are, "Bully" is too narrow in scope to be anything approaching definitive. Most notably absent from the film are the bullies themselves.__Bully doesn't offer solutions, it raises awareness, and does so remarkably well.__We feel sympathy for the victims, and their parents or friends, but the film helplessly seems to treat bullying as a problem without a solution.__It presents a dramatic case for creating supportive communities that will stand up to those being bullied in the world. Now the onus is on all of us to play our part in making it happen.__Tackles this headline-heavy topic by mixing moments of raw emotional power with intervals of somewhat suspect manipulation.__Hirsch's documentary truly shocks by the two sets of outrageous bureaucrats it exposes: one cowers on-screen, and the other hides in the offices of the MPAA, America's movie censor.__There's no doubt 'Bully' should be required viewing in every classroom in America__What Bully does is offer viewers the potential to connect a growing network of like-minded people, and does so with elegant storytelling.__This is the kind of subject matter that can be enraging or moving in the hands of the right director, but Hirsch fails to connect with either the heart or the head.__The best social documents on film do more than show you what's wrong in the world - they make it personal. Bully does that with a passion.
____Cavill is no substitute for Van Damme, whose self-critical performance gave the earlier movie much of its heft__The script throws around phrases like "intel," "terrorist" and "rogue operative," but as time bombs go, the briefcase-versus-loved-ones ultimatum barely ticks.__Charging $10 for this movie is criminal; vouchers and letters of apology should be handed out at the exit for those stalwart viewers who stick it out to the end.__A catastrophe worth noting only for the presence of its name cast.__Defined by needless, frenetic exertion in lieu of anything resembling inspiration.__Apes The Bourne Identity so slavishly yet so boringly it winds up with no identity at all.__This isn't great cinema, or even a movie you'll remember four hours later, but as stupid thrill rides go, it's smart enough to show you a good time.__It all boils down to a series of riotously extended showdowns between Cavill and Weaver...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
______At 85 minutes, it's a tight, sharp achievement, yet one of the things I love about it is simple: It moves to a relaxed rhythm, in sync with its slightly otherworldly subject.__The search for a long-lost pop icon has an unexpected payoff.__[A] moving, lyrical account ...__It starts as a bittersweet parable about the cruelty of commerce, but the wonder of "Searching for Sugar Man" will not soon slip away.__Director Malik Bendjelloul's engaging, cleverly structured documentary about the legendary folk singer Rodriguez is shaped like a mystery.__You watch "Searching for Sugar Man" at first fascinated by the mystery - what happened to Rodriguez? Where did he go? Then you become infuriated by its revelations of financial injustice.__If you like music, a good mystery or, better yet, a combination of both, you won't be disappointed.__An electrifying illustration of music's power to inspire and change lives on both sides of the footlights.__Submitted for your approval: one Sixto Rodriguez, a Mexican-American singer/songwriter whom Rod Serling would surely embrace, in or out of the Twilight Zone.__Beautiful and revelatory, Searching for Sugar Man also incorporates huge chunks of Rodriguez's music.__A rock documentary that goes way behind the music to tell a story that seems pure urban legend.__Here's the rare music documentary in which the narrative is more interesting than the songs.__Bendjelloul mixes modern footage of Detroit with archival and animated images, and the shots of Rodriguez marching through his home turf help viewers understand what makes him tick.__I hope you're able to see this film. You deserve to. And yes, it exists because we need for it to.__This is a real-life fairy tale with a remarkably happy ending.__A pleasing fix, Searching for Sugar Man is a lost-and-found film about pursuits - one of them abandoned, and one not.__The movie is neatly structured, and Rodriguez turns out to be an interesting guy. He's worth getting to know, even if his music isn't.
Seriously, if this is the best promotion of itself that the free market can manage, it really would benefit from the help of a Ministry of Culture or something.__Director John Putch struggles to find balance or generate a single spark from the clunky mix of romance, political diatribe and thriller.__The producers are going to have to hire a better director if they want moviegoers to be curious enough about this Galt guy to buy a ticket for the presumptive third and final chapter.__It's consistent with its predecessor as a somewhat awkward translation of Ayn Rand's 1957 novel to our current era, handled with bland telepic-style competency.__A disaster as a film, Atlas also is laughable in its presentation of Rand's ideology.__If the novel Atlas Shrugged is ultimate libertarian porn, then the first two installments of the screen adaptation are soggy softcore.__The people behind the Atlas Shrugged series of films have things they want to tell you, and just to make sure that you know what they are, the movies tell you, and tell you, and then tell you again.__Proving the theorem from Todd Solondz's Palindromes that different actors can play the same role without losing much continuity, Samantha Mathis plays Dagny with all the lifelessness Taylor Schilling brought to the original role.__I didn't hate this movie. The first one was far worse -- mercifully, the cast and director have all been replaced.__"Atlas Shrugged: Part II" is political economy written with crayon.__Rather than refresh the cast with new actors, the producers would have done better to just digitally reanimate Patricia Neal and Gary Cooper, the stars of the 1949 adaptation of Rand's The Fountainhead.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
FRANK & ROBOT is a poignant tale of man and machine__Ultimately, it feels as though the filmmakers have settled for the soft option one too many times, and the result is a pleasant but unmemorable watch.__"Robot & Frank" hits all the right notes - romantic, fantastic, tragic and sweet.__There's a warm and poignant interplay between the co-stars.__Langella ... is tremendous.__It may not seem like an even playing field pitting an actor as powerfully intense as Frank Langella opposite a robot, but that's the game plan behind the waywardly endearing, slightly futuristic fantasy Robot & Frank.__Much of Robot & Frank is (frankly) resistible, including the climactic narrative twist, but there is also a likeable oddness that transcends the sentimental contrivance.__An endearing movie about a human and his mechanical new buddy.__Just about the time that Robot starts to grow on his curmudgeonly client, so may this movie -- a sci-fi fantasia that's surprisingly sweet and old-fashioned -- win over any skeptics.__Turns out to be a hard, funny and realistic movie about the future.__Charming, playful and sly, it makes us believe that a serene automaton and a snappish human being can be best friends forever.__The key to making all of this come together is Langella, who effortlessly conveys the complexity of Frank's anger and confusion even when playing a scene for laughs.__A small, sweet character study that affords Frank Langella another opportunity to shine.__"Robot & Frank" is the sort of undernourished, underpopulated production that indie fans must all too frequently settle for. It's a theatrical feature hell bent for home video.__"Robot & Frank" isn't sure whether it's a comedy or drama, buddy movie or sci-fi fantasy, family melodrama or social satire.__[T]he movie in general is undercut by the crime high jinks.__A gentle comedy that goes far deeper than its cyber Odd Couple setup implies.__This is a framework that could have benefitted from more irony and complexity, especially with the resources of Langella, but at the end, I felt the movie was too easily satisfied.__Sentimental high-concept fluff that works.__This is Langella's show, and although the story seems slight and straightforward, Christopher D. Ford's screenplay finds more complicated shades of emotion for the veteran actor to explore by the end.
________This potentially aggravating comedy remains sweet, smart and very enjoyable.__The give and take here feels completely real, and each character is likable while also flawed and vulnerable.__To its credit, "Celeste and Jesse Forever" wants to be more than a formulaic farce. It succeeds to the extent that the neighbors keep up with Jones.__A different kind of romantic comedy: one that starts at the end and tries to make sense of itself.__Tries to blend chick flick staples with bro humor but never quite gets the mix right.__It's supposed to exemplify witty, edgy, indie comedy. But "Celeste and Jesse Forever" turns out to be a formula movie ...__Jones and co-star Andy Samberg are an agreeable pair, but nothing about Celeste or Jesse would make you want to spend an evening with them, much less eternity.__How delightfully funny Jones is.__The movie feels lived in by its characters and its makers, which is more than you can say for most romantic comedies, indie or otherwise.__Yes, the characters are impossibly beautiful and hip, but beyond that, they seem real.__The tone established by director Lee Toland Krieger is flippant when it needs to be, ironic when it needs to be, playful when it needs to be, and serious when it needs to be.__This is a "personal" movie in a typically impersonal genre. And it gets at the way women, newly arrived on the dating scene and all their defenses down, can be stupefied by men.__Yet one more of a series of summer films in which attractive, ambitious young women are punished for not accepting the man-children in their lives despite their torn-teddy-bear flaws.__Both old-fashioned and modern, both funny and melancholic, the witty, heartfelt "Celeste and Jesse Forever" is populated by moments that at first appear all too familiar, then turn out to surprise you.__This romantic comedy is ambitious and thoughtful, asking us to consider what makes a really good marriage, yet it's based on a sort of narrative sleight of hand.__Underneath it is an honest concern about how to learn to treat people well and kindly after the end. Or to get to an ending, or a new beginning, in the first place.
Almost miraculously, the disparate elements add up to an improbably entertaining hybrid.__A sumptuous if rather soulless love story.__Romance king Yash Chopra delivers a swoon-worthy Bollywood love story.__"Jab Tak Hai Jaan" serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra.__Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The grim, grey-hued result is about as far from contemporary drag chic as it's possible to get - appropriate for the subject matter, perhaps, but hardly the stuff of satisfying cinema.__The film surrounding the performance is not always as strong, but the centre holds, and magnificently so.__Albert is at the heart of it all and we see her through her own prism of vulnerability, resulting in a very human story about the search for love, acceptance and understanding of the self.__A movie that, like its title character, never quite dares to let itself discover what it really wants to be.__What you feel, watching Close, is not that you are watching gender being bent into new, absorbing shapes but that you might as well have stayed home and leafed through a book on Magritte.__[A] strange, sad, mesmerizing little movie.__"Albert Nobbs" is a film of great texture and tenderness, and the actors are a joy to behold.__[It] sneaks up on the audience with the quiet discretion of the enigmatic protagonist at its center. And, like him, it contains multitudes beneath its prim surface.__[A] funny, sorrowful, richly layered and tremendously moving film.__Characters as out of touch and desperate as Albert Nobbs awaken an instinctive doubt and distrust in an audience.__Rodrigo Garcia [is] known for his female ensemble dramas but demonstrates no particular affinity for this material.__It's a career-crowning role for Glenn Close. Too bad the film is such a drag.__Notable performances by Glenn Close and Janet McTeer mark this carefully made but muted story of women passing as men in 19th-century Dublin.__Men in drag are usually played for laughs. Women passing as men? Expect a tragic twist.__It's a small, gentle film with wistful sadness peeking around its corners, and when it's over you may feel as if you want a little more, as if we're not much closer to understanding Albert than we were at the beginning.__As an experiment in Academy Award psychology, "Albert Nobbs" is fascinating. As drama? It is, forgive us, a drag.__Close's performance as this poor, wounded fellow resonates with depth and poignancy.__There's an ache of regret that sets "Albert Nobbs'' apart. Everyone here yearns for what they can't get.__This is a costume drama where the costume is the drama.__With its unpredictable sexual politics and quirky little hero/heroine Albert Nobbs has the edge of quinine, a peculiar taste that won't entice everyone but worked for me.

Quirky deaf man gets entangled in love triangle in poignant Bollywood romantic comedy.__Hopping nimbly among three distinct timeframes, helmer Basu deconstructs the film's sentimental thrust to stress his hero's in-the-moment ingenuity.__Despite a hard-working cast, a lush score, exotic location shooting and scattered warmth, "Barfi!" is ultimately more endurance test than entertainment.__Against your will, you may even shed a tear.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

But the film winds up being a collection of striking visuals without any emotional heft.__"Samsara" is a ravishing visual experience, but it carries a message that at least some viewers will find less than compelling.__The result is like an issue of National Geographic gone mad.__Samsara stares at Asian temples, African tribesmen, and chickens bound for slaughter with the same blank eye.__A world of wonders without a guide or an agenda, "Samsara" rewards a leap of faith.__Fricke's Super 70 Panavision camera gives us ravishing images without comment, allowing us to infer whatever connections we choose.__Any sincerity inherent in the project is overwhelmed by the manufactured awe of its godawful New Age score.__"Samsara" is gorgeous. And sometimes, depending on expectations, looks are enough.__Filmed over five years, in locations in 25 countries, it is the kind of experience you simply sink into.__I'm not convinced that Fricke's movies are much more than exalted travelogues, but you certainly feel as if you've been somewhere after you've seen one of them.__The makers of "Samsara" want to free our minds, but their technique makes us their prisoners more often than not.__There may be no words within "Samsara," a visually startling work of global cinematography. But there is a narrative, one by which the movie undermines itself.__Fricke's film reminds us there's an inspiring world out there, but his approach is badly in need of creative rebirth.
It wants audiences to know it's in on the joke though it's not always apparent that there even is a joke in the first place.__Progress acknowledges cliches but has little interest in actually subverting them, instead growing more predictable and sentimental as it goes along.__It never gives us a character we truly care about, or a consistent reason for watching.__Girl in Progress seems like a work in progress.__The direction ... doesn't do justice to the fairly novel concept of a young woman consciously constructing her own coming-of-age scenario.__A comedy-drama that veers between silly and serious but can't reconcile the opposing tones.__Smart girls do stupid things, there's no doubt about it. But Ansiedad's bad behavior is supposed to be both faux and earnest, a premise that doesn't jell.__Does it pull out all the melodramatic stops toward the end? Does it resolve its many climactic crises too neatly and too sweetly? Yes on both counts. But, then again, what did you expect?__A well-done, conscientious and funny little film that recalls "Clueless," only with more heart.__The mystery of Eva Mendes' slow-simmering career continues.__The lack of connective tissue and more explicitly drawn parallels between the storylines drags the pic down to the level of a basic TV series.__Attention, women! You should never sleep with a man whose only attribute is that you want to sleep with him. I should write a book of my own.__This inauthentic teen tale, with its cosmetically softened edges, serves neither the young people nor the Mendes fans for whom it might be intended.__This is being marketed as an ideal film for moms and daughters to see together on Mother's Day weekend. A long, awkward brunch sounds more fun -- and more truthful.__A corny, overwritten movie made by a director with nothing to say.__... when Girl in Progress works, it's a thoughtful trip -- no matter how broad some of its missteps are...__Unconvincing, flawed matriarch Mendes and junior showboat Ramirez appear to be acting in entirely different movies.__Riggen's lethargic direction, which favors a monotonous procession of static, centrally framed compositions, doesn't help matters in the slightest.__The movie goes soft. But it has the unpretentious energy and charm of a good YA girls' novel.__None
The exquisite nigiri slices gleam with freshness, and you do learn about the component parts to the perfect serving of sea eel or gizzard shad.__It's torture to watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi -- if you are on an empty stomach.__By the time this graceful film is over you understand why Japan has declared the bald, bespectacled Jiro a national treasure. Even if you've never tasted sushi, the man's singleness of purpose will inspire you.__Gelb apparently understood that his subject was itself so taking that he wouldn't need filmic embellishments to keep his viewers alert.__Obsessive, we were saying? Oh my, yes, and that's what makes the film so compelling.__This documentary strikes a balance between storytelling and food porn that's hard to come by in foodie flicks. Like a proper sushi meal, "Jiro" left me feeling sated, not stuffed.__The most interesting moments, however, belong not to the chef but to those who labor in his shadow.__As exhausting as Jiro may be, he's also inspiring.__Would you be willing to massage an octopus for 45 minutes, until its flesh possesses just the right amount of chewability? Jiro is.__I really wish Tokyo were closer.__As a documentary about world-class sushi, this film is definitive. It runs only 81 minutes, but the subject is finite.__A case study in the phenomenon of mastery.__At the age of 85, the subject of this fascinating documentary not only dreams of sushi but still drives himself to make it better.__Overall, this is a pleasant and often enlightening journey.__Jiro Dreams of Sushi isn't just a film for foodies, or Japanophiles. It's a meditation on work, on finding one's path in life, and then walking it with singular purpose.__Director David Gelb pulls back the curtain on the kitchen rituals of sushi, inviting us to experience the savory-smooth sensation of ''umami,'' roughly translated as ''Ahhh!''__A profile of a celebrity chef, a quick cultural immersion and many mouth-watering montages of food preparation in one package.__"Jiro Dreams of Sushi"is as elegant and tasty as the splendid sushi prepared by the man in the title, and that is saying a lot__It is as much a family saga as a visit to sushi nirvana, and that adds an unexpected and satisfying narrative to this visual stunner.__It's beautifully photographed and explained at every stage from market to table, a foodie's dream night at the movies. The gentle shaping of the fish and sushi could lull you into a trance. A hungry trance.
Sometimes it's worth surrendering to cinematic enchantments, and Ruby Sparks makes a pretty good case for its own magic.__Sure it's been done before -- man brings ideal woman to life -- but not quite like Ruby Sparks. And that sets this film up to be a smart and romantic low-key comedy that goes beyond expectations.__If the result feels like a Pinocchio story that spends too much time with Geppetto, or a takedown of narcissism that never breaks free of what it's critiquing, Dano nonetheless makes Calvin compelling company.__Kazan winds up indulging in the very wish-fulfillment she initially sets out to deconstruct.__Ruby Sparks flirts with preciousness and has less fun with its premise than it could have, but that's because it's actually a gently touching metaphorical drama about the real essence of love.__Ruby Sparks might have been more fun if Cal were written to be expansive instead of a worrywart in the middle-aged Matthew Broderick mode.__Kazan's script is observant about how we try to control relationships - making this a smart, modern movie. And how often can you say that about a romcom?__Sneaks up on you with deep questions, discomfiting insights and more emotional punch than you may expect.__Ruby Sparks opts for a seemingly darker but ultimately easier resolution, one that involves magic and fantasy and the sort of neat, happily-ever-after finales that only exist in movies.__"Ruby Sparks" is a curveball delight, the work of serious-minded jokers.__Kazan carries the film with a disarmingly sweet performance.__The meta-fiction concept of characters interacting with their creator is hardly original, but it's neatly packaged here by Kazan herself, who wrote the script for this clever little charmer.__"Ruby Sparks" is a film about the wonder of, and the limits of, magic. Believe and enjoy.__Sparklingly entertaining.__There are moments in this movie that are mind-bendingly funny, and that fill the viewer with the thrill of discovering great new talent.__What starts off as a sunny daydream, a shot of whimsy and mild-mannered magical realism, turns into something more serious, and seriously reflective. Satisfyingly so.__Kazan isn't beautiful. She's not even pretty, at least not in any conventional way. But she's enormously attractive, and the camera can't get enough of that heart-shaped face and those bouncing bangs.__So much more satisfying than the cut-rate romantic comedy that it could have been.__Envision (500) Days of Summer as retold by Charlie Kaufman and you won't be far off.__Maybe it'll give you something to think about as you Facebook stalk that cute girl you just met for coffee.
It's priceless.__Seriously, if this was the American Dream, couldn't we have come up with something better?__Although it's a guilty pleasure, "The Queen of Versailles" is artful enough that both the prosecution and the defense could invoke it when the peasants cry "Off with their heads!"__This rags-to-riches-to-almost-rags-again queen has an endearing knack for looking on the bright side. You find yourself, by the end, wishing her well.__"The Queen of Versailles" is funny, sad, infuriating, instructive. It's the American Dream inflated to ridiculous extremes, until it bursts.__More than a social morality tale, this is a character study, with the title well chosen.__"The Queen of Versailles" ought to be required viewing for anyone who blames the rich for yanking the rug out from under America's economy.__By the end, the movie has pulled off a small miracle: You become absorbed in the lives of these people for who they are and not what they own.__What I left with was not hatred. I disapprove of the values they represent, but I also find them fascinating and just slightly lovable.__"The Queen of Versailles" turns out to be a portrait -- appalling, absorbing and improbably affecting -- of how, even within a system seemingly designed to ensure that the rich get richer, sometimes the rich get poorer.__Through a clear lens unclouded by politics or blame, it offers insight into the hazardous American practice of living beyond our means.__There's more going on here than classist derision, and the filmmaker uses her footage to try to sort out her feelings.__The Queen of Versailles combines the voyeuristic thrills of reality TV with the soul-revealing artistry of great portraiture and the head-shaking revelations of solid investigative reporting.__"The Queen of Versailles" is beautifully constructed and frequently uproarious.__The paradox of wealth without refinement remains unexamined but emerges as a metaphor for the American Dream itself.__Dig into your popcorn, and get ready for some snide schadenfreude.__The Siegels make the Kardashians and Donald Trump look like tasteful pikers when it comes to egregiously conspicuous consumption, sheer hubris and utter refusal to take responsibility for their actions.__Director Lauren Greenfield finds the pathos in an ultra-wealthy couple who willingly mortgaged their own future.__Director Lauren Greenfield's timing turned out to be extraordinarily fortuitous in its depiction of how the mighty also fall, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.__The Queen of Versailles is the lucky case of a documentary where life intervenes and deepens the film in completely unexpected ways.
Salman Khan dazzles in rollicking -- and romantic -- Indian action thriller.__Result boasts some excellent action sequences, most performed by megastar Salman Khan, and indeed is generally more effective in fight scenes than in hearts-and-flowers mode.__Tiger and Zoya both make good kung fu street fighters, but as spies they're unconvincing, and as lovers they're cookie-cutter bland.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This self-deprecating comedy would make both Larry David and Louis C.K. proud,__From start to finish, his character, called Matt Pandamiglio, is all by his lonesome -- reaching out of the fog. He's a funny fog person.__The film acts as both a diary of a sidewinding comic stylist finding his style, almost by accident, and a reminder to all post-collegiate boyfriends and girlfriends that "OK" probably isn't good enough for either party.__This is a movie for anyone who's ever been unsure, and surely that's everyone.__Notwithstanding its storytelling stumbles, "Sleepwalk With Me" points in a positive direction for this likable comedian's career.__A smart, neurotic slice-of-life comedy about a stand-up comic with confidence issues, commitment issues, and career issues.__Birbiglia's pleasingly nasal delivery and agreeable presence holds it together.__I liked Sleepwalk With Me-just not nearly as much as I would've liked to have liked it.__This sharp romantic comedy began as a one-man show, and you can tell: the hero's voice-over narration wraps around the entire movie, and the scenes are mainly verbal.__"Sleepwalk With Me's" transition from stage to screen primarily works because Birbiglia continues to carry the weight.__It all adds up to a fine, funny exercise in disheveled self-deprecation: a self-portrait of a guy who can't control a major portion of his life.__Birbiglia proves to be as engaging a presence on the screen as he has been all these years onstage and over the radio waves.__The semi-autobiographical tale is appealingly low-key and alternately funny and melancholy, informed by Birbiglia's casual delivery.__Is there reason to be concerned that so much popular culture is about young men not wanting to become adults? Probably. And yet "Sleepwalk With Me" makes the subject palatable, funny and maybe even touching.__"Sleepwalk With Me" traps Birbiglia inside his own head. He desperately needs a movie or cable series that wakes him up and sets his material loose on the outside world.__"Sleepwalk With Me" is the perfect movie for fans of "The Daily Show" who actually stick around for the second-half interview.__It is a likable, warm film that brings a welcome reassurance: Even if you fail spectacularly as a comedian or as a human being, it really can turn out OK in the end.__I like this movie. More important, I like Mike Birbiglia in it. Whether he has a future in stand-up I cannot say, but he has a future as a monologist and actor.__Sleepwalk is oddly soothing, like a cup of camomile tea before bedtime.__A thoughtful adaptation of Birbiglia's hit one-man, off-Broadway show.
Although it raises timeless questions about life and loss, and timely ones about mentorship and multiculturalism, "Monsieur Lazhar" would rather teach than preach.__A gentle film can still be searing in its effect on an audience, something that "Monsieur Lazhar" proves emphatically.__With a few folds, this story could have made a script for John Barrymore, like Topaze, or for Chaplin.__You could almost describe 'Monsieur Lazhar' as a morality tale, but it's more thought-provoking than debate-provoking.__A sad, reflective study of the possibilities, and the impossibilities, inherent in the teacher-student relationship.__"Monsieur Lazhar" is good. Really good.__"Monsieur Lazhar" is a complex, multilayered tale that reveals new meanings as it introduces each new character.__The film is rich in naturalistic, tossed-off details.__A standard liberal tale about an inspirational teacher gradually deepens into a quiet study of how grief works its way through a community.__It's all a bit neat. But whatever the film's limitations, it's certainly engaging to watch.__Its purpose is to present us with a situation, explore the people involved and show us a man who is dealing with his own deep hurts.__How do we get past tragedy? Together.__What could be didactic is rendered life-size and indelible, even with the cards that Falardeau has carefully stacked.__Fellag, an Algerian comedian and humor writer, anchors the film as the ineffable Bachir, a man who's so private that even the third-act revelation of his back story doesn't fully explain his motivations to us (nor would we want it to).__Canada's foreign-language submission is a searing classroom drama about grief that should be an Oscar front-runner.__The French-Canadian film Monsieur Lazhar has one of the most powerful openings I've ever seen in a movie.__The movie's tonic lack of sentimentality binds the various griefs together into something moving.__An understated story of coping with emotional blows that offers a compelling portrait of a decent man.__Like a dedicated teacher, this is a film that stays with you.__Fellag, a comedian and himself an exile from Algeria, makes Lazhar both a sensitive and an amusing figure. And the kids are just terrific, especially Emilien Neron as a boy who carries the guilt of the whole school on his shoulders.
At the last... Footnote is so intelligently and deftly made that we are glad it exists.__"Footnote" deals with ambition, isolation, the dangers of too much success and the inevitable gap between generations.__Cedar mines dark humor from the humiliations of identity checks and pecking orders.__Footnote requires little knowledge of Judaism and its texts. Rather, it's about the complications of love, guilt, and rage.__Israeli writer-director Joseph Cedar's tale of two Talmudic scholars set in present-day Jerusalem, while not exactly side-splitting, is quietly riotous. And, yes, the guffaws are bittersweet.__At times, the film seems to turn into a microfiche machine, with the story's sections divided by frames thumping past us as if propelled by a researcher, eyes scanning.__A droll, deadpan satire of the professional contempt and personal rancor that breeds in any narrow field.__Footnote is a film about the nature of truth, about sacrifice, hubris, hypocrisy. It's nothing short of brilliant.__It speaks to anyone who's been on either end of a grudge or family antagonism. And it saves its best for those who have witnessed clusters of the best and brightest descend to the level of grade school kids on the playground.__It's a wryly observed little picture that plays like an anecdote deliberately separated from some larger text that's hinted at yet never fully divulged.__It's not easy to make Eliezer a sympathetic character, yet Bar-Aba's demonstration of fleeting vulnerability awakens inevitable, if equally brief, compassion.__Its energy and eccentricity assert themselves in funky graphics, imaginative camerawork and everyday moments of awkwardness and absurdity.__The film was a nominee for this year's foreign-language Oscar, and Cedar has a real grasp of how to create conflict and generate tension.__Writer/director Joseph Cedar is wise to the comedy of frustration and alert to the tragedy of hubris.__Writer and director Cedar does a great job of ratcheting up the tension by filtering the story through a simmering family rivalry.__Footnote is at its best when it gets into the cutthroat dynamics of academic competition, which are both horrifying and amusing.__This is brainy, bravura filmmaking of the highest level, a motion picture that is as difficult to pigeonhole as it is a pleasure to enjoy.__Writer-director Joseph Cedar's understanding of the many levers of academic politics helps him inject a little steel into the movie; but it's eventually overcome by the mushy father-son drama.__I've seen the film twice, gladly, and I can't wait to see what Cedar comes up with next.__In fact, it's one of the smartest and most merciless comedies to come along in a while.
If you like your movies filled with twisted humor, sexual perversion, psychological intimidation and sudden violence, "Killer Joe" is the flick for you.__Watching "Killer Joe" to the bitter end is like playing the Pick 6 lottery and getting three of the numbers right. You don't win anything, but you still think you're smarter than all those other idiots.__You will either love "Killer Joe" or run away screaming. I absorbed this NC-17 nail bomb with awestruck admiration.__[Friedkin] has retained his touch ... all these years later. And in Matthew McConaughey, he has the perfect vehicle for madness.__You end up feeling sorry for all the actors forced to humiliate themselves, except for McConaughey, whose portrayal of sadistic, manipulative evil is mesmerizing.__The movie frequently clicks as a sendup of over-the-top film-noir storytelling.__If y'all like your comedy with a Lone Star drawl and as black as Texas tea, then by all means tuck right into Killer Joe.__In the immortal words of Wayne's World: "You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hurl."__Killer Joe is twisted pulp, and the actors chew on it bravely, boldly, and with varying degrees of success.__It's as mean as a snake.__A gleeful and unapologetic descent into delicious decadence, Killer Joe is proud of what it is and never tries to be something it isn't.__That everything should go wrong is no surprise, but the wrong turns are taken so viciously -- Gershon, in particular, is appallingly treated, in closeup -- that they lead the film, adapted from the play by Tracy Letts, to the brink of abusive farce.__Like a deep-fried Twinkie at the State Fair of Texas, Killer Joe is gooey, flavorful and bad for you. Dig in.__The action and dialogue find the same squalid level in time for the climactic scene, the cruel humiliation of a central character.__Out of the muck and mire of human depravity that is "Killer Joe," something magnificent comes: a killer performance by Matthew McConaughey.__It is a tale of white trash immorality on a grand scale, of people who are ridiculous and yet dangerous, laughable but cunning, and really stupid ... yet sneaky.__The bone-crunchingly violent film has luridly entertaining moments. But by its resolution, this sleazy Southern Gothic nightmare has simply gone off the rails.__The film harks back to the low-budget chamber pieces of Friedkin's early career, and he creates a perfect storm of montage and character interplay within a confined space, which culminates in a disturbing loss of humanity.__"Killer Joe" is one hell of a movie. It left me speechless. I can't say I loved it. I can't say I hated it.__Friedkin make no attempt to soften the characters' monstrousness, and thank hell for that. This is rave and rage and purge acting.

An entirely predictable script that chugs along to the foregone loser-beats-odds conclusion.__In another era, "Crooked Arrows" might have been an after-school special, perfect to have on the TV while cleaning the house; miss a scene while you're dusting under the couch, and you'll still know exactly what's happening later.__"Crooked Arrows" gets points for its glimpses of Native American culture and history - the film's backers include the Onondaga Nation - but too many of these scenes are disappointingly static.__"Crooked Arrows" might involve two lesser-seen screen subjects - Native Americans and lacrosse - but it still can't break free of the usual underdog sports picture tropes.__Routh ... does a killer Tom Cruise-in-"Jerry Maguire" homage in this swift little sports dramedy.__A millennial brace of lacrosse action propels Crooked Arrows through a thicket of cliches liberally planted in its path.__It's an often-awkward niche film enlivened by impressive on-field action scenes. But those can't get it beyond a predictable sports underdogs-fight-back plot.__Despite referring to the tribe as "my people," Routh is wholly miscast, yet his ill-fitting presence is part and parcel of the plotting's general illogicality.__A by-the-numbers triumph-of-the-underdog flick.__The plucky underdog Native American lacrosse movie I never knew I wanted.__While the plot is trite, the lacrosse action is right. The cameras capture the speed, agility and physical nature of the sport.__The lacrosse angle aside, "Crooked Arrows" seems less interested in breaking ground than in following a path that has been trod a thousand times before.__The story is unique and engaging enough to transcend the uplifting sports-underdog formula.__The film clearly targets a niche audience of lacrosse enthusiasts. But it also works on a broader scale, because well-executed David-vs.-Goliath sports stories like this have universal appeal.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Director Tanya Wexler plays things broadly at times, but "Hysteria" has good fun with history while coming off far more wholesome than salacious.__Its 95 minutes move along nicely, and Everett - languid as a cat in a sunbeam - makes his too-brief scenes into master classes of comedy.__As a sex-education comedy, "Hysteria" is flaccid, forced and unfunny.__The problem with "Hysteria" is that it keeps patting itself and us on the back for knowing better.__Hysteria never gets too preachy or ponderous, and there's something in the film to educate even the most learned viewer.__The movie also makes all the right noises about female sexual liberation. But its good intentions are undermined by sniggering jokes...__A clever love story, an amusing comedy of manners, and a smart message movie.__Good vibrations all around.__It's happy to get the big facts broadly right, as long as it's allowed to have a little fun with the rest.__"Hysteria," with its period costumes and English accents, seems like a much better movie than it is.__For a light entertainment, this romantic comedy delivers an impressive amount of feminist rhetoric and historical detail.__It doesn't really know what it is. A little of this, a little of that and by the time it's done, it adds up to not much at all.__Ostensibly a story about sexual liberation, Hysteria needs a thrill worthy of its intended good vibrations.__The performances are spot on, and I especially like the spunky Gyllenhaal...__One of the smartest, funniest and most charming movies of the year.__It's as if they felt they had to work all that socially conscious stuff into the mix in order to justify the risque humor.__Hysteria is a fun fling of a movie about medical science at its shakiest. Literally.__Obviously a movie about the invention of the vibrator is going to have to approach the topic with humour, but ridiculing your main characters' psychology does not build dramatic tension.__"Hysteria," set in 1880s London, is a light comedy about a pretty dark time for the fairer sex.__Despite its titillating subject matter, Hysteria is only mildly stimulating. The final third of the story meanders during a tedious trial and clumsy speechifying.
It's comforting to watching dramatic and comic fiction regarding the things some of us actually have to deal with in life. When done right, those kinds of films are worth your time. YOUR SISTER'S SISTER happens to be one of them.__Movies that start well and end badly occur often enough, and yet even knowing that is no preparation for what happens to Your Sister's Sister.__It certainly shows that fine films don't need big budgets, capturing some sweet lightning in an arresting bottle indeed.__Romantic, funny, surprising and thoroughly involving, Your Sister's Sister is the rare film you give yourself over to completely.__There's a nice, loose-limbed improvisatory feeling to "Your Sister's Sister," a quality that identifies it as the work of artisans, not assembly-line professionals.__This is a smart, moving film that's also very, very funny.__This film should come with a warning: don't watch with a sibling. Unless you're up for some knowing elbow-digs.__Who are these people, and why are we watching them?__"Your Sister's Sister" follows the indie-cinema blueprint to the letter with one exception: One of the film's characters is a lesbian.__By the end of this graceful little emotional farce, you know these people, their hopes and their panic, and you wish them the very best.__Shelton and her cast are so skillful that before long it seems we are not moviegoers watching a screen but flies on a wall witnessing real encounters and the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.__Honest and free-spirited, this romantic comedy is filled with genuine and uncomfortable moments that can only come when a trio of talented actors ... are invited to make it up as they go along.__All three performers add both tone and, when required, a fierce volume to their interplay.__A keenly observed romance whose apparent rough-edged naturalism masks a considerable degree of craft.__No question that Shelton and her cast share a remarkable collaborative rapport.__Since it's essentially a three-character movie, it's a good thing that the characters, and the actors who play them, can hold the screen.__Effective evidence that the emotional immediacy in the halting rhythms of extemporaneous speech can often trump the art of the well-chosen word. A film that is both warmly and naturally funny as well as uncomfortable and awkward.__Shelton is too much in thrall to improvisation, and letting the actors "find" their characters.__Shelton's work here suggests that mumblecore may be finding its way out of the artistic ghetto it's placed itself in.__It's a tribute to Shelton and her cast that they've made a film about the difficulties of love, friends and family look so easy.
We can note immediately that Zilberman has the requisite gifts.__The result is a perfectly serviceable, well acted melodrama - but why so serious?______The screenplay by Seth Grossman and Israeli-American director Yaron Zilberman is old-fashioned and melodramatic but stirring in its portrait of people struggling with individual egos to produce something nobler than themselves.__[It] may not sound like a scintillatingly good time at the movies, but actually it is.__The outstanding ensemble cast keeps the story - and its accompanying emotional heft - from becoming overly baroque.__Yes, A Late Quartet is disappointing. But it's also pretty bad.__For a film that relies so heavily on the lasting power of a classical master, A Late Quartet never really converts any viewers to his church.__Walken - and Zilberman - shows us how music can utterly transport us to another place.__Engaging, intelligent, but direction doesn't quite live up to a first-rate cast.__An auspicious feature debut for a director whose sensitivity to emotional harmonies is as rewarding as his reverence for timeless, transcendent music.__The movie is haut-bourgeois to the bone, but so am I: Let's hear some chamber music and have a little laugh and a cry!__...the very definition of a character driven drama, the performances humbling in their power.__Of the cast, the standout is Walken, who gives a performance of superlative grace amid all the hectoring.__The movie doesn't resolve on a sour note, but it takes the viewer along a too-familiar set of tones.__Unless you're channeling the forgiving spirit of Casals, I'm afraid this one hits too many off notes to recommend.__Yaron Zilberman, a documentarian making his feature debut, treads a fine line between farce and drama ...__A half-glass of a movie, full of superlative performances and sublime music but empty when it comes to a story rife with melodrama and trite plot conventions.__For those willing to enter this world and pay attention, "A Late Quartet" provides distinct and uncommon satisfactions.
For all its incident, A Royal Affair is slow and picturesquely framed - more of a languorously animated coffee-table book than a gripping drama.__The film ends not on a happy note, naturally, but on a moment of hope. Love may not conquer all, but it has a power all its own.__Although the brazen lovers, bellicose ministers and backstabbing handmaidens are familiar elements, the film is so handsomely mounted that we happily endure the ride until the turning of the screws in the tragic last act.__Perhaps there's only so much to be done with a costume drama about illicit affairs and would-be coups.__What a piece of work is this historical drama.__A Royal Affair covers plenty of stately ground, all in good time.__A fascinating, stately thriller.__A crowned-heads soap opera that balances effectively between pomp and melodramatic circumstance.__A tragic love story, beautifully told.__Even appreciated simply as a little-known chapter of European history, it proves consistently engrossing, edifying and affecting.__"A Royal Affair" is an engaging and entertaining film, one that might have been great, if only the history were different.__The film moves along crisply, looks great and stimulates the brain (I am a sucker for torrid romances propelled by quotes from Rousseau and Voltaire.)__A Royal Affair is historical drama of the highest order - teeming with big ideas, and anchored by the nicely nuanced performances of Vikander and Mikkelsen.__History may not always be fun, but, at least in this case, it's fascinating.__Director Nikolaj Arcel gets outstanding performances from all three of the principals, which enlivens the whole affair considerably.__The film tells an intimate story with an enormous amount of grace.__The storytelling ... is kind of amazing.__'Affair' is disappointingly conventional, much too decorous and, at two hours-plus, sometimes just plain dull.__It does a fine job of dramatizing the pure power of ideas and the attraction of like minds. And what happens when those ideas, and that attraction, runs counter to the pleasures of the most powerful man in the land.__"A Royal Affair" is basically a good-looking set of historical Cliffs Notes.
Marley is highly watchable, finely crafted legacy preservation - and it's either a white-washed sham or awesomely shaded.__It wants to show us the man behind the famous dreads, beatific smile and durable songs of love, hope and longing. In this task it succeeds admirably.__Sprinkled with riffs, concert footage and home videos, the family-authorized documentary does what the artist usually did: When in doubt, return to the beat.__Macdonald supplies some interesting and novel details about the musician's life and art, though the movie's narrative arc and documentary methods are totally predictable.__Given the legal and logistical constraints on this long-delayed project, this lengthy movie is as comprehensive a history as Marley's fans could have hoped, but the uninitiated may not catch a fire.__Bob Marley wrote the same song about 8,000 times, and the documentary "Marley" makes sure to include each version.__This is a life story worth telling, and "Marley" does it much justice. Marley may or may not have been perfect, but he was certainly fascinating.__It's hard to imagine audiences who don't know much about the man sticking around for more than a few minutes of this. And they're the ones who need to know about him most of all.__The movie has enormous force - because it's about a genius, yes, but even more so because of the intelligence, passion and wit of the people who knew Marley.__It's exhaustive without being exhausting, an eye-opening and all-encompassing portrait that should go a long way to rescuing him from being a marijuana mascot.__Chronologically organized and voiceover-free, the movie is a 145-minute patchwork of old concert footage and talking-head interviews -- lots and lots of them -- from people who knew, loved, and worked with the reggae giant.__The enormous popularity of the transcendent reggae superstar shows no signs of abating, a situation"Marley," a moving and authoritative new documentary, takes as its mission to illustrate and explain.__Even those who know reggae star Bob Marley inside and out might be amazed by the scope, detail and beauty of "Marley"...__Stylistically unremarkable, playing it safe with structure, the film is still quietly revelatory.__The director, Kevin Macdonald, searches for clarity amid the contradictions of Marley's life and reaches no conclusions, but that's a tribute to his subject's complexity in a film of fascinating too-muchness.__A riveting two-and-a-half-hour documentary biography...__Marley celebrates the fact that its subject is still among us in the way that perhaps matters most: His music not only survives, it thrives.__This film is long. But it grabs one's senses and won't let go.__Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours, it is gripping from the start, not just because of the quality of the music, but because of Marley's magnetic, challenging personality, as well.__You see a man, flawed and imperfect, finding his way through with his music, constantly searching for his place in the world until that quest was cut tragically short.
It is easy to imagine other, darker, results after the opening accident, but Levy's film, pitched firmly as if it were the only possibility, makes it seem so.__A humane but emotionally anemic message movie whose dramatic craft doesn't live up to its good intentions.__Levy generally succeeds in creating a compelling, humanistic family drama, even if some viewers may reject the movie's final note of optimism.__In the end, it seems, this is not a story about two families, and two lands. It's a story about one family, and one world.__Levy handles with aplomb what could easily have been a messy mix of emotions and politics.__The intention here is plain - we are all human, we can all be family - but Levy weaves the mix of identity crises, cultural mingling and common ground slyly.__"The Other Son'' is played with warmth and conviction by its cast. But it's also a little pat and toothless, set in an Israel where not even the notorious border crossings seem that difficult.__Even though [Levy] executes with a light touch, it tends to feel a little simplistic given how deep-seated and persistent the Palestine-Israel conflict is.__"The Other Son" is such a disarming feat that cynics will get left at the checkpoint.__"The Other Son" is a case of good intentions overwhelming the inherent drama - quite simply, political correctness got the best of it__Ms. Levy is rescued from her maudlin, preachy tendencies by the skill and sensitivity of the actors, who turn a wobbly parable of tolerance into a graceful and touching story of real people in a surreal situation.__Transcends its switched-at-birth premise to a degree that's surprising, considering that the well-worn plot militates against surprise.__A thoughtful bridging of a cultural divide.__A parablelike melodrama with obvious symbolic meaning.__The movie is shameless and simple yet solemn at the same time.__It's hard not to feel carried along by the generously conciliatory spirit that warms The Other Son ...__This beautifully photographed drama is well-played throughout with great conscience without becoming heavy-handed.__The Other Son's setup is too contrived, carried along by conversations that are either confrontational or artificially elusive.__I wonder how this story would play out if they were both still quite young.__Ham-fisted dialogue and cliched characterizations trump genuine chemistry in The Other Son, a contrived Franco-Israeli drama about two 18-year-olds, an Israeli and a Palestinian, accidentally switched at birth.
Watching [Travis] add his kitschy touch to such a witless, faux-edgy movie can only be described as a Travis-ty.__Unfortunately Travis lacks the comedic skill and humanistic insight to make this anything more than Judd Apatow lite.__A fun, healthy, sexy comedy that pulls no punches and focuses on a realistic female friendship and the powerful dynamic that sexuality plays in our lives.__The film is worth seeing for the humor and for its high level of energy, but it falls short of being the "complete package."__Is it one for the ages? No. Is it a good time? Good enough.__The film (a) is not recommended for the prudish and (b) does not live up to its title.__The film is a wobbly attempt to follow in the stilettos of "Bridesmaids," but its tissue-sharp punch lines and undernourished characters fall woefully short.__This hot-pink and leopard-print take on a familiar formula is so energetic and self-assured that it powers past its predictability.__For a good time, don't.__The confusion in For a Good Time, Call... is delightful, the phone-sex talk sweetening the vibe.__It's the movie's affectionate portrait of female friendship, along with Miller and Graynor's loose, playful performances, that make this whole imperfect souffle rise as high as it does.__Unfortunately nothing here is very good.__It's a showcase for writing that doesn't dazzle and a story of self-discovery that reveals no new insights.__Adheres to those familiar, looping patterns of joy, rancor and revelation that everyone, in the age of Final Draft, have come to expect of a standard comic screenplay.__Boasts almost the same degree of intellectual heft, moral nuance and philosophical rigour as a sitcom.__Travis, making his feature debut, gets very likable performances out of his female stars.__Could a genuinely good, or genuinely funny, movie ever be made about two girls who operate a phone-sex line?__In a rare instance of truth in advertising, this movie actually is a good time.__[It] doesn't aspire to be more than a broad, sloppy, old-fashioned sitcom with a sexy gimmick. But it is quite funny, and at the screening I attended, the loudest laughs came from young women in the audience.__It feels like a movie you've seen already - and it was better the first time around.
Take This Waltz is a Remarkable, Offbeat Love Story__A hard-headed, generous film about love.__Polley (who's been an actress herself) never judges these people she's created. Instead, she depicts the giddy, fleeting and illusory nature of new love, and lets us get caught up in it, too.__No one's a cliche; no one speaks dialogue the viewer could have muttered a beat or two ahead of the movie; no one hews to a mode of behavior fabricated to explain away his or her irrational behavior.__[It] often feels thin and self-conscious.__Williams lives and breathes her role, Kirby is charming and real, and you actually start to ache and empathize with Rogen - the emptiness and heartache he conveys when Lou and Margot finally thrash things out is crushing.__Both the small moments and the end product of Waltz are quietly sublime.__If uncompromising honesty is the quality you seek for a film, Michelle Williams is your go-to star.__Polley wonders the same thing in nearly every scene, no matter who's in it. Is a comfortable marriage really marriage enough?__I have great admiration for [Williams] as an actress, but this story might have been better told with a less lovable star.__Margot comes across as such an elusive and unsympathetic twit that you wonder why we should care about her.__In the end, it's a story of misplaced faith. In what? Not love exactly, but in the rush of infatuation, and the illusion that this feeling can be maintained, indefinitely, without crashing.__At its worst, Polley's style veers toward the cornball. Yet, in the broad outlines of her story, she has clearly created something with a lot of hard truth.__Take This Waltz and shove it.__Somehow it is the waiting - for the fall that you expect is coming, for the marriage you figure will fall apart - that makes "Take This Waltz" one to make room for on your dance card.__A color-drenched story of lust, love, and infidelity, it suffers from a vagueness that may be the point but that feels accidental.__In "Take This Waltz," Polley doesn't fill the gap. She just makes life on either side of it both attractive and a drag.__Unfortunately for Polley, Take This Waltz is a good film serving mainly to remind us that Away From Her is a great one.__Your best option, perhaps, is to zone out from the implausible kinks in the setup... This will leave you free to savor the compositions and the melted-candy color schemes.__This romantic drama, starring the always-extraordinary Michelle Williams as a restless married woman contemplating an affair with her neighbor, is chock-full of individual moments of great power and beauty, including visual beauty.
"Headhunters" is an absurd amount of grisly fun, which is a good thing, since, looked at in any great detail, it probably doesn't hold up all that well.__By film's end, we're deep into Coen brothers territory, with an extra splash of Sam Raimi-level gore.__"Headhunters" isn't a pretty film, and it doesn't always entirely make sense, but it races along like a man chased by killers.__'Headhunters" is a frighteningly well-made thriller about an amoral art thief on the run.__Like a Teutonic techno band, this thriller is both skillfully familiar and chillingly strange.__"Headhunters" is a bit like an Ikea desk assembled with your nondominant arm -- sleek and attractive, but likely to fall to pieces if you look at it too hard.__"Headhunters" will indeed hand you your head.__A cat-and-mouse game with the giddy excitement of a heist movie.__It's crisp entertainment even as plot absurdities gum up the works - you can almost hear the pages turn as you watch.__The scenes of graphic violence are drawn out to the point where they overwhelm the story.__When we get the remake in a year or two, I hope it retains the edge and compact energy of director Morten Tyldum's movie.__I knew I was being manipulated and didn't care. It was a pleasure to see how well it was being done.__Clearly, there are streaks of farce in all this, as well as serious cracks in logic, and those who like their black comedy done to a crisp will happily feast on what Tyldum dishes up.__Headhunters is slick and spritely, a mixture of corporate skullduggery and low-life slapstick that plays like The Firm meets Blood Simple.__"Headhunters" is a well-oiled, nasty machine.__That's some good acting by Hennie, but it's also good writing by co-scribes Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg. They freshen up familiar caper and thriller tropes, adapting the bestselling prose Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesbo.__This Norwegian thriller has a winning cutthroat perversity.__At a time when many mystery thrillers fall apart in the final fifteen minutes, Headhunters maintains its integrity.__The sex, nudity and violence are nonstop, but that's what makes "Headhunters" exciting entertainment.__Brown's panic is capably rendered, but his ordeals are not worth enduring to the bitter end.
Now a new film of the play appears, adapted and directed by Terence Davies with Rachel Weisz in that stellar [Hester Collyer] role and with Rattigan's work in a freshening treatment.__The movie is an exquisite period piece, slow and dank, and unduly persuaded that it's rendering a classic.__[Weisz'] performance that transforms her from actress to movie star.__The best parts of the movie, like the scene with William's mother, involve isolated set pieces in which Weisz interacts with another actor.__A story of passion and its aftermath; of what happens when an unhappy woman goes chasing after something shiny, only to find how quickly it fades.__Davies doesn't provide stylish counterweights to the heavy drama. Any story that starts with a woman writing a suicide note is cheating us of an honest investment in the outcome.__"It's difficult to judge when you're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea." So it is.__Weisz gives a heartbreaking performance; her Hester spirals into doom, hungry for the physical pleasures she has found.__Hiddleston is good as the fickle playboy but Weisz, who smoulders as Hester, is better.__This is Rachel Weisz's movie. She's as luminous as a Pre-Raphaelite portrait, yet she brings to Hester a high-wire, modern tremulousness...__This is an extremely deft job of adaptation.__It's a time machine of a movie; but who will want to take the trip?__Maddeningly oblique and incomplete, despite paying what at times feels like excruciating attention to the minutiae of a dying love affair's final hours.__Rachel Weisz - in what has to be the performance of her career, and there have been lots of good ones - plays an intelligent woman in the grip of a lust that's too big to handle or suppress. She can either ride the tiger or be devoured.__It feels current. That's to do with the timelessness of Davies's idea of how lush a film can feel. It's also to do with the modernity of his star.__The film feels pity for the exhausted city of London. The vast metropolis was the scene of greatness during World War II, but a few years later, it is drab, hungry and without optimism.__In scene after scene, painful pauses in conversation seem to amplify the incessant ticking of the clock in the room, a subtle reminder that time rolls onward and our brief lives are not to be frittered away.__Director Terence Davies can paint melancholy and misery in as many shades as the Eskimos allegedly have words that mean "snow."__Even as it settles a bit more comfortably into its story of romantic disillusionment, The Deep Blue Sea is marked by a kind of profound stasis of choice.__Captures a very delicate sense of romantic decay.
We suspect that in her imperious voice, Vreeland would say she was mad about it, and she'd mean it as a measure of praise.__Her life, and her work, transcended what we think of as "fashion." Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel celebrates a unique and uniquely determined woman.__Many people remember some of Diana Vreeland's famous pronouncements ("I adore pink! It is the navy blue of India!") but few remember actually hearing her speak. The documentary Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel takes care of that.__For fashionphiles and pop culture vultures, there's much to devour.__Diana Vreeland is both history lesson and sentimental love letter to a fashion titan.__Legendary fashion editor Diana Vreeland was the consummate dreamer, a romantic who never looked back and propelled society forward.__"Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel" is an intriguing portrait of a true original; you only wish the movie had half the color and verve of its subject.__A feast for fashion-history buffs and anyone who applauds unstoppable eccentricity.__The late, legendary fashion editor comes alive in "Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel," an awkwardly titled but engaging documentary.__A highly entertaining and colorful portrait of a unique woman.__The visual emphasis in The Eye Has to Travel is on the pages of the magazines Vreeland dominated, and as such it's a sleek eyeful.__Vivid, delicious trip through the heyday of fashion mags is a must for followers of clothes, print design, and high society.__Vreeland comes across in the movie as something of a cross between Auntie Mame and Godzilla. She was a true original in a world where knock-offs abounded.__The film, written and directed by Vreeland's granddaughter-in-law, mainly rests on the strength of its subject.__Makes a compelling case for the late Diana Vreeland as the 20th century's pre-eminent tastemaker, not to mention one of its most extravagant personalities.__The movie has a lot going for it.__[The film] squeezes an impressive amount of information into a relatively brief running time, yet it's blandly straightforward in its use of talking heads and archival footage.__All the right photos and news clips are assembled, showing off the lady's keenly curated sense of dramatic self-presentation.__The movie is saved from feeling like a promotional puff piece by the legitimate fabulousness of Vreeland herself ...__Shows what the world saw in Vreeland: a fairy godmother determined to dress up a world of Cinderellas.
Undeniably effective as drama, as we ponder the varying degrees of ambition and talent driving these young people to push their bodies beyond the limit in the hope of grasping a future in the spotlight.__It does a great job developing its characters through its visuals - these are superphysical kids - and honing in on family dynamics.__If you have a yearning to feel awkward, inadequate and lazy, watching the whirling teenage (and preteen) talents in director Bess Kargman's First Position will do the trick.__When it's over, you won't remember so much about who won and who lost. Instead, what remains is the expression on a young dancer's face, reflected in a mirror: showing the joy of being in love with what you do.__For someone (like me) who has never been to a ballet, the talent of these teens and tweens is a revelation.__A number of the performances are plain stunning - Aran and Joan, in particular, seem born to move - and in many ways watching the movie is like watching a sporting event; there are winners and losers and favorites to cheer on.__It's an intense journey, and Kargman captures it all, down to the dancers' bloodied and bruised feet.__Yes, it is possible to create a gripping documentary about the ballet world without resorting to "Black Swan" melodramatics.__Child ballet dancer and former journalist Bess Kargman brings a dancer's passion and insight to her directorial debut, illuminating the addictive magic and fierce demands of a ballet dancer's life.__Because its subjects are so driven and so talented, "First Position," which is about ballet, is more gripping than the norm.__It's in the quick audience-reaction shots of the young dancers' exultant parents and cringing private instructors that the movie finds its most nakedly human moments.__The film shows the grueling work it takes for young dancers like Zamora to look effortless on stage, and First Position shows teachers who range from supportive to borderline abusive.__This is yet another competition doc in the unending legacy of Spellbound, but Kargman is light on her feet, and she has chosen to follow a fascinating group of kids preparing for the 2010 Youth America Grand Prix.__Beneath the jetes and bleeding feet, First Position is about toughness of mind as much as visions of beauty. In one case it's about a transformation so profound as to be unfathomable.__First Position overcomes its predictable elements thanks to the inherent visual drama of watching children strain their bodies to the limit in obsessive pursuit of their goals.__First Position is an unabashedly inspirational portrait of what even very young people can accomplish with discipline and dedication.__I've become weary of documentaries about winning prizes, but this one is special because the kids are. They are ardent and amazingly accomplished, but they are also... kids.__[It] seems fresh in the way it respects both the art in ballet and the discipline it demands - even in childhood.__An appealing, largely upbeat documentary about young ballet dancers duking it out, sometimes on point and in tulle, for top honors at the Youth America Grand Prix.__It's a great introduction to the intriguing mix of parents - neurotic, loving, pressuring, calming - who raise great kids who do great things.
It persuades us early on that its aura of political tension and suspicion, its taciturnity, its very strictness of silent observation as it begins, are fostering an intelligent thriller.__Though the film runs a mere 105 minutes, it weighs on viewers like an eternity.__The movie examines the possibility of maintaining one's humanity in a truly oppressive society.__Hoss, wearing her blond hair pulled back tight, and wearing an expression of inscrutable melancholy, gives a performance that doesn't feel like a performance at all.__The occasional ravings of the patients, ringing off the walls in Petzold's measured quiet, provide an appropriate backdrop to the heroine's need for freedom, yet the movie's politics never trump its humanity.__This is well-trod ground for Petzold, but never has it been so fully realized, so palpable, as in "Barbara."__Hoss is fantastic. Barbara is ice cold at the start, understandably so. Yet Hoss makes her sympathetic.__[Leaves] you drained and horrified.__Sometimes, the sun shines and the wind blows fresh and the very elements that make for intense hardship also open a window on intense joy.__Hoss is mesmerizing as a woman who holds it all together to the point of losing herself.__It's one terrific film, as smart, thoughtful and emotionally involving as just about anything that's out there.__It's a quiet film built of careful details.__"Barbara" re-visits the quiet, everyday tragedies of the Iron Curtain era, when paranoia ran deep and for very good reasons.__The plotting, the planning and the deepening relationships don't make for kinetic action, but they are the foundation for a smart, engrossing film.__Lit from within, like a lantern; Petzold has made a nighttime movie that ends right on the edge of dawn.__"Barbara" is a film about the old Germany from one of the best directors working in the new: Christian Petzold.__Hoss' acting is a marvel of subtlety; her body language is precisely calibrated to reveal a great deal about the character's inner feelings by the slightest changes of posture and facial expression.__The movie's quiet power comes from its air of meticulously maintained suspicion.__A sturdy suspense story, set in Stasi-infected East Germany, rich in moral compromise, individual integrity and general desperation, it's elevated by Hoss to something sublime and unforgettable ...__Barbara is Hoss' fifth film with Petzold, and the movie rests on the depth and subtlety of their working relationship.
Like a degree in gender studies, there's no payoff.__The film would probably drag if it weren't so perfectly cast, especially with the gawky-beautiful Gerwig as its center.__For the most part, it's a film filled with simple pleasures...__Damsels in Distress ambles about amiably without much of a narrative: Plot has never been Stillman's strong suit, and in this film he seems particularly indifferent to its demands.__There's a self-consciousness to "Damsels" that takes away much of the fun.__While the comedy might be patchy, Gerwig and Stillman make for quite the two-step.__It's a slight piece of work, but agreeably peculiar and endearing.__The acting and the music are delightful, the jokes arrive on schedule, and everything sort of glows.__Whit Stillman? I'm there.__This a fun group of actors to watch, although it often seems that Stillman is unsure of what to do with them.__Presumably meant to come off as affected in a comical way, the characters too often sound arrogant and ridiculous. Sometimes that's funny. Sometimes it's not. The ratio doesn't really work out the way you would like.__Fortunately, Damsels has an abundance of the erudite zingers that Stillman excels at writing, and that make his elegantly staged works seem like period pieces, even though they're set in modern times.__The premise -- young rich people discover themselves -- recalls that of Stillman's older features, but his characteristic naturalism is replaced here by overlit scenes, a saccharine symphonic score, and a halting narrative momentum.__A movie sure to reward the filmmaker's most die-hard fans, while doing little to quiet critics who found his work self-conscious to the point of insufferability.__Flat scenes, weak characters and a disjointed and almost nonexistent narrative.__[It] concerns a young woman either adopted by a fabulously odd trio of new pals or indoctrinated into the most twee cult in collegiate history. It's all in your receptivity to Stillman's brittle humor.__It's delightful and a little bewildering to find a 2012 comedy that evokes a world that exists only in the novels of P.G. Wodehouse.__It's a cri de coeur that hardly rises above a sociable interjection, an exhortation to collective revelry that leaves a sense of uneasily imposed, even quasi-martial, paces.__Too ethereal to be a satire and too arch to be a psychologically recognizable character portrait, Damsels in Distress flits prettily by without ever finding anything to be about.__Even were it not so delightful, Damsels in Distress, set at a fictional upper-crust college, would deserve a watch for its dialogue alone.
A faith-based drama about redemption and renewal that is blessed with the saving graces of persuasive performances, handsome production values and some undeniably affecting moments of spiritual uplift.__This inspirational drama, while trafficking in cliches, manages not to deliver its message too heavily.__Contrived and simplistic.__Unconditional is a little movie with a big heart, a message film that doesn't taste like medicine.__If only McCorkle had a bit more, er, faith in his audience.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Where's it all go? Nowhere, really, just down a dirty, disappointing hole. Harrelson deserved better.____It's a remarkably compelling film.__Brown is a sick man, but Harrelson makes him so interesting, so charismatic, so ... watchable, that you can't look away, even if his actions make you want to (and they will).__"Rampart" doesn't tell a coherent story as much as swirl the drain with Dave, as his increasingly desperate efforts to save himself simply result in a cascade of self-inflicted wounds.__This isn't your average out-of-control character, and Harrelson has to work against a narrowly defined screenplay that is short on specifics.__Sure to provoke furious reactions in those unwilling to succumb to its mood of reckless abandon. But for those who can, this feverish slice of LA noir is set to be one of the purest cinematic pleasures of 2012.__Director Oren Moverman understands that Woody Harrelson is a real actor and makes movies to prove it.__Something to see and little to remember, an acrid character study undone by narrative implausibilities and its own lack of purpose.__"Rampart" patrols some familiar streets, but this jarringly intimate study of a dirty Los Angeles cop sliding, crazily, down the drain has a distinctive new-cliche smell, pungent and alive.__Harrelson is an ideal actor for the role. Especially in tensely wound-up movies like this, he implies that he's looking at everything and then watching himself looking.__He insists on "keeping the family together" with the same irrational devotion he applies to his job.__Hallucinatory, elliptical, with dialogue as rich as chocolate cake, this is the self-proclaimed Demon Dog of American crime fiction at his fevered best.__It's a testament to the direction of Oren Moverman and the script he co-wrote with James Ellroy that we care what happens to such a despicable character.__With Mr. Harrelson, Mr. Moverman has created an antihero of epic proportions and indiscretions.__This movie's too small and too dark to have gotten Harrelson into the overcrowded best-actor race, but it's without question one of the year's great performances.__The movie zooms from incident to incident, piling up examples of the anti-hero's misdeeds, primarily so it can ponder how one man could be so stubbornly wicked.__Instead of leading toward understanding, "Rampart" remains a dirty cop caricature, more a complaint than a story.__The movie's got some strong moments, and Harrelson's work here is so committed that many might feel his character's journey is worth sitting through for that alone.__Bad Lieutenant made by a tediously finger-wagging Jew instead of a tediously desecrating Catholic.
In the annals of forged identity flicks, this is a towering Everest, dwarfing the deceivers in the likes of Catch Me If You Can and F for Fake.__This is edge-of-your-seat stuff and the difficulty is in the telling of the tale. To give any of this film away is a crime. You simply have to see it for yourself.__The most fascinating aspect of the movie is why the missing boy's family believed the imposter's story.__You may begin to wonder if you aren't being conned by the movie yourself.__"The Imposter" is one of the best films of the year.__You couldn't make this stuff up - and no one would buy it as fiction. But as a documentary, it's a different matter.__Beverly Dollarhide, Nicholas's mother, says of the period after her son's disappearance, "My main goal in life at that time was not to think." Apparently, the filmmakers have taken a cue from her.__Layton's dazzling film is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience superior to any Hollywood mystery you're likely to see for a long time.__"The Imposter" becomes more than just a missing-persons drama. It hints at something much darker: a real-life horror story, the full truth of which may never be known.__This is one creepy mystery.__"The Imposter" initially seems to be a tutorial in identity theft, as well as a cautionary tale about the susceptibility of people who have lost a loved one. But that's not the half of it.__It's ... practically unbelievable, but you won't be able to look away.__Layton's film joins the top ranks of nonfiction films because he recognizes that in this case no solution could be as engrossing as the questions.__This is as much a film about self-deception as it is about deception, and as such, it is a study in pain.__This is a train wreck you think you see coming, but no matter how prepared you are the nature and extent of the damage will overwhelm you.__As fiction, it would never fly. But "The Imposter" happens to be true, and it's a jaw-dropper.__The movie is fascinating, but it leaves you uneasy, because you don't always know who you're watching (actor? family member?), and you begin to feel that you're being scammed, too.__Rarely has the con game, and the human capacity to believe in improbable outcomes, been taken to such extremes as we see in "The Imposter"...__Director Bart Layton takes a story that was already fascinatingly weird to begin with and makes it even more compelling by structuring it as a shadowy film noir.__This true story plays like a gripping psychological thriller, offering hard speculation and harder truths. You won't be able to get it out of your head.
Between the gypsy psychic and the distracting characters, "Darling Companion" loses its way.__[It] has a fine cast, but doesn't seem to have much to say other than lamenting the unfairness of getting old.__It's far from a great movie - an overwritten, underplotted vanity project that's a distant echo of what director Lawrence Kasdan could do in his prime. But it has Diane Keaton, and that's enough.__It's fun to watch Keaton and Kline together, bickering and (of course) bonding all over again.__If good intentions were everything, this benevolent film would be Best in Show. Alas, it's flawed by a drowsy pace (there is far too much hiking) and superfluous, ill-conceived characters.__The movie takes a simple if shattering occurrence and uses it as a way to bring a family together, an old trick but one well played by director Lawrence Kasdan and his wife and screenwriting partner Meg.__The dog had the right idea.__You wonder why this fine cast - which has nine Oscar nominations (with four wins) among them - would bother with something so featherweight...__Initially this struck me as something you'd take your grandmother to see, but by the end it seemed more like something your grandmother would take her grandmother to see.__The film sputters and stalls and winds up behaving like the worst sort of oldster - passing gas and pretending to be deep.__It is depressing to reflect on the wealth of talent that conspired to make this inert and listless movie.__Lawrence Kasdan's fitfully amusing comedy-drama starring Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline.__Even as someone who enjoys the company of a dog, it didn't take long for me to wish the whole bunch of them would shut up, give up and go home. Get a bird or something.__It's the story that strains credulity, a navel gazer about whether a search for a lost dog can bring an uninvolved family back together as they face life in their 60s.__A film no one will remember, not even the people who star in it.__"Darling Companion'' doesn't amount to much more than a fairly painless way for the AARP set to spend an hour and a half watching a movie with stars their own age.__It feels like a film that got stuck at the pitch stage, and never quite got turned into a real screenplay.__Darling Companion is a "Pretty White People with Problems" movie, but like the dog at its center, it cozies its way into your lap and stares at you adoringly until you resist its flaws and find yourself won over.__Joseph's cynicism and wit are communicated with the spot-on casting of Kline, and Keaton ably conveys Beth's suppressed loneliness as well as her big heart.__How much more fulfilling it would have been to spend those hundred-odd minutes chasing a squirrel, taking a nap or disemboweling a stuffed animal on the living room rug.
Big, dumb and pretty good fun once the flat first hour is over, Bollywood masala Rowdy Rathore makes the grade on the strength of Akshay Kumar's charismatic dual perfs as a supercop killed on duty and a lookalike thief who takes his place.__Forgettable fun.__Ridiculous and undeniable, it's a punchy cartoon, rightly confident of its power to entertain. Why resist?__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The rapid dialogue is dry and mannered, like a David Mamet play, there's virtually no story and Cronenberg's visual scheme is cold and claustrophobic.__It feels like each and every moment bursts forth with urgent dialogue, and yet what does anyone actually say?__There's not really a movie there, nothing that sustains itself from scene to scene and nothing that's worth watching from beginning to end.__The film is all too faithful to its un-cinematic source.__"Cosmopolis," because of its allegiance to the book's mannered, offbeat language, feels like it never wakes up.__Poor Pattinson does the best he can. He's not terrible. But he's definitely out of his element, if not beyond his depth, an altar boy in a bishop's robes.__The story seems to cleave into cerebral disquisition and primal sex.__The movie isn't for everyone. But if it grabs you, prepare for it to stick in your head for days.__A flawlessly directed film about enigmatic people who speak in morose epigrams about vague universal principles they show no sign of understanding.__Despite the constrictions, Cronenberg keeps the space handsome and active. For long stretches, Cosmopolis is dreamy and funny, in an off-centered way.__It is one of the director's better movies of recent years, even if it is occasionally maddening.__David Cronenberg meets Don DeLillo at last, and it's as if all the angels of heaven have come together. And said nothing.__I took a strange pleasure in submitting to this movie's stilted but weirdly poetic rhythms. But I freely acknowledge that for others, enduring Cosmopolis may be less fun than a backseat prostate exam.__I never imagined describing a film as a cross between The Bonfire of the Vanities and Last Year at Marienbad...__It's all vapid snark, didactic sermonizing and bewildering shock tactics.__DeLillo's brilliant analysis of the destructive power of wealth that took such seductive hold on page has a tough time gaining traction on screen.__It's like a dream that engages and drifts, until waking with a start in a finale that's as bracing and raw as the rest of the film is coolly distant.__Frustratingly bland work from lead Robert Pattinson results in an awfully watery stew.__Conventional it is not. Engrossing it is.__Mr. Cronenberg's direction throughout "Cosmopolis" is impeccable, both inside the limo and out.

"The Paperboy" is one of those rare examples where you might wish the movie was less faithful to the book.__Yes, it's a dizzying stew set to boil.__The Paperboy is southern Gothic wallowing in the swamp of low camp. And if the wallowing were deliberate, this might have been hugely funny.__The Paperboy bears some promise as a good-bad movie, but it unfolds as a bad-bad one.__It's a movie that seems to have a mild form of heatstroke: it's blurry, as if filmed long ago, and feverish, and the story wanders all over the place as if lost in a bayou. When it's over, you want to wipe your brow.__The Paperboy is over-the-top every which way you look.__This one has it all: sex, violence, torture, incest, jellyfish attacks, telekinetic masturbation, Nicole Kidman peeing on Zac Efron and a gator gutted in revolting close-up.__This is just the sort of movie certain people are hoping to see when they go to the movies but would never say they go to the movies for.__"The Paperboy" suggests something Tennessee Williams might have come up with, if he didn't know how to string together a plot.__It's a good story about people who are not what they seem, about identity wavering in the heat-a true swamp tale-but the movie is messily ineffective.__Simple ugly trash.__The entire cast of "The Paperboy" glistens with a golden sheen, as if they've been sprayed with Pam cooking oil.__'The Paperboy" can't decide whether to be an unfunny sex comedy, a half-hearted detective story or a woeful race drama - so it decides to be all three ...__The movie is definitely a mess.__There is so much grit in Kidman and McConaughey's performances, it's a lot for Efron to stand up to, but he does a good job of giving Jack a cocky innocence that is disarming.__Daniels' deft adaptation of Pete Dexter's 1996 novel is even more disturbing on screen than on the page. It's a Southern Gothic noir thriller with a terrific ensemble cast.__Some of The Paperboy's missteps would be forgivable if Daniels delivered them with any conviction, but he doesn't seem capable of it.__Ludicrously obsessed with sex to often laughable extremes, it's the rare film that can be described as "horny."__This hot mess got booed by the snobs at Cannes, but there's no denying its profane energy.__There is so much sweaty, gum-smackin', Southern-accented *acting* going on, you'd applaud if you weren't appalled.
"The Thieves" carves its own niche with moments of romance and stylish mayhem mixed with a more emotionally conflicted, winner-take-all sensibility than its American brethren.__[A] sprawling, relentlessly entertaining thriller.__Welcome to the K-cinema equivalent of comfort food.__Easier to like than it is to follow, Choi Dong-hoon's glossy caper boasts all the pomp and cajolery of the true international blockbuster.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
It is never dull.__By the time this film's over, you're shaken, intrigued and reminded that art doesn't need to add up to be entrancing.__Holy Motors is some kind of wonderful.__Audiences who care about character and plot are liable to take the exit to a movie that makes sense.__All this random action, Carax suggests, is for some vast, abstract audience anxious to lose itself in imagined narratives.__This is the kind of it-can-mean-whatever-you-want-it-to-mean art film that I usually run from, but Carax is such a prodigiously gifted mesmerist that, if you give way, you're likely to be enfolded in the film's phantasmagoria.__Holy Motors is wild and unfettered and playful - the work of an artist who carries his love of cinema in his bones, and knows how to share that affection with the audience.__This is the most exhilarating cinema ride of 2012, a marvellously mobile mystery trip.__In "Holy Motors" Carax insists on our other selves. His daylong ride is a wary celebration, a joyful dirge that's served up in concentrated form by a roving band of accordion players. It's all in a day's work.__As cryptic and unpredictable as that premise might suggest.__Lavant is splendid in the film, and he's essentially the entire film - and yet, "Holy Motors" is somewhat more than a contraption built for a fearless performer.__Here is a film that is exasperating, frustrating, anarchic and in a constant state of renewal. It's not tame.__I don't know what Lavant is playing here because I've never seen anything like it.__Leos Carax's surreal ode to ... identity? Movies? Performance? Identity and performance in movies, or movies and performance in identity, or some other combination that will come to mind upon further viewings?__[A] crazy-beautiful reverie about movies, love, the love of movies, and the inevitability of human melancholy by the perpetually mysterious French filmmaker Leos Carax.__Carax produces the startling dislocations of reality that Bunuel pulled off, but without the gleeful wit.__If nothing else, you'll come out of it feeling perceptually refreshed, as if you'd just had a ride on an aesthetic and philosophical log flume.__It's an exhilarating trip of movie madness and sadness.__The sort of enigmatic movie that many critics embrace because it's open to endless interpretation ...__It's the coolest and strangest movie of the year, and once it gets its druglike hooks in your brain, you'll never get them out again.
____The laughs come fast and breezy, just as Delpy intends.__While it's nowhere near a perfect film, 2 Days in New York is worth seeing, not only for the comedy but also for the realism of the smaller moments.__[Delpy] and Rock, in the midst of free-flying French chaos, find a sweet chemistry together ...__Much of the alleged humor is based on French-English language gags, or cultural differences or continental mores vs. the priggishness of Americans, but it's all more irritating than funny.__"2 Days in Paris" is as self-assured as it is slight, a deliberate diversion whose winsome charms never run dry.__A manic and funny, if ultimately frustrating, sequel.__It's extremely funny, one of the funniest films of 2012, with a particularly winning style - far-fetched, extreme and nonstop.__Chatty, neurotic, maddeningly messy, often very funny, "New York" spins in a lunatic orbit of its own.__Finds its comedy in the familiar annoyances of urban life (a contentious neighbor, random acts of vandalism), in the conflict between parents and siblings, but also in bigger, kookier, existential quandaries.__The comedy works some of the time; the pathos, more so.__Julie Delpy has particularly impressed me over the years.__It's time for Delpy to leave Marion in New York for good and head back to Paris. Besides, the sausage is better there.__Delpy's good at keeping Marion's complaints sharp and funny, rather than wan and whiny. Even so, the movie's a bumpy ride as her good farcical instincts vie with the yen for cheap laughs.__About six hours of those "2 Days in New York" don't work at all. And, coming as they do at the end, they tend to deflate the charm of the trip.__2 Days in New York plays like 2 years in Attica.__The film, which is about a chaotic 48 hours in Marion's life, succumbs to the chaos it depicts, and so undermines its best intentions. It is, all in all, a likable mess.__The screenplay - which was written by Delpy, Landeau and Nahon - has a jittery kind of honesty about it, which Rock and Delpy sometimes push to its limits.__Julie Delpy is boundlessly appealing. And Chris Rock is acerbic fun. But the frenzied cross-cultural gags take the piss out of the real subject: how blood ties can turn love into a battlefield.
The movie is a psalm to those who, far from pursuing the path of the Rolling Stones, stayed trapped under a rock.__This film could have been -- should have been, even -- something special. But it's not.__The period details are spot-on and the soundtrack is great.__Yes, it's about rock and New Jersey, but it's also about getting a life going and dreaming, and that's timeless, classic stuff.__Well-observed but occasionally disjointed, it's a film that's more about thematic tone, sound and images than it is driven by plot.__There are plenty of laughs along with the melodrama as the band and its members struggle through young adulthood.__A movie that feels at once deeply personal and more than a little confused.__Rock & roll is here to stay. And David Chase gets some well-deserved satisfaction.__Mostly, Not Fade Away is a hit.__Ultimately a disappointment - this is a movie easy to watch and even easier to forget.__The performances and music are a pleasure, and Chase's affection for the period is palpable.__Aiming for a generational statement that encompasses the entire '60s experience, [Chase] turns unexpectedly inept.__Somewhat autobiographical and worth seeing despite its somewhat muffled quality ...__Chase takes a basement view of the birth of America's '60s rock revolution with his big-screen debut Not Fade Away.__Chase has captured this one for all time. He delivers on the movie's title.__It's a "personal" movie that, in some ways, seems impersonal. Everything seems a bit too varnished and staged and overly familiar.__What makes this movie unique is that it's not just one more story of a band that got big in a hurry.__The acting is OK, but none of the leads has the kind of sizzle that might have turned this into something as special as another film set roughly in the same era, "Diner.''__By focusing on musicians who are talented but finally not good or persistent enough to succeed in the big time, "Not Fade Away" offers a poignant, alternative, antiheroic history of the big beat.__Alas, Not Fade Away is far less pungent than the period it attempts to evoke.
____Just earnest enough to blend its religious theme with a beer-chugging hero for a surprisingly contemporary look at faith.__The film's heart is in the right place; it just can't make the rest of its parts function smoothly.__An uncommon thoughtfulness about spiritual issues distinguishes this otherwise generic coming-of-age story.__"Blue Like Jazz" is a pleasant film, as well-intentioned as the character Don himself, but it ducks the thorniest questions of faith and dogma while patting itself on the back for realism.__It is - somewhat surprisingly, given the heavy-handed subject - neither sanctimonious nor preachy.__It tackles existential struggles that many of us grapple with - and the film industry virtually ignores - while doing so in an entertaining way.__An overlong mishmash of coming-of-age comedy, social satire and spiritual think-piece whose ultimate stance on religion feels awfully fuzzy.__Don's crisis of faith, which should be the movie's core and engine, is never really convincing. It's spelled out but dramatically inert, lost among the yuks of the Reed kookiness.__This is a movie with heart but too many distractions.__The outcome rarely seems out of God's hands, and the filmmaking is low-budget-earnest to the point of drabness - it's not a movie to make converts.__It's a glorious anomaly: a subtle, sophisticated, open-minded, and courageously non-judgmental Christian film even non-believers can enjoy. Hallelujah!__May be more nuanced than the usual Left Behind fire-and-brimstone sermonizing you find in much contemporary pro-Christian cinema, but it still leaves behind a sulfuric stink.__One only has so much patience ... for watching Communion-wafer-thin characters caught in a liberal-arts cartoon.__None__None__None__None__None
'Undefeated' is no 'Hoop Dreams', but it's sturdily built and worthwhile.__"Undefeated" doesn't have a deep penetration of poverty and race in its playbook, but it does have enough heart to make substantial forward progress.__It's a surprisingly moving, emotional film, even for those who (like me) know little of football; by its end, you just might be blinking away a few tears.__Volunteer high school coach Bill Courtney says, "Football doesn't build character. Football reveals character." The triumphant sports documentary "Undefeated" proves that it does both.__[A] winning documentary.__[A] stirring, emotional portrait of a high school football team in the impoverished neighborhood of North Memphis, Tenn.__It's a bit too long and a bit too vague at times, but this is a film about dedication, progress and the bond of human effort. It just also happens to include football.__"Undefeated'' needs less of what we know we've seen (the football stuff) and more of the players' and coaches' lives, which even if we feel we've seen, we haven't.__What makes this a terrific film is how much we care about the players.__Courtney really does believe all that stuff about adversity and character, and the film is moving for its modest tale of boys learning to act like men.__This film is distinctly minor league. But it does provide the thumbs-up emotional lift of a bumper-sticker message on game day.__It's a credit to directors Daniel Lindsay and T.J. Daniels that the personal stories of the kids and coaches resonate more than the wins and losses.__Undefeated is undeniably inspirational stuff.__For the most part admirably chooses honest documentation over emotional manipulation.__"Undefeated" is an emotional and effective film, and I'm happy for it.__I wanted it blow my mind, to flatten me. Demanding, I know.__I wish the directors had emphasized more of the players' personal lives apart from the football field. But, in the end, this is a documentary about Courtney and the transformative powers of caring. He works wonders on his players and they reciprocate.__There are interesting edges and unexpected sides to "Undefeated" beginning with that title - because, not long after we've settled in, we watch the team lose its very first game.__If the film had something to say about football as football instead of football as life, I'd be interested. It doesn't.__While "Undefeated" travels well-tilled inspirational ground, it's also an irresistible story of football, faith and the lust for happily-ever-after black-and-white endings.
Always the star of his movies, even when he shouldn't be, the atheist Moretti gets caught up in his own papal bull. But Piccoli's blessed empathy prevails.__This is rich material that Moretti mines for both superficial absurdity and deep pathos. But he refuses to forge an orthodox happy ending, let alone a tinny satire.____We Have a Pope takes its shots at the institution of the Catholic Church, but this is by no means a scathing satire. It's more of a character study, insightful and nuanced, about a man grappling with a profound sense of inadequacy, questioning himself.__Though skeptical, the film isn't at all mean-spirited.__"We Have a Pope" is a nuanced, moving and profoundly humane exploration of doubt, faith, weakness and resolve.__"We Have a Pope" has great heart.__On the surface, this Italian dramedy about a troubled cardinal reluctant to accept his election to the papacy is a likable, understated farce. Look closer and you'll see that it has serious issues on its mind.__Moretti's latest work looks at the church sympathetically, veristically, comically.__There's a sweetness to Italian director Nanni Moretti's "We Have a Pope" that belies its seemingly unholy premise...__Piccoli gives the film a depth it perhaps doesn't deserve.__Whenever it stays with Piccoli ... it's mysterious and moving, struck by the humility of a man who's not up to playing God.__Despite moments that strain awfully hard to remind us that the church and its new leader are in crisis, it's basically habemus comoedia. We have a comedy.__Melville (an excellent Michel Piccoli), not being the front-runner, is caught so completely unawares that he goes into meltdown mode while the world waits.__The film is perhaps 15 minutes too long, and there are a few too-convenient scenes, but overall "We Have a Pope'' should prove a crowd-pleaser.__Mr. Moretti finds broad comedy in the antics of some clerics, who can seem as sweet as children, but in Melville there is pathos and there is tragedy, and not his alone.__A gentle fable whose humanist heart beats in Michel Piccoli's nuanced performance.__It's a half-sweet, half-rueful existential drama in which the satire comes secondary.__What appears to be an amusing tale of a leader who has lost his way is also an unapologetic challenge to faith itself.__The movie is a near-relentless intellectual muddle, throwing out signifiers and metaphors lazily and to no particular effect.
It's been ages since De Niro tackled a character as rich and challenging as this, and he tackles it head-on.__He might be guilty of showboating, but De Niro's knockout performance is a declaration that the star of "Raging Bull" isn't ready to hang up his gloves.__Weitz digs diligently for emotional truths and makes the most of his excellent cast.__I'm happy to report that De Niro hasn't lost his chops. At least not quite.__Heads downward in every sense of the word.__For a movie that deals with suicide, homelessness and cocaine addiction, writer-director Paul Weitz's latest family drama feels strangely bland.__What's so satisfying about Weitz films like this one is how his lost boys and lost adults find themselves in the awkward dance of intimacy.__The story is gripping, compelling. One wonders what De Niro might have done with such a role 30, 35 years ago.__A little more nuance would benefit the film, which eventually starts to feel belabored, even bleak.__A handful of acting moments aside, "Being Flynn" is a drama without much in the way of rewards.__"Being Flynn'' is earnest to a fault, and it offers the now-rare sight of De Niro giving an actual performance.__To summon up his most iconic role must represent De Niro's faith in this film.__With a chilly color palette and a suitably melancholy score, Being Flynn does a decent job of finding its own poetry in the way that its characters write, and rewrite, and revise their own lives.__It's easy to imagine Being Flynn's story turning precious in the wrong hands, but Weitz and his cast spin it just right - as a narrative that is both emotionally real, and just writerly enough to suit its leading men.__Writer-director Paul Weitz can't make the solipsistic central protagonists interesting, even though his best films (About a Boy, In Good Company) deal with surrogate father-son relationships.__Yes, it has a fine performance by De Niro. Yes, it briefly brings us into the middle of a homeless hell.__The real coup de grace for this would-be serious-minded drama is the sledgehammer-subtle direction of Paul Weitz...__Weitz...began adapting Flynn's book for the screen eight years ago. It's too bad that he didn't figure out in the ensuing years that it was not worth his efforts.__There is honest feeling, genuine humanity and real intelligence in this movie, but there is also a sense of caution, of indecisiveness, that undermines its potential power.__The movie's emotional content was manifest as an absence. What stayed with me most memorably was the father's insufferable bombast and the son's sad passivity.
A fascinating portrait of a modern artist and activist trying to make a difference within China's repressive political system.__The film's recurring theme is of an artist on a perpetual hunt for transparency, in his country and abroad.__A movie that somehow mixes apprehension for Ai with a feeling of warmth and, certainly, fun.__Affable and unpretentious, Ai comes across as a cagey operator whose candor is very appealing.__It's likely to change the way you think about art and politics and the state of China today.__Using archival footage dating back to Ai's adventures in the New York art world in his 20s, Klayman traces his evolution as a creator and as an activist.__In terms of getting his message out to a wider audience, this film simply and effectively serves as part of the cause.__Though he has paid the price, Ai is a pathfinder in this new phenomenon in tactical insurrection. Never Sorry is a new-style profile in 21st-century courage.__Ai admits that he's become "a brand for liberal thinking and individualism," though that's nothing to be ashamed of -- at this point, his Warholian talent for self-promotion may be the only thing keeping him alive.__The story is enthralling, but it's not over, and there's no telling where it's going. Which makes what we see on screen all the more involving.__A sobering, cautionary tale.__One of the most engagingly powerful movies of the year almost completely on the strength of Ai's rumpled charisma and the confusion it creates in the bureaucratic mindset of the Chinese Communist Party.__As this sometimes haphazard documentary shows, Ai won't stop talking. Or blogging. Or tweeting.__A useful primer, though it also focuses a bit more on the activism than on the art.__He may still seem enigmatic, but we don't need to know his deepest thoughts. The intensity of his daily life and the persecution he continues to face is more than enough to understand who he is and what he is enduring.__Klayman had full access to Ai, 55, following him around for two years. The sweetest footage involves Ai and his mother.__Ai Weiwei is a crucial figure of East-West cultural communication and contemporary history, whose middle finger extended at the centers of power stands for a rising tide of global discontent.__The fluidity and convenience of digital moviemaking tools explain some of its freshness, as does Ms. Klayman's history as a budding documentarian.__The film's greatest distinction is its intimacy.__One can't help wishing the subject would make his own, more complex cinematic self-portrait. But for now, Klayman has provided a valuable introduction to a man everyone should know.
____This spirited troupe of women ... makes us citizens of the village, invested in their joys and fears. We grieve with them, under that burning sun, and hope with them for a lasting peace.__"Where Do We Go Now?" is more interesting than satisfying.__With elements of a musical, a melodrama and a multicultural romance, "Where Do We Go Now?" is as hard to define as the crossroads region where it's set.__This is energetic, bursting with sincerity, yet also frustrating and disappointing.__It is, at times, a charming reprieve from the usually dour cinematic explorations of Middle Eastern conflicts.__Labaki never claimed to be Noel Coward, but the facile comedy leads to a dilution of the message she strives so strenuously to make.__Time passes with a sense that nothing is really happening, until suddenly too much happens all at once.__Where Do We Go Now? is a tragic-comic fable that speaks to how we live now, and have lived for far too long.__Labaki is a forceful director and a stunning screen presence, but "Where Do We Go Now?" suffers from diffuseness.__It's a fresh take on Mideast strife to see the endless battles from a feisty feminist point of view, but most of the acting and plotting is subpar.__The meandering script occasionally has an unpolished feel, confusingly taking too long to flesh out parts of the story while making unsettling swings from comedy to tragedy and back.__A satire in which pathos competes with light comedy and neither quite flourishes.__The movie is never quite bold enough to point out the contradiction of Muslims and Christians hating one another, even though they both in theory worship the same god.__Veering from wackiness to horror and then back again is the kind of balancing act that would challenge even the most talented filmmakers, and Labaki, for all her good intentions and daring ideas, just can't swing the shift.__Making a movie about sectarian violence in which the local religious figures are comically powerless, at worst, seems like too easy a path to take. Nothing springs from nothing.__The lack of flow and coherence in "Where Do We Go Now?'' leaves not only the characters, but also the audience, wondering where to go.__In the end, "Where Do We Go Now?" has little to say about human conflict beyond the obvious.__The continually shifting tone of the movie, whose director also did the romantic comedy "Caramel," keeps you giddily off balance.
Arnon's filmmaking is flaccid, with TV-style interviews and rote reaction shots in place of cinematic imagery and deftly edited surprises.__There's something touching about the way Goldfinger obeys his moral compass.__I will salute the deftness and intelligence with which Goldfinger observes the reactions of the living to the revelations of the dead.__Are things better left alone or is revealing all always the best path? "The Flat," to its credit, offers nothing like a definitive answer.__"The Flat" is a compelling tale of history made personal, and of what happens when light is shone on something previously murky.__The movie feels more like a thriller and a mystery than a documentary. Perhaps someday, someone will be inspired to dramatize this astonishing story.__Engrossing doc finds buried bonds between an Israeli family and an important Nazi.__This fascinating docu should easily attract crossover auds, and merits arthouse exposure.__A spellbinding documentary about family secrets ...__The Flat is about the persistence of denial, and of hope.__A fascinating and sensitive examination of Jewish-Nazi collaboration, generational amnesia and the delicate construction of the thing we call history.__It tells an out-of-the-ordinary personal story and examines broad historical issues of societal memory and selective amnesia, of what is hidden between generations and what is revealed.__A film that begins as a family quest but evolves into a gripping study of know-don't-tell reticence and the umbilical tie of a lost homeland.__Goes from intriguing to astonishing by way of unfathomable.__Ultimately, this is not a film about one specific event but about human nature - most notably, the instincts toward denial and delusion, acceptance and forgiveness. From start to finish, revelations abound.__In families, this fascinating film suggests, acknowledging or denying the darker truths of one's legacy is a choice that must be made again and again, each and every day.__There's only so deep Goldfinger can dig. After a while, he's left unearthing nothing but fitfully fascinating speculation.__None__None__None
The women's dialogue is pungently ribald but diffuse; too often, shouting and shrieking and gesticulating take the place of engaged performance.__A nasty little piece of work -- a phrase I use not with contempt but with grudging admiration.__Its actresses - particularly Dunst - are terrific. Headland has a nice feel for music, too, and takes some editing risks.__I don't see why women being as slobby and gross as the guys is such a feminist breakthrough -- especially since, as in Bachelorette, the slobbiness and grossness is witless.__As smart and popreferential as Headland's writing is, it's a little underwhelming when it comes to delivering on laughs.__It's a sour, only fitfully funny affair, wasting the abilities of its otherwise talented cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst, James Marsden, Adam Scott and Isla Fisher.__Even in this dreary, going nowhere role, Dunst is fascinating to watch.__Talented actors are wasted in a film that induces more cringes than chuckles as women old enough to know better act like horny sailors on leave, absorb mass quantities of alcohol and drugs, and generally behave horribly.__Headland works hard to reconcile the wild and the tame; if she never quite gets the balance right, ya gotta admire her bold juxtaposition of overdose-resuscitation gags with lessons on self-loathing and bulimia.__The lion's share of Bachelorette, written and directed by Leslye Headland, is unnervingly entertaining.__For women who find the film grim, I imagine that's because part of it feels true and rare in an American movie.__"Bachelorette" commits only one crime, but it's a make-or-break offense -- it's just not quite funny enough.__Dunst, Caplan and Fisher make a delicious trio as they stir up a bitches' brew of revenge against poor Becky (Wilson). Headland can write zingers that would make the cruelest bridezilla blush.__What's actually off-putting about this movie is how desperate the filmmakers are to exploit other people's ideas.__The best reason to see Bachelorette is Dunst, once a child star with an uncanny ability to project maturity, now an actress with an ever-increasing range.__"Bachelorette" comes at you with the crackling intensity of machine-gun fire. Maybe the safest way to watch it is by peeking out from a behind a sandbag.__Bachelorette will no doubt be divisive, possibly along generational lines. If you have to ask "Do women really talk this way?" it's not for you.__Spending time with these people is hellish.__Not to sound too much like a bratty teen-and these bachelorettes should know better-but, um, why should I care again?__Caplan ... steals all of her scenes, takes them to the Target returns desk for illicit refunds, and spends all the money on whatever unicorn sweat gives you big, dewy eyes like Mary-Louise Parker.
A dumb-dumb variant on the Death Wish vigilante justice genre.__[Cage] acquits himself well enough in this otherwise rudimentary thriller from deliriously unsubtle director Roger Donaldson.__It's a perfectly palatable and even engaging thriller, albeit one requiring several leaps of faith and/or disengagement with reality.__Donaldson ... seems to have lost all talent for pacing.__[Cage] shouldn't do any more movies in which his character signals his acceptance of a Faustian bargain by buying two candy bars.__It's refreshing to see Nicolas Cage, non-histrionic and sort of subtle, in a halfway clever piece of indie pulp about a teacher who enlists a cult of vigilantes to kill the man who raped his wife.__Seeking Justice evokes the post-Watergate paranoia of '70s thrillers like The Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor without having a worthy conspiracy at the bottom.__It's one of those productions that is neither good enough nor bad enough to be enjoyable.__There's a good idea here, in the story of helpless victims who get caught up in citizen vigilantism. But it's buried under a cheap, straight-to-DVD esthetic.__It's a crime thriller starring Nicolas Cage, but it's not as bad as that phrase implies.__There's plenty to enjoy in this old-fashioned exploitation movie.__Seeking Justice is ultimately as bland, undistinguished, and primed for a direct-to-video mass burial as its generic title.__I continue to consider Cage a gifted (if uneven) actor, but a movie like "Seeking Justice" challenges my faith.__Seeking Justice is memorable only because it contains what may be my favorite new Cage line reading of all time.__Nicolas Cage has spent so long turning himself into a living cartoon that he's lost the ability to play human beings.__Seeking Justice is an intense thriller so full of shocks it keeps you wired from start to finish.__Working with a pip of a premise, Seeking Justice is the kind of effective middle-range pulp thriller that has lately become an endangered species.__Neither the script's conspiracies nor Nicolas Cage's performance is weird enough to trump the film's generic feel...__What is it, Nic? What happened? What do they do, send you the angry-guy action movies that Liam Neeson turns down?__It's not that 'Justice' doesn't achieve its goals - but the goals are so modest that disappointment is inevitable.
As a thriller, 'Sound of My Voice' tails off and its budget shows. But for Marling it's an impressive calling card.__"Sound of My Voice" at once dramatizes and questions the power of belief.__There is a huge difference between an unexpectedly sudden ending (like The Sopranos) and a non-ending.____There's nothing wrong with asking viewers to fill in some holes. But "Sound of My Voice" leaves you dangling, reaching out for something that's just not there.__Behold the trials and tribulations of going undercover. It doesn't matter if it's cop or journalist, a muddying of purpose takes hold once a mole plunges deeper into the darkness.__The intelligence in it is both soothing and intimidating.__This plays like an early George Romero shocker but without Romero's humor or social commentary.__Sound of My Voice grounds its science fiction in scarily effective "what ifs" that don't require a light year's stretch of the imagination.__[Marling] is a talent with an understated presence. It conveys in this film an insidious conviction: What is her motive, really?__[The] idea is intriguing enough. But this clever, low-budget film kicks the concept up a few notches to mesmerizing.__That the movie is part of a possible trilogy doesn't make up for the thin, underdeveloped feel. But Marling, who weaves a strong spell, will probably keep appearing in our future.__Fascinates and titillates, but never quite persuades.__You just want something energetic to happen, and it doesn't until the film's effective final scene.__Sound of My Voice serves up moments of extreme dread and discomfort, but works a winning undercurrent of playful absurdity into the material as well.__Proves how effectively you can set the mind-bending mood without any special effects, action sequences or spectral rabbits.__There's an unshakeable sense of uneasiness as one never knows precisely what might occur, and the truth is almost impossible to discern.__A sharp little cult thriller with a do-it-yourself ending.__None of this really adds up to much beyond an hour-and-a-half or so of vague doubletalk, arbitrary decisions and increasingly annoying frustration.__"Sound of My Voice'' holds your attention for a while, but fails to build much suspense as it races toward a predictable climax.
A fascinating portrait of a 21st-century post-industrial hellscape.__Detropia's filmmakers stay out of the picture, hanging back to allow the viewer to absorb the meaning of Detroit's fate. It is even more complex than we thought.__A startling, haunting documentary about a once-great city, "Detropia" is all but a eulogy for Detroit.__Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing, Oscar-nominated for their earlier Jesus Camp, aim a compassionate and artful lens in their new documentary Detropia, finding signs of life in the ruined city.__City services are shutting down, schools are closing, houses are being demo'd by the thousands - like lights being turned out one by one, "Detropia" powerfully captures a city fighting not to go dark.__Artfully - perhaps too artfully - illustrates the transformation of the Motor City from a middle-class utopia to an urban nightmare of blight, crime and fleeing residents.__Just as the film finds an aesthetic in its dilapidated setting, the city's residents find hope in a desperate place, a place that once represented hope itself.__The movie is heavy on statistics (all of them grim), yet what lingers is an operatic sense of tragedy.__"Detropia" feels somewhere between loose (which is good) and aimless (which isn't).__Via beautiful cinematography, the film wanders the city, contrasting a new automaker's towers with abandoned hotels, derelict theaters, ruined houses and people walking through the snow down the middle of streets because there's no traffic.__Grady and Ewing are exceptionally skilled and sensitive visual storytellers, adroit at recognizing decisive moments and smart enough to let viewers make of them what they will.__"Detropia" offers up a mirror to the country: This is what the future may look like. Now, what do you want to do about it?__This documentary film, about the deconstruction of a great American city, is surprisingly lyrical and often very moving.__Moving from union hall to town hall, from brutal salary negotiations to contentious plans to create urban farms out of concrete wasteland, the film listens and moves on.__What the movie captures overall looks like a scene from a sci-fi, postapocalyptic nightmare.__At times, as Ewing and Grady's cameras prowl its empty streets, the city seems like the world's largest ghost town.__Imagine if Frederick Wiseman and David Lynch had a bastard child, and you'll get a sense of the movie's off-kilter aesthetic, a potent and pointed mix of firsthand observation and surreal flights of fancy.__Beautifully composed and purposefully edited to a haunting electronic score ...__A potent snapshot of a potential future for many American cities.__Doc about Detroit's state of abandonment offers snapshots and sounds but little new information.
"The Well-Digger's Daughter" isn't a mind-blower; it's not supposed to be. It's a light lunch with an old friend whom it's good to see again.__Auteuil's direction is a lot like his acting -- well-mannered and likable, yet staid and ultimately inconsequential.__To call "The Well Digger's Daughter" an old-fashioned film is to pay it a compliment. Here is a love story embedded in traditional values.__"The Well-Digger's Daughter" is perhaps a bit too sentimental. But the performances are so heartfelt that its occasional excesses are easily forgiven.__It's classical moviemaking of a sort rarely seen now, a love story of surprising joy with rounded, flawed but humane characters.__What resonates is a sense of humanity that sometimes gets lost in films with less regard for traditional storytelling, or respect for simple emotion.__Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Patricia and Jean-Pierre Darroussin are almost enchanting, but it is Auteuil, entering a new career as mature actor-director, whom we want to cheer.__"The Well-Digger's Daughter" feels decidedly, almost defiantly, old-fashioned, but not necessarily in a bad way.__It's the first film directed by the actor Daniel Auteuil, as part of a four-film project to remake films by the writer-director Marcel Pagnol, and if the others are this good, this is a project to look forward to.__Let "The Well-Digger's Daughter" take you back in time, not once but several times over.__Auteuil the director knows not to get in the way of Pagnol's plot machinery. Auteuil the actor is another story.__It's a movie that could easily have been made 50 years ago, and I don't mean that as a knock. There is much to be said for a film that values unflashy craft and simple, unhurried storytelling.__Even as you wish the material had been reshaped into something riskier, you may find yourself appreciating the sincerity and unshowy workmanship that went into the movie.__[It's] enjoyable enough as it plods along, and the final act wraps things up on a fulfilling note.__A pastoral wrapped in gauze, sunlight and sentimentality.__An unchallenging but utterly palatable movie to take your subtitle-reading grandma to see on a Sunday afternoon.__You feel yourself slowing down and relaxing as you watch; there's nothing rushed or crowded about this film, just a quiet story carefully told.__Auteuil is hardly the first to sing the praises of Provence, but he sings with a passion eloquent enough to give nostalgia a good name.__The Well-Digger's Daughter pushes a number of nostalgia buttons at once, most of them pleasing.__Doesn't give us reason to assume that what we don't see is much more scandalous than what we do.
There will never be another Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor, but Hollywood may have found a new Lee Remick in Mary Elizabeth Winstead.__Winstead and Paul make their characters feel like flesh and blood, not stereotypical Lost Weekenders. Their love is as real as their future is shaky. And that's the film's great tragedy.__The camera work is handheld and jittery, reflecting Kate's often wobbly state of mind, and the character's decidedly nonglam wardrobe, minimal makeup and charm-free home feel honest and right.__Winstead, a relative newcomer, handily carries this slender film.__It's an addiction-and-recovery movie without the usual side-effect of wallowing melodrama.__Winstead is an inarguably warm actor. She's just not doing the sort of work that transcends the movie's shortcomings.__Smashed belongs to Winstead.__It conveys a rare depth of understanding and compassion for its protagonist.__As disappointingly predictable as the final chapters are, nothing can diminish Winstead's outstanding performance as Kate.__Winstead is terrific as a young woman scared into sobriety, only to discover telling people the truth is much harder than lying and hiding her addiction.__"Smashed" never really rises much above the level of a dramatic public service announcement.__The act of going out there as an unknown and coming back a star is the time-honored showbiz fantasy, and if there's any justice that's about to come true for Mary Elizabeth Winstead on the basis of "Smashed."__Winstead is very good in "Smashed," though she's saddled with a merely adequate co-starring performance.__It's familiar stuff, but at least it takes addiction and recovery seriously; the depiction of Alcoholics Anonymous feels particularly heartfelt.__This is a serious movie about drinking but not a depressing one.__The movie has some powerful moments, but it's mostly superficial.__Winstead has an alert charm and curious eyes and, 30 years ago, might have been one of that decade's glorious gang of Smart Brunettes - Karen Allen, Debra Winger, Brooke Adams.__While Smashed documents both the crazy highs and the terrifying lows of addiction, the story is primarily about commitment.__There needs to be a 12-step program for movie people to stop sharing their "deeply personal" yet insight-free stories of addiction.__The movie observes unblinkingly what can happen to a couple when one member stops drinking and the other doesn't.
The intervention of Tony Soprano, who lives not far away, is urgently called for.__The Oranges does not taste freshly squeezed.__The leafy green trees evident everywhere in what purports to be New Jersey Christmas scenes aren't the only thing that feels off in the predictable domestic bedroom comedy The Oranges.__You want something that plays a little sharper, and cuts a little deeper. You want something that demands more of its performers, and delivers more to its audience.__You know the movie has an insurmountable problem when the two adulterers, who profess to be madly in love, don't even seem like they want to be in the same room.__The Oranges displays an air of efficient economy. Nothing is messy, no beat too long, the actors hit their marks.__Less of a laugh riot than it should be.__As a seven-year veteran of the New Jersey suburban experience, I can testify that it nails the milieu's specifics.__"The Oranges" hits and misses at random.__Its concerns are not the usual movie concerns, and it takes what might have been a standard plot in some unexpected directions.__"The Oranges" is a watered-down dramedy with little sense of place - or human behavior.__How could a movie starring Hugh Laurie, Oliver Platt, Allison Janney and Catherine Keener go so wrong?__Flirting with farce, the film never gets out of comic first gear.__Julian Farino ... [works] so hard to convince us of the Deep Inner Goodness of everyone involved.__It's a familiar story made fresh by actors who know how to make each breath matter.__What I liked was the movie's feel for the emotional mess and ambivalence of family ties, and its openness without hysteria to the fact that some of those ties might fray beyond repair.__When it's funny, it's laugh-out-loud funny, yet when the situation calls for groans of vicarious embarrassment, it provides them in spades.__Laurie and Meester are both likable actors, and a good thing; otherwise the audience reaction would probably be something similar to that of their families.__"The Oranges" is a pleasant little farce that never works up enough steam and that undercuts its players with thin writing and characterizations.__If you think you've seen this already, that's because you have.

When a place and its people are this stylish, we can't help but be drawn to them.__"Chico & Rita" is that rare thing, a cartoon for adults, with a bittersweet take on love and fate and a romantic's view of the night.__A pure delight, a keenly affecting, visually ravishing tale.__A buttery rich animated tale of love, jazz, showbiz, fame and politics in the late '40s and early '50s that is as catchy as its tunes.__When a soundtrack this fluidly elegant is married to trite dialogue, thin characterizations, and chockablock animation, it has to go down as a missed opportunity.__Presented in a wash of animated colors, this story of a hot-headed sexy Latina songstress and her jazz piano player takes on new life.__Remarkably sexy for its genre (it's not for kids at all), it's nostalgic about a time and place that rarely gets treated on film ("Godfather II" touched on it), and it has an emotional pull that may catch you by surprise.__It's entertaining to watch, and I enjoyed the way they slipped in such real-life figures as Dizzy Gillespie beside the fictional leads.__By virtue of its simple, stylized look - bold lines and color blocks - and effervescent Cuban jazz score, the Spanish animated feature "Chico & Rita" rises above its routine story of a troubled love affair between talented musicians.__There's an outline of an epic love story here, but the screenwriters never bother to fill it in all the way.__The film melds dazzling visuals and a wildly infectious score into a simple yet affecting love story.__The real romance here is between the filmmakers and the cultural moment they hope to document.__"Chico and Rita'' beguiles first and foremost as a bebop romance that evokes a bygone era as well as, or maybe even better than, "The Artist."__This sexy, pulpy, very grown-up film is not your usual best animated feature material.__A dazzling and delightful work of modernist animation, a classic movie romance and a hip-swinging, finger-popping tale of musical revolution...__Sexy, sweet and laced with a sadness at once specific to its place and time and accessible to anyone with a breakable heart, "Chico & Rita" is an animated valentine to Cuba and its music.__It's so passionate about the Latin and big-band music of the '40s, '50s and '60s that it'll make anyone who grew up listening to those vibrant rhythms feel like a kid again.__A heady wonder for fans of the music, the era, or visual creative art in general.__An animated film that could actually open up audiences to the world, instead of giving them an escape from it.__A dazzling thing to behold.
For the most part it's all rather pleasant, if somewhat aimless.__Lee's typically paradoxical statements on race and religion muddle the narrative, and his old stylistic tricks -- saturated color schemes, characters addressing the camera -- aren't exactly inspired.__The story is static for about 90 minutes, then rises to action, but in a way that seems impromptu, either made up on the spot or ill-considered.__When Spike Lee fails he fails big, and he goes down in flames with "Red Hook Summer."__Lee's latest film feels like several intriguing ideas in search of an over-arching story.__This coming-of-age portrait provides one more instance of Lee as one of this country's finest cinematic regionalists.__In truth, the film fizzles as much as it fumes. There is a kind of lassitude that sets in, even as it builds toward some kind of reckoning.__It's a scramble, marked by the unruly variety of visual strategies Lee prefers.__Here is Lee at his most spontaneous and sincere, but he could have used another screenplay draft, and perhaps a few more transitional scenes.__This is an illustrated lecture - a jumbled, rushed cinematic rant. The ideas are there. The story is not.__A movie that's alive and spontaneous and surprising is a rare enough thing to encounter-especially one that manages to address subjects as divisive and painful as inner-city black poverty without getting maudlin or preachy.__Welcome back, Spike. It's good to see you again.__Spike Lee now seems to be trying to be the world's oldest student filmmaker. Take out the rookie mistakes from "Red Hook Summer," and there'd be nothing left.__Peters brings a magical energy to the movie's most laggard moments, infusing a so-what drama with a must-see performance.__From a storytelling perspective, Red Hook Summer is an absolute mess.__Lee grapples with a number of urgent themes, but his approaches are often either too direct (we are repeatedly pummeled by the bishop's fiery preaching) or too circuitous (the verbal and visual meanderings are sometimes valuable, and sometimes not).__A clear failure, yet Lee is getting at things that mystify him.__Spike Lee's messy, meandering, bluntly polemical "Red Hook Summer" has one crucial ingredient: a raw vitality.__[The movie] isn't a smooth slow jam... but one doesn't go to Spike Lee pictures in order to solicit a complacent experience anyway.__Potently expresses, both aesthetically and narratively, a sense of inclusiveness and diversity.
Poetic justice Is served in insightful LIBERAL ARTS__For a film about aging and romanticism, "Liberal Arts" feels like it needs a more mature script.__Liberal Arts maneuvers its story in a philosophical way that is anything but detached. There's a warmth here that reminds audiences why college -- and, dare we say, their core curriculums? -- matter.__As a comedy of manners, 'Liberal Arts' is perfectly likeable.But you might find its talky touchy-feeliness on the smug side.__There are some entertaining and moving scenes here, but, overall, it's a bit softhearted for my taste.__"Liberal Arts" sticks to the syllabus of a decidedly minor movie, but its humanities faculty is first-rate.__Liberal Arts is a parfait - a light, enjoyable concoction that goes down easily but doesn't linger.__"Liberal Arts" has its bright moments and it's an enjoyable watch, but it probably won't serve up outbursts of laughter or moments of epiphany.__Radnor ... finds both wit and truth in his characters as they face, in their different ways, growing up.__It's talky, but this suits the idea of college as the last bastion of animated and engaging conversation for its own sake.__It's the kind of film that appeals powerfully to me; to others, maybe not so much.__Josh Radnor is a nice-looking, button-eyed, completely harmless sitcom personality ("How I Met Your Mother," apparently) who has gotten the impression he's a filmmaker.__An artful blend of tenderness and sharp, clear-eyed observations. Its characters talk like real people -- who also happen to be smart, appealing and thoughtful.__The harder Mr. Radnor strains to make you love his alter ego, the more resistant you become.__Radnor seems pretty impressed with the version of himself he's playing.__Like a too-ardent admirer who sends unwanted poems, the movie's squishy heart is too much.__"Liberal Arts" is a light and lively comedy of manners about college, literature and a midlife crisis that hits earlier than expected.__Elizabeth Olsen is beguiling in Liberal Arts, and Josh Radnor has a true filmmaker's eye for detail and atmosphere.__The film's trembling sincerity and preciousness betray the debt Radnor still owes to the oeuvre of Zach Braff, another sitcom star turned sad-sack independent auteur.__Full of quippy dialogue, banal observations, paper-thin characters and pat resolutions, Liberal Arts is two deodorant commercials away from being a forgettable new TV sitcom.
It's a vivid and gripping documentary (although, at two hours, somewhat longer than it needs to be), a grave indictment of a city and a system at the breaking point.__Expect your blood pressure to rise during The Central Park Five.__The doc is rife with smart or wrenching or shameful moments. The fresh interviews with the accused, now men, are invaluable.__As grim a portrait of the criminal justice system as can be imagined.__How could this second crime have occurred? The film asks that question but only partly answers it, and in the process it raises an even more troubling one.__"The Central Park Five" is a sobering indictment of racism and vigilante justice, yet it is constrained by a PBS-style deference to the very system it critiques.__"The Central Park Five" is worth seeing, both for the ways it's timeless and for the ways it encapsulates an era.__What's amazing about listening to them speak now, often through tears, is the absence of bitterness.__You'll notice something odd as you watch and your anger rises at the injustice of it all: The anger of the wrongly convicted does not.__The film offers a snapshot of the white hysteria then gripping the city, which was stoked by the tabloids and resulted in police and prosecutors railroading five black youths into prison.__An unusually good documentary about an outlandish miscarriage of justice.__Involves a detailed reconstruction of how the story broke, was developed and was dramatized by lurid tabloid headlines.__Central Park is at first discomforting, then enraging, then illuminating.__What she and her father and husband have drawn from this material is a combustible amalgam: a movie about justice violated, rectified, and denied.__A careful, thoughtful documentary that meticulously re-creates what happened on that night and details how and why everything went so terribly off-course.__Watching "The Central Park Five" is a deeply affecting experience.__A skillfully told and important story, though less factual blow-by-blow and more time spent with the five would have been more compelling.__Even as "The Central Park Five" seeks satisfactory answers, it stirs outrage and discouragement all over again.__It's still chilling to see how easily "The Central Park Five" evokes those mad days of urban distrust.__In addition to recent interviews with the five, the filmmakers deftly marshal news footage, clips from the supposed confessions, and trenchant analysis.
A riveting, horrifying film, shot through with beautifully observed moments of unwelcome truth.__Compliance is one of the toughest sits of the movie year 2012. But it's an uncompromising and, in its way, honorable drama built upon a prank call that goes on and on, getting worse and worse for the people on the other end of the line.__The point of Compliance, which caused walkouts and shouting matches when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, is how we are programmed to do things that go against our natural instincts as long as we believe we have the law on our side.__There's the adage that life is nasty, brutish and short. It's even worse when you're half-naked and locked in a supply room with your boss.__This is one insistent film, more evocative of human behavior than movies that take fewer risks ever could be.__Like a John Hughes movie hijacked by Roman Polanski, this troubling indie effort lays bare the sadomasochism of the American workplace.__A disturbing, fact-based look at the ways in which people can be bullied into bowing to the demands of authority figures.__Zobel, a second-time feature filmmaker, has put together a skillful, sympathetic but unsparing re-enactment of a small-scale atrocity, and his cast plays it out with natural, understated performances.__Zobel's masterful direction and screenplay heighten the distress of authority figures possessing unseen persuasion over naive employees, exposing a disturbing and haunting look at what some workers are willing to do in order to follow orders.__This is a well-made film, with plausible performances by all the leads, especially Ann Dowd. We feel we know people like this.__Fails its first test, which is that the audience believe every word of it.__We feel like gutless witnesses to a crime.__That the thriller is based on real incidents only magnifies its effect.__One watches in horrified fascination, and a greater horror comes when one realizes that, placed in the same kind of situation, one might react in the same way.__A harrowing, gut-wrenching fable about power and authority that shows that even the most well-adjusted, ordinary person could be tempted to degrade and dehumanize their neighbor.__Too condescending to be trusted, too manipulative to be believed, too turgid to be enjoyed, too shameless to be endured and, before and after everything else, too inept to make its misanthropic case.__There is a level of stupidity displayed by the people in this movie that beggars belief. Their behavior is to stupidity as the Death Star is to a doughnut.__Compliance ends up being about certain things that it would rather not be about.__Ultimately what is fascinating about Compliance is its suggestion of the near-universality, and ultimate mundanity, of the totalitarian reflex.__It's a deeply moral movie about the failure of morality, as grueling to watch as it is necessary.
It's not a new story, true, but "West of Memphis" makes it both extremely personal and universally painful.__We feel like we're watching an overlong true-crime television episode and not a movie.__A real-life horror story, made no less shocking by the familiarity of its early scenes.__While the "Paradise Lost" films captured events as they unfolded in the heat of battle, "West of Memphis" has the luxury of at least partial closure.__A true-crime story that begins with a notorious murder case and grows into a chilling indictment of the American justice system.__And justice for all? Hardly.__It tells the story of a terrible crime compounded by a grave injustice that's been remedied, but only in part, so it's impossible to have a single or simple response to the movie.__What sets this film apart from previous efforts to document the story is that Jackson and Walsh financed a private investigative team with legal and forensic experts who re-examined old evidence, conducted new interviews and found new witnesses.__Happy, sad, inspiring, infuriating, right and terribly wrong, all at the same time.__Berg's film is as much an indictment of the state of Arkansas' legal system as it is the prosecution.__Berg's film helps illuminate a case that should certainly be the shame of the state of Arkansas, and perhaps the criminal justice system of the entire United States.__Dubious evidence; suspicious confessions; conveniently located "poor white trash" (Echols' words) to take the rap: The case stank from the beginning, Berg's film argues.__Less an investigative report than a portrait of the community that forms around an ongoing court case, this conveys a patient understanding of the intricacies of law and human behavior that may be termed Kieslowskian.__"West of Memphis" is the fourth film about one of the most heinous cases of wrongful conviction in American judicial history. Do we need a fourth film? Yes, I think we do.__It artfully sketches out the events for anyone who's coming in cold, but basically, its strategy is to take what we already know and go deeper.__It took way too long, but the crowd finally bested the mob.__Take this as ultimately more personal journal than investigation.__The film is inspiring because it has a semi-happy ending attached to a love story.__Even if you already know the eventual outcome, the suspense as the three convicts file a last-ditch appeal is excruciating.__"West of Memphis" is nonfiction filmmaking at its best, a film with a fierce point of view yet one that doesn't pretend to have all the answers or a monopoly on truth.
A Cat in Paris is thrilling, and a thrilling example of traditional ink and paint cartooning.__[It] glories in striking silhouettes, a slinky '50s beat, a bright storybook palette and an entrancing brand of make-believe that grown-ups can believe in.__An animated delight, and certainly not just for kids.__"A Cat in Paris" has a jazzy, relaxed beauty; it's old-school, hand-drawn animation, and you sense the fun the artists were having.__At a little over an hour, it's a slight but visually charming adventure.__Like a cat nap, it gives us a brief, refreshing dream with little to remember.__"A Cat in Paris" has a low-key charm and pleasurably laconic visual style.__The graphic design and humor are whimsical, the color scheme deep and shadowy, and the perils facing Zoe and her police-inspector mom just shivery enough to give the story some spice.__It's a sweet and disquieting excursion made by filmmakers whose eyes and ears and imaginations are in marvelous sync.__ections of A Cat in Paris feel draggy even at the abbreviated running time of 65 minutes. But in the best parts, the crisscrossing plot strands all pause for a moment, and we just get to watch and listen to what's going on in this stylishly imagined world.__Seems slight and unremarkable...__There are wild chases and fever dreams, and sometimes the thieving and the thieves become a muddle. But the animation of A Cat in Paris itself is so artful, it steals the day.__A nifty little caper in which blustery gangsters, intrepid detectives, cat burglars (one of them literally feline) and a little girl named Zoe scamper across nighttime rooftops unraveling a pleasantly tangled plot.__There's hardly a frame wasted here.__Doesn't enchant.__A barely feature-length diversion that lacks the energy to grip younger viewers or the depth to impress adults, but it earns respect with its makers' dedication to old-school craft.__Unoriginal and mired in bad jokes.__It's difficult to imagine the audience for this pretty but hollow film.__This unexpected Best Animated Feature Oscar nominee is sleek, stylish animated escapade that makes vivid, affecting use of its brief running time.__A charming little French animation (not suitable for very young children,) directed by Alain Gagnol and Jean-Loup Felicioli...
Stolen begins at overdetermined, makes a pit stop at outright sadistic and winds up in the parking garage of ridiculous even for a movie of this sort.__The deep-rooted silliness makes it hard to take anything in the film seriously. But at least it has the decency never to ask us to.__In Stolen, [Cage] steals away with nothing; he's simply stalled out.__Cage is uncharacteristically muted.

There's no faulting the lyrical excellence on display. These guys are legends for a reason.__Rap confirms the art of the form from the inside.

And much of the music is tremendous.__The faces and voices are endlessly compelling as they talk about what inspires them to lay down beats and recall the early days in New York.__There's a discipline to moviemaking, too, alas, and when this effort strays from its (admittedly limited) subject to a surfeit of helicopter city shots and Ice's street prowling, it feels padded.__Something From Nothing: The Art Of Rap argues persuasively that hip hop can be disarmingly friendly, as well as an invaluable tool for social criticism and self-expression.__An insightful film about the creative talents that have made hip-hop an original, enduring American musical tradition.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
While it's not a game-changer, writer-director Ho-Cheung Pang's sharp rom-com, Love in the Buff, is a realistic portrayal of modern love in all its complexity and pain.__A romantic comedy that is as interesting for its glimpse into contemporary urban China as it is for the charisma of its leads.__Unlikely to resonate with Western audiences, who have more than enough sentimental English-language romantic comedies to keep themselves occupied.__A refreshingly authentic romantic comedy about the tradeoffs people must make in their relationships, careers and lifestyles.__Modern love shifts from Hong Kong to Beijing in the successful sequel to Love in a Puff, a natural, light and convincing rom com very similar to the original Hong Kong hit.__Buff gels into a surprisingly moving look at the machinations of the heart.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Resurrects the spirit of Middle Eastern fables, albeit with a French twist.__This dreamy, visually inventive Iranian drama functions on so many levels of reality and obsession that it almost ceases to entertain.__Chicken is a movie that begins with a crescendo and doesn't sustain its lyricism.__"Predictability" is not in Satrapi and Paronnaud's vocabulary, and that is no small thing in this or any other movie era. But the whole those parts form never exceeds their sum.__"Chicken With Plums" is a whimsical, sad, diverting and altogether delightful exploration of how cinema can benefit, not only from glancing back at its own past, but by staying open to parallel forms of presentation and play.__This highly stylized, often beautiful rumination on life and art and the choices we make just sort of lies there, waiting to expire.__For the most part it's a savory treat, much like the titular dish.__It is the story of a man who, disappointed by life and love, decides to go to bed and die. And the movie does the same - only it dies a full hour before the finish.__Chicken With Plums is not a thoroughly delectable concoction, but its exotic flavor is worth sampling.__It's not entirely satisfying, but there's plenty to savor in "Chicken With Plums."__The story lacks the historical sweep of Persepolis... this often plays like a bummed-out Amelie.__It is all melancholy and loss, and delightfully comedic, with enough but not too much magic realism.__The filmmakers rely on expressive eyes to carry a narrative style suitable for a silent movie.__The many surreal flourishes, like the film's giant breasts and petals floating through a pink-tinged sky, are supposed to be absolved of cringing obviousness because they're, you know, poetic and exotic.__This richly embroidered tale feels more anecdotal than epic, less like a fully imagined film than like a series of beguiling and beautiful pictures.__Its storytelling style is playful and self-conscious, with magically unrealist touches.__Chicken with Plums is well-acted across the board, but it is Amalric's movie.__With all the furious wand-waving, the story itself never gets to cast much of a spell.__The honest undercurrent of melancholy keeps the whole thing from becoming unmoored.__Live-action follow-up to "Persepolis" set in 1950s Iran blends humor and poetry with delightful artistry.

This is a painful drama, but its pain is more studied than emotive, and it demands that we think just as much as it makes us feel.__The cast, uniformly excellent, draws us into a vibrant, energetic Manhattan where commitments are forged and broken through sheer chance and those seeking permanence must continually resist temptation and ennui.__A complex and mysterious tale of a love affair, one that lacks the tidy story arc of a movie but feels real.__When you summon memories of this film, they are almost always of two men in a room, in a default state of discontent.__A heart-breaking love story and call for emotional transparency in relationships.__The performances are first-rate, with Lindhardt particularly moving as a guy who's in deep denial about just how much he can expect from a relationship with an addict.__The movie over-blurs the line between plain and plaintive.

Richter gives off a heroic, creator-of-the-universe air as he strains to push the squeegee, exposing a new world in his wake.__Through the documentary lens, Richter's enigmatic paintings speak to us.__Richter offers multiple explanations of how he knows when a painting is done. They range from the mundane to the lofty.__A mesmerizing look behind the curtain at a magician at work, a man who creates his enchantments not with a deck of cards or puffs of smoke but rather paint, brushes, canvas and a giant squeegee.__It shows us the world's most famous living painter, who turned 80 in February, at work with greater intimacy than any other film portrait of a contemporary artist provides.__"Gerhard Richter - Painting" is a stirring portrait of an artist in search of his art - the mystery of the process, the beauty of the hunt and the wonder of discovery.__A kind of residence with its subject rather than a report.__The sight of Richter going back and forth between two related canvases recalls Roger Federer playing tennis with himself in slow, deliberative motion.__Nearly two hours of drab, dull-as-dishwater footage of the politely taciturn painter quietly going about his business...__A documentary about the 80-year-old German artist putting paint on canvas that offers a look at the mighty mountain of creative achievement.__The film is sketchy as biography, but it proves an aging artist can still crackle with the electricity of youth.__The works in question express a delicate balance between spontaneity and rigid formal control -- seeing Richter at work is a bit like watching a great trapeze artist.__Belz delivers exactly what her title promises: the sight of Richter at work on his canvases.__Just as a document of the sheer physical labor that goes into covering a giant canvas with color, Gerhard Richter Painting is never less than absorbing.__Instead of trotting out people - friend and foe - to comment on the renowned German abstract painter, Belz allows Richter to tell his own story.__You will see the man toiling and revising-killing off half-good ideas, struggling for clarity-and it's a routine well worth demystifying.__Each swipe covers the old painting and reveals a new composition. Watching this can be fascinating, even exciting. After all, it prompts a fundamental movie question: What happens next?__Gerhard Richter Painting artfully and convincingly immerses us into the world of one of the greatest, painting.__Gerhard Richter Painting offers fascinating insight into the working process of the famed contemporary artist as he prepares a series of abstract canvases.__None
Trishna engages the potent collisions of the rural and the urban, the poor and the rich, and considers how these interactions unfold in a romance and how they might also destroy it.__While the film never delves deep enough into its characters' emotions to be truly spellbinding, it's well worth seeing.__Winterbottom has complete control of the film's look and feel, but the story seems to run away from him.__A rare unsatisfying swerve from an otherwise reliably provocative career.__"Trishna" works largely on the strength of Winterbottom's clever updates of a century-old story.__A loose but nonetheless pretty faithful recasting of Hardy's penultimate tragedy, Tess of the d'Urbervilles.__Winterbottom gives a bright panorama of Indian life, from the agrarian countryside to the tumult of Jaipur and the sophistication of Mumbai.__"Trishna" should move the soul and engage the tear-ducts, yet it passes by as distant as it is lovely. And the blame must fall on the movie's star, Freida Pinto.__Featuring a Bollywood subplot and an irresistible East-meets-West score, the movie is lush and lusty: both a strong vehicle for Pinto and a good match for Winterbottom's impressionistic style.__This escalation of passions and Trishna's humiliation demands much of both actors, yet neither Pinto nor Ahmed is completely convincing and this is the main flaw of Trishna.__The new setting revivifies the harsh forces of class and gender at work in the story.__Winterbottom is a director who never repeats himself, films all over the world, and in "Trishna," effortlessly embeds his story in modern India.__Winterbottom uses the Indian locations with a documentarian's eye and a dramatist's mind.__Spectacular visually, though awfully somber dramatically.__Pinto's lack of dramatic range (she basically has two expressions) and an awkward third act do not provide a solid foundation for Hardy's tragic ending.__As a portrait of a nation amid accelerated and profound change, "Trishna" is a vivid piece of cinema. As a melodrama, it's provocative without being emotionally involving, the central performance more distancing than engaging.__This is one of the best and bravest of recent adaptations of classic literature; if you're even a little bit intrigued, ignore what others say and don't let it pass you by.__Life is suffering, as the Buddha said (including in Hardy's emotionally grinding novels), but it's more complex and contradictory than the ginned-up realism Mr. Winterbottom delivers here.__Something in Hardy's tragic inclinations obviously appeals to Winterbottom; this is the third time he's adapted one of the author's novels, with the liberties he takes with the source material increasing each time.__By combining the characters of Lord d'Urberville and Angel Clare into one person -- spoiled rich boy Jay (Riz Ahmed, Four Lions) -- Winterbottom strips the tale of a compelling second act, making things sag terribly in the middle.
A film remarkably true to life's haphazard rhythms.__Made by a black American woman, about a black American woman, it's a study of a culture where the matriarchs are strong by necessity and trapped by circumstance - adrift in the middle of nowhere.__[A] hushed, tenderly observant drama about a young woman trying to do right by herself and her marriage while her husband is in prison.__This is a tough-minded story of change that happens in almost imperceptibly tiny increments - as true growth so often does in reality.__This film is about a particular African-American experience, true, but it's also about the human experience. It will haunt you. It should.__A sluggish enterprise, not measured or languorous or full of detail, but plodding, with scenes that run too long and others that are unnecessary.__It's confident storytelling, in which often the actors' faces, rather than dialogue, tell us what we need to know.__Middle of Nowhere explores the contours of loneliness and the boundaries of loyalty in a way that is both artful and emotionally revealing.__The love triangle, which comes to overwhelm the second half, feels more like soap opera than anything else, and the able cast can't redeem DuVernay's often dreadful dialogue.__Most of the action takes place within the mind of a lonely woman. That's why Corinealdi is so effective in the lead.__Director Ava DuVernay, in showing Ruby's life in waiting, occasionally lets the pace slip into tedium.__Corinealdi and Oyelowo are appealing enough to make the journey to the inevitable conclusion an enjoyable one.__"Middle of Nowhere" carries the imprimatur of Sundance, but without the dreary stereotypes or self-satisfied politics that can (at times unfairly) characterize its offerings.__It is uncommon to see serious adult dramas this moving and accomplished, so attuned to real people and their complex, recognizable emotions, no matter the racial makeup of the characters involved.__Like its central character, Middle of Nowhere is a gem.__This is an elegant, powerfully emotional and courageous film, worth seeing entirely on its own artistic terms ...__This modest, micro-budgeted story has been beautifully packaged.__The power of Middle Of Nowhere is cumulative, conveyed in sustained tone and deepening character rather than bravura sequences or explosive confrontations.__This is humanistic drama done right.__Remarkably self-assured ...
Sturdy performances, fine photography from Mikhail Krichman, good use of music by Philip Glass and a pleasingly terse script make for incisive, gripping drama.__In different hands, "Elena" might have been a noir thriller, but this serving of cinematic borscht is as cold as a Russian winter.__"Elena" is a riveting psychological suspense film.__A quiet, subtle mystery whose long, penetrating takes have drawn comparisons to Andrei Tarkovsky and whose mordantly ironic conclusion may remind you of Claude Chabrol.__Zvyaginstsev makes the most of the ghastly settings, which include a backyard that ominously features nuclear cones - and the kinds of compartmentalized living spaces that Hitchcock used for droll effect in "Rear Window."__It's a sort of slow-boil Russian noir, if that genre exists, and if it doesn't, it does now.__The script, by Oleg Negin and Zvyagintsev, uses spare dialogue to quietly devastating effect. Performances are superb across the board, framed in elegant widescreen compositions that simmer with violence.__Andrei Zvyagintsev's film isn't stupid or crude, and we can pretty well imagine how all the characters feel, even though it doesn't make them sympathetic.__A nicely noirish, cynically satisfying drama set in a gritty, urban Moscow that would otherwise not seem to be a haven for wildlife.__Here's a tip: Don't feel. Think. Zvyagintsev wants you to come out of "Elena" thinking something, and if your realization is an uneasy one, that's OK with him.__"Elena" reveals a filmmaker in full command of his art and not much interested in catering to an audience. If you want this film, you have to meet it more than halfway.__Naturalism lives. If Zola were a Russian in Russia today, he might have written Elena.__Performances are superb across the board, framed in elegant widescreen compositions that simmer with violence.__[A] sluggish, portentous melodrama...__'Elena" is a grim, somber portrait of life in Putin's Russia, where the haves and have-nots uneasily co-exist.__The truly terrible question asked by this quiet, haunting and magnificent film is: Dear God, isn't there some better way to live?__Deeper down, the movie seethes quietly with the moody influence of other East European masters of the timeless ineffable.__Through Markina's torn allegiances, Zvyagintsev digs deep into matters of inheritance and how much we truly owe the people we love.__Post-Soviet Russia in Andrei Zvyagintsev's somber, gripping film "Elena" is a moral vacuum where money rules, the haves are contemptuous of the have-nots, and class resentment simmers.__Elena feels a touch repetitive right when it should be tightening the screws. But its fatalism is contagious.
Dante Lam is John Woo via Michael Bay; he doesn't want to win you over, he wants to beat you up and make you crazy. And for all its silliness, "The Viral Factor" does just that.__Gunfights and explosions are audaciously played out in real urban locations swarming with people and vehicles, all unfolding with high tension, without losing sight of continuity.__It takes a special kind of action director to use chaotic, human-filled public spaces for high-energy foot chases, auto stunts and gun battles yet never once get under the skin with a sense of genuine danger.__Tediously overwrought and drably made, with scenes punctuated by synthesized drums out of eighties American TV drama.__"The Viral Factor" wants to be both an action movie and a soap opera. But the merging of the two genres by Dante Lam, a director based in Hong Kong, is clumsy, and so is the film.__It's an overloaded, overwrought, profligate production inclined to hysteria and, in cumulative effect, something like being pelted with scenes until buried alive...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Brooklyn Castle does a superb job of celebrating the triumph while reinforcing the relentless vigilance it requires from everyone involved.__Brooklyn Castle is inspiring stuff that grabs you by the throat and will leave you cheering - quietly of course. No shouting in a chess match.__There's a general spirit of triumph and perseverance to "Brooklyn Castle" that's inevitably uplifting.____"Brooklyn Castle" easily checkmates your inner cynic.__Katie Dellamaggiore's lively and affecting documentary introduces us to a cast of characters that's very winning (in both senses of the word).__It's not To Sir, With Love: It's fierce ambition, the channeling of emotion, and hours of drilling.__We meet five of the team's members and several of their teachers; by its end, you'll be rooting for them all.__Enlightening, inspiring and expertly crafted.__An irresistibly uplifting doc.__Castle is suspenseful, funny and, particularly in its depiction of the challenging home lives of some of the kids, moving.__The message is that chess can motivate working-class kids to become better students, and though that's nice to know, the movie doesn't illustrate this theme in much depth.__I don't know diddly about chess, and I still loved it.__Every player knows the finality when the other player sadly turns over his king, signaling surrender. We know it even better when we do it ourselves.__It's a wonderful documentary look at an astonishingly successful public-school chess program that manages to be more moving and heartening than you expect. Which is saying a lot.__Beyond telling the touching stories of these unlikely champions, Brooklyn Castle serves to raise a battle cry for funding for after-school programs.__Socioeconomic concerns bring depth to doc about pre-teen chess whizzes.__As inspirational academic stories go, it doesn't get much better than this.__"Brooklyn Castle'' is an engaging tale, and the principal is wrong: These kids are much more lovable than the Yankees.__It's deeply satisfying watching these public school, hard-knock kids win, and Ms. Dellamaggiore knows it.
On its own terms, "Neil Young Journeys" is an enjoyable concert film of a solo show in Toronto, interspersed with memories of his Canadian boyhood.__"Journeys" is simply a trip most need not take.__I'd say the movie does a fine job of completing the trilogy, but I wouldn't be surprised if Demme and Young have more in them yet.__The concert camera work is sometimes a little tight for comfort (not really interested in Young's bridge work), though it adds to the intensity.__Like Young, Demme often takes an iconoclastic route. This is in part a concert film, yes, but not a traditional one.__Forget Crosby, Stills and Nash and maybe even Crazy Horse. Jonathan Demme might be Neil Young's ultimate collaborator.__As a songwriter, Young can still deliver: one of the best tunes here is a lovely, piano-propelled number, "Leia," that he hasn't even released yet.__The wartsy antipode of Katy Perry: Part of Me, with an intimacy and intensity bordering on the overwhelming.__For true believers, "Neil Young Journeys" is a visit with a still-vital friend. For the merely curious, it's proof that there's more to the man - more strangeness, deeper communions with the muse - than classic rock radio will ever let on.__The point of this valuable and continuing exercise is intimacy, not nostalgia per se. Demme keeps it simple, apart from the occasionally trippy lens move.__With its one-of-a-kind poetic lamentation, Young's voice sounds more peculiarly lovely than ever. A small picture, but good and true.__It's an intimate performance portrait, divided among new material from his 2010 album "Le Noise" and many of his classics.__More casual fans will twist in their chairs uncomfortably, wishing that a roadie would walk up and wipe it off. Neil Young die-hards will cherish the spittle.__A feast for Neil Young lovers and initiates alike.__What's the point of this particular project? Why - apart from any marketing concerns - did either artist feel it was essential to capture this concert on film?__The nicest thing I can think of to say about the doc "Neil Young Journeys" is that at least it isn't in 3-D.__Mr. Young's passionate cracked whine assumes an oracular power.__Young's almost mystical musicianship is what saves it.__Neil Young Journeys underscores the continuing relevance of Young's artistry over the last 45 years and why he is regarded as one of rock's most influential musicians and songwriters.__Of course, the music is the thing and the sounds here earn Demme's reverence.
"Tai Chi Zero" is often more distracting than diverting with its everything-goes aesthetic - there are strains of steampunk, manga and silent film comedy, with video-game touches.__"Tai Chi Zero" is loads of fun to watch, especially a battle in which watermelons, bananas and other fruits and veggies serve as flying weapons.__A martial-arts adventure with more video-game and comic-book DNA than the traditional kung fu flick, "Tai Chi Zero" is good, if empty-headed, fun.__Exhausting to watch, Tai Chi Zero is all flash and little substance.__"Zero" is the first part of a trilogy. Part two, titled "Tai Chi Hero," is due in January. The legend is off to a promising start.__Fung is enjoying himself so much that he doesn't want the movie to end - and his delight is infectious.__Tai Chi Zero, the first film in a planned trilogy, will leave hard-core fight enthusiasts wanting. But it's a droll, pleasant diversion all the same.__Fast and mostly fun, the movie also seems compulsively too much, throwing everything it can think of at you, lest it fail to entertain.__For all its playfulness and cameo one-shots ("Lung Siu-lung, '70s kung fu superstar"!), Fung's film represents a thundering dead end.__The cross-cultural, steampunk, martial arts/comic-book Sino-Anglo mash-up...[is]visually entertaining. But...its considerable charms may prove exhausting before its relatively brief, 95-minute run time is over.__Give some points to a genre flick whose style mash-up reflects uneasy relations between Asia and the West just as its fracas-intensive plot tries to dramatize them.__If director Stephen Fung's frenetic visual style is the Red Bull in this cinematic cocktail, then the dozy plotting is the vodka-leaving you feeling momentarily excited but ultimately narcotized.__The story's fundamentals are solid, and the battles between this village of kung fu experts and an army of 19th century technophiles are so good that the inevitable sequel (already in the works) will be welcome.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
[O]ne of the best based-on-facts police pictures.__Whatever you think of it, you won't be neutral.__Bluntly edited, with no hand-holding transitional scenes, the film is an intimate portrait of an idealistic, understaffed, sometimes wrongheaded team battling youth prostitution, thievery rings and adult predators from every class of society.__"Polisse" draws us uncomfortably close to a taboo subject then rewards us with real nourishment.__Has an infectious energy and aims for a bottom-up, slice-of-life air characterised by naturalistic performances and a fly-on-the-wall shooting style.__It's messy, boring, funny, suspenseful, touching, jubilant and tragic.__A fascinating multicharacter drama about the police who work in Paris' child protection unit.__Rarely does one see a movie so knowing in some respects and so clueless in others.__All the tears I shed were hard-earned. So were all the laughing and clapping and eye-covering.__The mosaic of cases and caseworkers is like a season of The Wire distilled into two hours.__The film's director and co-writer is Maiwenn, an actress and now third-time filmmaker, who is accomplished at following several story lines and weaving them together.__[It] reveals, in a time of political turbulence, some of the subtle peculiarities of French society.__Over the film's more-than-two-hour running time we are immersed in the lives of these cops as they attempt both to see justice done and to preserve their sanity.__Inspired by a documentary, the film is shot with verite immediacy and beautifully acted by an outstanding ensemble.__While never exploitative, "Polisse" can be extremely disturbing.__[A] long, unruly, gripping film.__What makes it such a singular experience is the convergence of fine acting, moral urgency and a willingness to linger on moments of great intensity.__As humane as it is disturbing, Polisse rifles the files of Paris' Child Protection Unit in search of successes, failures and all the shades of ambiguity in between.__The details will gut you, and then haunt your dreams.__Polisse has trouble sometimes hiding the seams between the two, but when it works, it doesn't look like it's being staged at all.
There's not much interpersonal drama here, and the little that materializes gets promptly resolved.__Watching this movie, I feel the need to run to the mall or someplace, and find a Chinese baby to hug. Or, at least, I can hug my own daughters.__A very affecting piece.__Documentarian Linda Goldstein Knowlton follows four teenage adoptees as they sort through the sensitive cultural and personal issues that arise from their dual identities.__In this poignant movie we meet four Chinese-born teenagers who are living with American parents from Berkeley to Boston.__These girls - and Ruby - have traveled far, on a journey not yet finished; you sense, though, that they know their way home.__All the girls in this film speak candidly. Sometimes their words sound like poetry. Sometimes their words are poetry.__It's a testament to the human stories, not the filmmaking, that some moments unleash a deeply affecting drama with a high potential for tears.__A play-it-safe, by-the-numbers kind of documentary - yet somehow it gets under your skin.__You'd have to be a stone not to be moved.__"Somewhere Between" presents an effortlessly moving but superficial profile of four bright Chinese girls and their adoptive American families.__All have their own stories, but the common narrative in these "trans-racial" kids' lives is the strength it takes to be who you are and to flourish when identity is becomes one more challenge.__A warm-hearted if somewhat over-orchestrated documentary that gives voice to four teenaged adoptees from loving but very different homes.__The film is overcrowded with story lines and short on thrust, but fortunately, its protagonists carry the day with their candor and precocious poise.__Knowlton never delves far enough into her subjects' stories for Somewhere Between to feel more nuanced than, say, a good commercial for international child-adoption services.____None__None__None__None
The movie's indictment would be more persuasive had Jarecki recognized that his audience likely already knows most of what he recaps, and can handle the odd scrap of ambiguity.__"The House I Live In" leaves you shaking your head in deadened wonder at the waste of it all.__Tells a complex story with troubling ease.__The House I Live In is a work of journalism, not propaganda: Jarecki has done his research and leaves it to you to decide what to make of it.__If [it] takes a while to focus, it eventually becomes the conversation starter the subject desperately needs.__Jarecki takes a highly original approach to create a compelling, thought-provoking look at a highly relevant and controversial topic.__An absorbing, disturbing sit.__It's a film as profoundly sad as it is enraging and potentially galvanizing, and it's one of the most important pieces of nonfiction to hit the screen in years.__Jarecki's case is so compelling that, when he concludes by comparing the drug war to the Holocaust, the obvious charge of hyperbole doesn't quite stick.__Jarecki's film makes a shattering case against the War on Drugs ...__[Jarecki's] analysis is far too simplistic.__The evidence Jarecki amasses against the drug wars in "The House I Live In" is more than strong enough to withstand any excess rhetorical zeal.__A model of the ambitious, vitalizing activist work that exists to stir the sleeping to wake.__A very potent movie.__Jarecki's documentary assembles [its arguments] deftly, with much help from former crime reporter David Simon, who left the Baltimore Sun to become the auteur of such mean-streets TV dramas as The Wire.__An empathetic, if not entirely persuasive, look at an ongoing national dilemma.__Jarecki demonstrates all the ways that the ''war'' has become futile in The House I Live In, but also how it is now an unstoppable industry, with privatized prisons run as economic engines.__Whenever the film focuses more on Jarecki's hand-wringing than deconstructing the war itself, you wish someone would have looked the filmmaker in the eye and just said no.__What's riveting and attention grabbing in Jarecki's recapitulations of failed policy are some of the talking heads he has assembled ...__Powerful doc argues that the War on Drugs needs a dramatic rethinking.
Though the story spirals a little out of control in the film's final scenes, "The Awakening" offers the low-key pleasures of an old-fashioned thriller and a lovely central performance.__Whatever.__The cast is anchored by two wonderful actresses: Imelda Staunton and Rebecca Hall, whose talents are squandered on this lackluster horror drama.__When these sudden surprises work, as in "A Beautiful Mind" or "The Others," you're too stunned to swallow that next handful of popcorn; when they don't, you're tempted to throw your whole box at the screen.__A dull British import that never lives up to the pretensions of its period setting.__An enjoyably old-fashioned ghost story in the vein of "The Others" and "The Orphanage."__"The Awakening" is nonsense, but with its posh British cast and colors drained to near-gray, it's very solemn nonsense.__A lot of tension and buildup leads us to ... well, it's hard to say.__"The Awakening" takes so many unnecessary twists and turns that the final one, which should be a biggie, ends up feeling inconsequential.__For all of its airs of refinement, "The Awakening" is pretty stale stuff.__The film benefits enormously from having the luminous Rebecca Hall as its lead. It also gains an ominous gravity from the haunted, wounded and wobbly England in which it's set.__This stately chiller owes a lot to 1960s British flicks like "The Innocents" and "The Haunting," but unfortunately heads towards cliches with every step.__There is nothing in the film that will keep you awake at night. Instead, "The Awakening" works much more subtly, with a profound sense of dread and resignation, a death-obsessed movie given life by Hall's performance.__It's routine stuff as horror setups go, especially if you've seen such obvious influences as The Orphanage and The Others.__The Awakening is both a ghost story and an exploration of mourning and survivor's guilt, though a late twist turns the film away from its delicate merging of these two themes into something both more plotty and stilted.__This handsomely made spook story (love those echo-prone hallways!) becomes less involving the more the narrative's mysteries are solved.__Hall's committed performance validates even the maddest developments, and she slips into the period well, recalling Virginia Woolf in her lank, swan-necked bearing and tremulous suffering.__If cinema is a dream, 'The Awakening,' I suppose, has just enough oomph to keep you hitting snooze__Dominic West personifies the melancholia of a country overwhelmed by death.__Nick Murphy's bigscreen directorial debut has good atmospherics that only go so far to prop up a mystery whose overdue explanation is convoluted and underwhelming.
"Little White Lies" is a bit too long, but has plenty of Gallic charm.__A sprawling, initially engaging French comedy-drama that became a hit in France but ultimately underwhelms.__The script is banal, but the acting company and the locations are easy on the eyes.__The overall tone of "Little White Lies" feels off, or maybe it just doesn't translate to American audiences.__At times, it's amusing. At times, it's tragic. At times, it's romantic. But, like many vacations, it's way, way too long.__As the movie wears on ... the melodrama amps up to a final scene capable of draining any remaining pathos.__Little White Lies wants to capture something momentous and meaningful in these people's lives. But ultimately it's hard to care.__There's a fly-on-the-wall quality to it that adds a voyeuristic zing to the proceedings and gives this French take on "The Big Chill" its particular warmth.__It's just that, when it's over, 2 1/2 hours seems too big an investment for just pretty good.__The movie is 154 minutes long. It probably doesn't need to be that long, but there's an advantage to sinking into this milieu, growing familiar with the characters and learning their stories.__The trouble with Guillaume Canet's French gloss on The Big Chill is that it has no underlying chill.__A film this long should end with the audience feeling it knows the characters like old friends. Instead it ends with an outside observer delivering an insight that isn't really an insight.__Pretty easy to take, and not just because of the lovely photography of the French coast, all oyster farms and pink wine and long dinners under the trees. Because there are also these wonderful performers.__With an ensemble led by Marion Cotillard and Francois Cluzet, the French hit has personality to burn, and squanders most of it.__Little White Lies simply tries too hard.__Although these friends have some fun horsing around in the water, their conflicts and rivalries make for a tense, joyless holiday that is anything but relaxing.__A movie built from strung-together set pieces.__Can tout a gorgeous setting, a group of appealing actors and a mastery of the art of wine-fueled conversation.__Little White Lies' fundamental problem is that it's hard to empathize with characters who have so little empathy themselves.__Canet's melodrama has earned the snarky sobriquet "the Gallic Big Chill" on the festival circuit, but that's giving this mush way too much credit.
Earnestness and obviousness compete for supremacy early on in Don Handfield's film, with the latter fully in front; happily, earnestness stages a comeback by the end.__A lightweight and overlong feel-good drama that plays like a mashup of It's a Wonderful Life and Friday Night Lights.__Are any of them alone reason enough to sit through two hours of warmed-over life lessons? Not particularly, but it should be said that the cast and crew have made a fair stride towards redeeming earnest low-budget filmmaking of this ilk...__If George Bailey had been a high school football hero, It's a Wonderful Life might have been a little like Touchback.__Touchback takes a handoff from Peggy Sue Got Married and It's A Wonderful Life and runs it up the middle for a modest gain.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
____10 Years is no Big Chill, but it has just enough warmth to keep it alive.__A bracingly un-gimmicky, heartfelt and fresh take on the theme of growing up.__Even the most exhausted, hackneyed and innately annoying genre can yield a film of breezy charm and prickly dramatic consequence.__An inconsequential high-school-reunion comedy that gets better when it stops trying to make you laugh.__Linden manages to overcome what would seem to be a premise fraught with peril with a lot of help from a likable cast, making "10 Years" a surprisingly enjoyable movie.__'10 Years' is a surprisingly solid variation on a familiar tune.__Writer/director Jamie Linden and his excellent cast beautifully evoke the sentimental magic inherent in their scenario.__Needless to say, everybody comes equipped with their very own overweight baggage; old grudges are revived, new ones are invented; and big personal revelations -- most of which you can see coming a mile away -- arrive on cue.__It's too bad 10 Years isn't, you know, funny.__Even when the script seems ready to settle for cliche - with cavemen guys being civilized by the more evolved women in their life - it takes a slight detour.__Is there anything less narratively interesting than a high school reunion that focuses exclusively on the beautiful and popular crowd? Who all now seem to be leading normal, if flawed, lives?__There's a lot of been-there, done-that going on. That said, this very distant, slightly more youthful cousin to The Big Chill presents a convincing version of a 10-year high school reunion.__An unpretentious, well-acted ensemble piece that doesn't aspire to be a portentous generational time capsule like "The Big Chill," "American Graffiti" or "Diner."__10 Years does nothing noteworthy, but it does it well, thanks to its ensemble cast.__A strong cast convincingly captures the many ways in which adulthood proves far more complicated than what's imagined at 18.__An amiable, seriocomic high-school-reunion movie, 10 Years succeeds in pulling off a fine varsity talent show.__There's a relaxed, unforced, melancholy sweetness and swing to this modest iteration of the Big Chill/Return of the Secaucus 7 formula, a pleasing directorial debut for screenwriter Jamie Linden.__Less fun than a funeral.
Too much of "Any Day Now" founders in cliche and predictable table-turning and point-scoring instead of building a set of complicated characters at odds with a biased system.__The growing community of gay parents deserves a better reflection of their struggles than a kitschy "Kramer vs. Kramer."__Switches between a few primary modes -- agenda-mentary, romance, courtroom drama, tearjerker -- without engaging very convincingly in any of them.__Generally abysmal.__Gets its point across, and its sad drama. And it spotlights a marvelous performance by Alan Cumming.__Cumming is wonderful, and you know something? Trying a little understanding sure doesn't hurt.__There's no denying the power of Cumming, Leyva and Dillahunt's performances, nor the tragedy and injustice of the situation.__The film is sometimes swamped by its own tears.__Cumming is the linchpin, and the actor does an exceptional job of moving across the vast galaxy of universal emotions about partners and parenthood. He takes us to the heart of the matter in ways that matter most.__An outraged, unblinking depiction of institutionalized homophobia three decades ago, when the prevailing court opinion in adoption cases was that exposing a child to a homosexual environment was harmful.__It would take a heart of stone - or zero tolerance for soap - to resist Any Day Now, a full-throttle weepie about a West Hollywood gay couple trying to adopt a neglected boy with Down syndrome.__The script seems almost religiously adverse to Hallmark-style melodrama.__Any Day Now, about a gay couple in '70s LA trying to adopt a boy with Down syndrome, has movie-of-the-week melodrama written all over it. But it rises above the saccharin thanks to strong performances.__Director Travis Fine gives his period details flourish and lets Cumming and Dillahunt create well-rounded characters, but "Any Day Now" winds up treacly.__The bare-bones script is fleshed out by Cumming and Dillahunt, who create characters that are as memorable as they are moving.__Cumming and Dillahunt are so terrific-as is Isaac Leyva as their ward-that they pull Any Day Now up from its more maudlin and melodramatic elements.__The intent is righteous. The dramatic overkill is deadly.__Straining for "teachable moments," the film has one noteworthy, unintentional function: to remind us that though LGBT rights are continually evolving, the laws of kitsch remain immutable.__Acting from beneath the least flattering haircut this side of the Bee Gees, Cumming delivers what is possibly his best performance to date.__Alan Cumming has never been nominated for an Oscar, but director Travis Fine's powerful, fact-based movie could be the breakthrough role that makes it happen.
[T]he sort of film in which every detail feels unforced but essential.__Here is a film with the clarity of fresh stream water, flowing without turmoil to shared destiny. No plot gimmicks. No twists and turns. Just a simple life.__An exquisite and wise moment of celluloid portraiture.__Often poignant but leavened with humor.__Though overlong, Hui's valentine never milks the drama for tears, maintaining an unsentimental focus on the central duo's playful chemistry and the loving way Ah Tao's attention to detail is repaid.__Ms. Hui, a rare successful female director in the Hong Kong film industry, drew her story from real events, and the movie retains a tonic flavor of the everyday: its drama unfolds simply, without explosive moments but not without emotion__Gingerly peels layer after layer of sharp insights into the dynamics of familial love, using compassion and droll humor as its tools.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
__The incomprehensible back story didn't dim my enjoyment much. The movie is a crackerjack audio-visual thrill ride.__Fans, go be with your people. Others, approach cautiously.__The widescreen canvas is an improvement over television's limited expanse. But if you're not among the indoctrinated, don't bother.__This is a very intelligent, well-plotted story - and my hunch is that we have not seen the last of our heroes.__At some point you have to ask: When are fantasy fans going to tire of heroes and villains throwing bolts of energy at each other? Give it a rest already!__Soporific exposition culminates in a visually chaotic final act that makes "Tintin'' look downright restrained.__Like a lot of anime, the movie remains entertaining even when you have no idea what's going on.__It's silly and excessive, but Fullmetal Alchemist occasionally strikes a note of adolescent truth, as when Ed wishes for "some way to get our bodies back."__Pic upholds the series' trademark use of pacey action and well-defined characters struggling against oppression and seeking answers to spiritual questions.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Its mostly observant temper keeps us from being greatly moved, but it holds us with its acute, almost laboratory dissection of its people's beings.__A movie with more plot than it can comfortably handle.__It's all intended to be darkly metaphorical. In actuality, it's a mediocre film unfolding without plan, purpose or enthusiasm.__With a rucksack of gadgets, Dafoe makes a believably cunning tracker, and when he finally confronts his prey, the mutual respect feeds a poignant parable.__Not much happens in "The Hunter." And what little does happen, happens very slowly. And then is repeated.__The character arc is strong on paper but not well-realized on film, and therein lies The Hunter's greatest failing.__By the time The Hunter jettisons its narrative ballast altogether and embraces its elemental appeal, it's too late.__The film is really Dafoe's show, and he reminds once again why he is such a tremendous actor and also one so easy to underestimate and take for granted.__Nettheim films long stretches without dialogue and lets the landscape take centre stage, relying on Robert Humphreys' superb camerawork to tell the story.__Mostly this is just too mild, too quiet, too distant. It tracks its target. But it never quite manages to get it in its sites.__Dafoe proves to have the right blend of ruggedness and sensitivity for this conflicted hero.__"The Hunter" is engrossing and thoughtful entertainment. It's a mystery with a message.__"The Hunter" loses its way.__Dafoe invests every action with a sense of purpose (not, thankfully, the same thing as meaning), to the extent that viewers would likely turn up to watch him peel potatoes, Jeanne Dielman-style.__"The Hunter" doesn't particularly test him, but Dafoe, who's in every scene of the film, easily dominates it.__Alas, just when you'd like the movie to double down, a la Peter Weir's Witness, on its cryptic hero's rebirth, he's yanked back into an abrupt close that feels rushed and poorly linked.__A thriller brooding with disquiet and dread.__The Hunter is too many films in one...__"The Hunter" never declares who is good or bad or right or wrong.

It would be unfair and patronizing to say that Solondz needs to grow up, but "Dark Horse" suggests that it's time for the bard of bourgeois hypocrisy to consider moving on.__Solondz has made a career out of specializing in highly aberrant views of middle-class life.__That Gelber can make Abe appealing in any way is a triumph. That Solondz can orchestrate such a feat is an even bigger one.__Solondz will never be much for happy endings, but the film is strangely optimistic and at times borders ever-so-slightly on the whimsical.__With champion bloodlines from Walken and Farrow, "Dark Horse" could have been a contender, but it gets so skittish about trodding a familiar path that it pulls up lame.__For once, Solondz seems less interested in scoring points off his characters than in creeping into their shy, sad interior worlds.__Todd Solondz, the dean of depressive comedy, is back with another funny, shocking, emotionally probing original.__[Solondz] pulls one too many narrative stunts, with one too many dream sequences, calling into question the reality of everything that's happened - including that soap-operatic finale.__[A] wonderfully realized and surprisingly understated dark satire...__You have to admire the filmmaker for what he has achieved thus far in Dark Horse, and mourn Abe's premature departure from the action.__As awful as Abe is, you can't help rooting for him as he struggles to get his life in order, all while his vivid fantasy world seems to be closing in on him.__Solondz's latest, 'Dark Horse', is similar to his first film, 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' (1995), in the way it piles cruelties on one misguided character.__Even though Todd Solondz' latest journey into suburban dysfunction may seem dark (and is), it's also about joy, and how easily it's wasted.__Abe may deserve all that comes to him, but the question of how he got this way sustains the picture, against all odds.__There are times when it is dark humor, and then times when it is simply dark. But there is something more going on here, something deeper and more ... hopeful?__The most squirm-inducing aspect of Dark Horse is the way that Solondz is still stuck in his outdated loser tropes.__Solondz is a minor master of black comedy-the flattened emotional responses, the grotesque non sequiturs, the perverse desires lurking under a bland surface.__It's tough to get on Todd Solondz's wavelength, but boy is it worth the emotional gyrations.__Characters turn out to have improbable secret lives, or pop in and out like hallucinations. Plotlines that start to satisfy, attitudes that start to make sense, are ruthlessly upended.__It's a typical Solondz sad-sack tale, but this film seems to be disgusted by its own characters, which isn't true of the director's best work.
"The Big Picture" ends perhaps a bit too ambiguously, but there's something refreshing about its faith in the moviegoer's intelligence.__Director Eric Lartigau tells the story slowly, less interested in suspense than in character.__Takes familiar material - involving a violent crime and an assumed identity - and nudges it just enough to keep us interested for most of the ride.__It moves, with supple muscularity, toward a twisty and satisfying conclusion.__Duris is excellent, his hair and eyes growing wilder with each step of the journey, and he has solid support ...__A dark little fable, the story of two separate roads that briefly intersect - and what happens when a man suddenly jumps from one mapped journey to the other.__The movie has the intense psychological focus of the late Claude Chabrol, if not Chabrol's graceful camerawork.__If some of the plot details defy credibility, Romain Duris's electrifying performance makes you overlook any inconsistencies, as his likable character becomes a man on the run barely able to stifle his panic.__This existential thriller is about a person who seeks personal freedom by becoming somebody else.__For most of the way, right up until a hastily contrived and deeply unsatisfying ending, the film perceptively sketches a fractured identity, a man who enters a new life carrying painful remnants of the old.__Even [Duris] can't fully salvage a last act that clumsily tries to sell the notion that white-knight altruism is the ultimate creative satisfaction.__For most of the film, Lartigau creates the tension of a Hitchcockian thriller solely through Paul's interior struggle ...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Crazy Horse could be condensed to its advantage.__The idea is to be erotic, seductive, but often, through Wiseman's unforgiving lens, the effect is more anatomical, aloof, amusing.__If there's one thing that's both surprising and predictable about "Crazy Horse" it's how thoroughly unsexy the film is.__Wiseman is a still-prolific luminary of what has been dubbed "direct cinema," a documentary style in which the director intrudes as little as possible and conducts no on-camera interviews.__If nothing else, you'll surely relish the extravagant rhetoric used by Ali Mahdavi, the club's artistic director, to describe what is basically a tasteful nudie revue.__The most interesting dynamic exists between director Philippe Decoufle and artistic director Ali Mahdavi.__The revue and the film are chic, antiseptic and curiously asexual.__The performers, who (spoiler alert) look pretty good, are neither sentimentalized nor unduly ennobled by Wiseman.__So warm, colorful, and sensuous that it seems like a real anomaly for the highly disciplined filmmaker.__The Crazy Horse Saloon in Paris is famous for its "erotic chic" revues, but I found nothing either erotic or chic in this reduction of body parts to geometrical displays.__It's a fascinating behind-the-scenes view, right down to the delivery man who blandly deposits a bag of takeout backstage.__It is a deft revelation of shared humanity, the kind of thing no one does better than Frederick Wiseman.__Wiseman's are the movies to show to the aliens when they arrive.__Wiseman freely, unobtrusively prowls the joint to create a movie that respects the serious work involved in simulating the sensations of pleasure.__The spectacle lodges somewhere between erotic reverie and the perfection of a revolving sculpture.__A film that firmly belies the assumption that "fly on the wall" implies an absence of cinematic effect.__It's undeniably interesting to watch each element come into place, from choreography to costumes. But the truth is, most viewers will best appreciate the retro-sexy dance numbers themselves.__Part performance film, part backstage documentary, Crazy Horse is familiar in form, yet remarkable both for its subject and for who's sitting in the director's chair.__Wiseman's methodology favors the vocal, so we hear more from the choreographers and the directors than we do from the actual performers, and that somewhat throws off the balance of what we learn about the goings-on here.__Sexploitation and art blend uneasily in "Crazy Horse,'' by the renowned documentarian Frederick Wiseman.
This Paris-based film from Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska is a fairly unengaging journalism procedural shellacked with a veneer of elliptical, complicated symbolism.__Writer-director Malgorzata Szumowska breaks past the facile moralizing only once.__"Elles" has a surprisingly deep performance in a disappointingly shallow movie.__Binoche is the disappointment. More than half the problem is that the script, co-written by the director, gives her little to do but fret and mope.__One of her (Binoche's) lesser choices.__Both provocative and muddled, the film's a moody, passive-aggressive tract that's buoyed by superior performances and sunk by its own uncertainties.__This is not an entirely new idea. Nor does "Elles" offer any new insights into either domestic slavery or sex work. But it does offer a lot of sex, which for some will be just fine.__"Elles" is provocative company, but it leaves us feeling hustled.__Szumowska provides lurid scenes of perverted sex, but she offers no new insight into the sordid world of prostitution and the dangers sex workers face.__The acting by Binoche and her two young co-stars is more nuanced than the film deserves.__In case you have forgotten, all women are prostitutes, and all men are johns.__The sex scenes are attention-getting, but Elles is most remarkable as a naturalistic portrait of a woman.__As an essay on women's roles in society and cross-generational female desire, the film provides many questions with no easy answers.__Elles is racy and often sexy, but underneath that simmers an old-school feminist anger.__Titillation and tentative stabs at gender studies do not a cogent cri de coeur make. It's simply a provocation that's all hopped up with nowhere to go.__It's entirely too much for co-writer/director Malgoska Szumowska to coherently flesh out in an hour and a half, especially with so much time dedicated just to the state of arousal.__It feels like a portrait of a fleeting bourgeois crisis, something Binoche performs well but which feels skin deep when the film is flirting with more fleshy issues.__Director Malgorzata Szumowska seems intent on drowning her film and her leading lady in campy erotic imagery.__None__None
What a beautiful and desperate film.__[An] absorbing French drama.__The movie takes a refreshingly low-key, observational approach to storytelling ...__"Sister" avoids sentimental indulgence. There's no room for wallowing in this spare, almost ascetic exercise ...__French-born director and co-screenwriter Ursula Meier balances the scenario's bleak, wrenching aspects with a stirring confidence in the redemptive power of love.__Seydoux perfectly captures the anger and self-defeat of ill-educated, hedonistic, man-chasing young women who live on the fringes.__Lea Seydoux fulfills Louise, and Kacey Mottet Klein, as Simon, is one more to join the pantheon of film's excellent child actors.__Klein and Seydoux give such naturalistic performances that they're never overwhelmed by the spectacle.__Haunting and sad. And absolutely worth seeing.__An unusual, involving, slightly strained character study from Ursula Meier, the French director of 2008's satirical dystopia, 'Home'.__The chemistry between the two leads is a razor's-edge dance: feral, childish, tender and always complex.__Movies about wayward kids are a European specialty. The new film "Sister" deepens the specialty.__The influence of Belgian masters Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne's documentary eye for youth on the margins is evident in Ursula Meier's calmly heartbreaking drama.__It's a terrific, bracingly sad movie.__Meier's tight focus on her primary characters pays off: Seydoux brings a strong array of emotions to a highly unsympathetic part.__A cool yet compassionate look at two people bound by love and shared struggles in a world of haves and have-nots.__A work of precocious depth by Ursula Meier ("Home"), who's nervy enough to enlist the Alps as a metaphor, and inject a story of family dysfunction with just enough politics to make it a parable.__A penetrating study of familial bonds, quietly devastating in parts, beautiful on whole and destined to make you fall in love with a practiced and entirely amoral preteen thief.__The script turns a little melodramatic, although Meier's tone remains clinical.__In spite of a setting that has characters in need co-existing with chalet-dwellers, Meier resists the temptation to contrast the noble scrappers with the grotesques who have it all.
An exquisitely crafted, brilliant, confusing, disordered, maddening, and wonderfully flawed film that tries to show life as it is lived.__It creates the lived-in sense of being in the world of the characters.__Bouquet and the waterways of Venice are the chief charms of Techine's movie, which is otherwise one of his less convincing efforts.__What makes the film involving is that it doesn't depend on the mechanical resolution of the plot, but on the close observation of its effects on these distinctive characters.__[Unforgivable] sets out as an account of unusual lives, finishes as a portrait of a society -- one that lives between the conventional and the openly low.__It's clearly the work of a master storyteller, conveying a rich, novelistic sense of character and a poetic feeling for the passing of time.__The way Techine holds them up to the film's unforgiving light, they sometimes seem less like people than like insects in a jar.__Techine lavishes upon us not just scenery and characters but complications and emotional turmoil in pursuit of subtlety. If this seems perverse, it most certainly is.__An elegantly rambling Franco-Italian affair about the ways we do each other wrong while trying to do each other right.__Every single player in Unforgivable is worth a movie of his or her own. The fact that they are all in the same movie together is more boon than bust.__The movie is intriguing and racy, but not always convincing.__There's something in this story that lingers, too, like the Venetian sunset, as we watch these people, rich and poor, acting foolishly, selfishly, sometimes even hurtfully.__Both Venice and Bouquet are photographed to ravishing effect, and like the city, Judith is meant to suggest something trapped into being a fantasy for others.__Literate, intelligent and a model of accomplished European filmmaking, "Unforgivable" showcases the kind of emotional complexity that is all but gone from the screen these days.__"Unforgivable" isn't one of Mr. Techine's greatest achievements, but it's engrossing even when its increasingly populated story falters, tripped up by unpersuasive actions, connections and details.__Without fully realized characters, the film's major moments - each cutting remark and humiliating act - feel hollow.__The jumble of characters and plotlines remain indistinct and removed throughout.__[An] elliptical and somewhat loopy drama about the slipperiness of love at any age...__All are wounded souls, and all try their best, even if their acts are less than virtuous.__Techine piles a staggering amount of incident into 111 minutes, ever pushing the narrative forward and never letting scenes dawdle.
Ceylan's own growing reputation will, I hope, continue to grow. He uses the realistic film as an avenue to what lies around and beyond the realism.__It runs 157 minutes, and I can't say you don't feel them. You do - but in the way you would, reading a very good book in an uncomfortable chair.__A movie of such dark, smoldering intensity that it's easy to forget that half of it takes place in near darkness.__A police procedural as existential inquiry, set in a remote dreamscape of mystery and foreboding.__Ceylan's visual style is less heightened, more down-to-earth than the more stylised 'Three Monkeys', but still some of the night-time scenes look like careful paintings, such is the precision of their lighting and composition.__Ceylan doesn't slap us with big dramatic moments, but allows us to live along with his characters as things occur to them.__It is epic in its aims and achievements yet modest in its resources: some superb actors, stunning landscapes and a resonant, understated script.__A gorgeously shot crime story with emotionally layered characters and an indelible atmosphere of unease.__This painstaking but gorgeously realized police procedural by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, the Turkish poet of the long take, nods to Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West.__It is colossally, memorably and audaciously boring, but if you stick with it - and I am not advising this - something may happen.__Ceylan is as calculatedly withholding a storyteller as ever, and as one might expect, Anatolia never comes right out and explains itself, though the men's free-ranging conversations suggest the film has much on its mind.__A long, slow haul but for the willing, a haunting journey into the heart of darkness in Turkish Anatolia.__Gorgeous to look at, intriguing to think about and, at times, hard to sit through.__Ceylan's mesmerizing existential drama takes its time establishing the players and bringing their inner lives into focus. It's cinema as autopsy.__A subtle, gorgeous and mysterious allegory that may be Ceylan's masterwork to date.__Turn the movie this way, and it's a police procedural that's tragicomically heavy on minutiae while slyly suggesting that official evidence always lies. Turn it that way, and it's an existential fairy tale set in a nocturnal netherworld.__Anatolia wanders into an open-ended verbal bout between the laws of nature and the laws of man, yet the sense of actual musing, much less the mythic storytelling jokingly suggested by its title, dissolves from being to nothingness.__There is very little overt drama. The camera waits, and watches, like a vulture.__Patient viewers will be rewarded, as long as they pay attention.__A metaphysical road movie about life, death and the limits of knowledge, "Once Upon a Time in Anatolia" has arrived just in time to cure the adult filmgoer blues.
"Simon and the Oaks" branches out in ways unusual and interesting enough to hold your attention and then even shake it a bit.__The sheer sincerity of everyone concerned bolsters the whole enterprise so that Ohlin's historical novel-on-film holds us.__"Simon and the Oaks" is not merely the story of two boys from opposite sides of the tracks. It's also a larger meditation on life's hardships and what endures: love, art and civilization.__With its fool's-gold cinematography, over-emphatic musical score and self-important protagonist, "Simon and the Oaks" is a puny acorn that dreams it's a towering achievement.__[A] lush, handsomely crafted middlebrow epic ...__It's a warmly done family and personal drama that seems to cover familiar territory, but only up to a point and very much in its own way.__With beautiful period trappings and picturesque backdrops, the film doesn't skimp on visual details, though the resulting product is inert.__Poetic, romantic and idealistic, it begins in 1939 and concludes after the end of World War II.__The classical music is soothing, the cinematography handsome and the acting strong, but the Swedish coming-of-age saga "Simon and the Oaks'' is burdened with a sappy, soap-opera-ish script.__With its exhilarating World War II narrative and performances that touch notes intimate and grand, "Simon and the Oaks" has an exquisite, and epic, ache.__It is what it is, which is emphatically not enough to bear the weight of genocide.__Though it retains the narrative complexity of the Swedish bestseller on which it's based, WWII saga Simon and the Oaks never creates an emotional or intellectual throughline of its own.__Ohlin enhances the historical melodramatics with immaculate period details, but the film never finds the right mix of the epic and the intimate-the personal as seen through the 20th century's Euro-geopolitical turmoil-that it aims for.__Simon and the Oaks has all the superficial elements of compelling drama but none of the interiority; it looks like a good movie without ever actually feeling like one.__The life of the mind trumps family ties in Swedish coming-of-age tale.__None__None__None__None__None
Every performance works, every character fits, every observation rings true.__What's so remarkable about the happiness the film brings is its simplicity.__Like a train, "I Wish" is slow to build momentum, then it carries us away in a wondrous rush.__You watch it remembering the days when you should have walked but simply had to run, and when you believed that, if you wished hard enough, your dead pet just might come back again.__What a kind and wise movie this is.__[The] film is built around performances by two real-life brothers who are as unaffected, spirited and lovable as I can imagine, and one of the pleasures of "I Wish" is simply spending time with them.__Transforms the commonplace into the extraordinary.__It's about the wonders of everyday life, and of childhood imagination.__The sort of small film of real consequence that, as a kid, I remember seeing and completely losing myself in: That was my life.__A wistful heartbreaker from the Japanese master of quiet observation, Hirokazu Kore-eda.__It's an adult movie about children that feels made from the inside out.__"I Wish" is a wonderful adventure film that's no less thrilling for its modest scale, and a film whose emotional power and intelligence sneak up on you.__There is a lot of hope in the air in "I Wish," but the film never feels sappy.__Whenever its children are on screen, lighted up with joy or dimmed by hard adult truths, the film burns bright.__This wise and funny film, in Japanese with English subtitles, works small miracles in depicting the pivotal moment when kids turn from the wishfulness of childhood into shaping the world for themselves.__More often than not Kore-eda's technique creates space for something truly special in a film: kids talking like kids.__How does Hirokazu Kore-eda do it? His films are so casually infused with graceful realism, they make other movies feel painfully stilted and false.__Full of life, heart, and funny little details about daily existence, as it meanders its way toward moments of real profundity.__I Wish makes us feel like we are watching these kids discover each new sensory pleasure of youth for the first time, or that we're experiencing it ourselves.__With almost supernaturally effortless grace, Kore-eda has connected the film's every element, each one pregnant with beauty and meaning...
Penn has created a colorful tour guide, but in "This Must Be the Place," there's no there there.__Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino handles the story with surprising thoughtfulness.__The cast ... is outstanding, dragging the offbeat story through the occasional look-at-me distractions.__Although "This Must Be the Place" holds our attention, it's a little difficult to say where it's headed.__If you give Penn (and the movie) a chance, the character works, movingly and somewhat miraculously.__The movie replaces emotional precision and intellectual honesty with syrupy sincerity and insistence.__In the end, "This Must Be the Place" isn't just bad. It's inappropriate.__With its overbearing eccentricity, rib-nudging irony and confusion of tones, everything in the film is either underdeveloped or overstated.__This isn't a great movie, but it is a special one.__This Must Be the Place gives Penn a chance to vamp and camp in ways that are sometimes touching and mostly annoying.__Sean Penn as an ex-rock-star Nazi hunter feels like a lot to swallow. It is.__Sean Penn has received a mantle's worth of humanitarian awards over the years. But he might have to give one of them back, just to make amends for "This Must Be the Place."__If the movie doesn't entirely get past its hard-to-buy premise, director Paolo Sorrentino does have the courage of his convictions, not just embracing every contradiction but spinning many of the story's contrivances into moments of strange, aching beauty.__The plot turns are playful as well as jolting, and the visual shocks are gentle: a bison on the porch, the world's largest pistachio, Mr. Penn in his makeup.__Bizarre can be good when it's done deftly. In this case, however, it's done ponderously and sententiously.__This mashup of genres and themes doesn't entirely succeed, but it is warm, funny and ably crafted.__Penn is astonishing, creating a funny, guileless waif, infusing a faded celebrity figure with tactility and humor.__The film's numerous idiosyncrasies-virtues at the outset-ultimately suffocate it.__This Must Be the Place is dazzling to behold.__You're left with the feeling that Sorrentino's eccentric story and daring style masks just another movie about the healing powers of the road.
A stoner comedy with a slightly musty vintage aroma.__High School sucks harder than it blows.__If it ever opens at a theater near you, remember: Just say no.__I'm betting director John Stalberg Jr. also debated calling it "Bake Sale," revolving as it does around the mass-dosing of the student body with pot brownies.__The only good news for everyone involved: The worst moment in your career is surely behind you.__It's a bit crude, a lot illogical and you might have to be in a certain state of mind to enjoy a film this silly.__Surely this could be a fine premise for an entertaining stoner flick. It isn't.__Once the plot has sprung into action, "High School" is a bumpy ride that takes a few amusing dives but never coheres into anything special.__Somehow, High, directed by newcomer John Stalberg, lured serious talent, including Adrien Brody, Colin Hanks and Michael Chiklis. Even odder: They're the worst actors of the bunch.__Lacking real kick, "High School" winds up as irksome as a bag of ditch weed and as lame as the pun of the film's title.__Brody's performance won't earn him a Oscar to place next to the one he earned for The Pianist nine years ago, but it's the only thing that makes High School marginally worth catching.__A silly stoner comedy boosted by a few unexpected tweaks, John Stalberg's debut is more notable for its enthusiasm than its originality.__It's exactly what it appears to be: a funny-enough stoner comedy with a likable cast.__Can audiences who've seen the Harold & Kumar films and watched Method Man and Redman smoke John Quincy Adams' bones in How High settle for so little?__"High School" is a pun. Get it? This is one of those stoner comedies that may be funny if you're high - but if not, not.__There's a certain relentlessness to the film's stoned vibe that gets under your skin, but it's far from enough to make up for the project's dreary mirthlessness.__Spurts of loony inspiration aside -- Chiklis rivals Animal House's Dean Wormer for pure hissable self-righteousness -- this is mostly all reefer, no madness.__A sophomoric comedy with honor-roll style and smarts.__None__None
Characters traipse around city streets singing 60s-style pop tunes in this ungainly, overconceived musical.__Honore's a genuinely gifted eccentric of a filmmaker, but on the evidence of "Beloved," he could use a nap.__The plot of "Beloved," I'm afraid, may try your patience.__Somehow manages to feel sprawling and epic, while at the same time presenting an intimately observed view of two women's love lives.__Skips around the decades, taking a minimalist approach to history - mostly by demonstrating how recent traumatic events have inconvenienced the love lives of its central characters.__It's a film full of turbulence and passion, as a mother and daughter embark on their separate journeys - their pasts and futures, their happiness and sorrow, intertwined.__Lung cancer, coronary thrombosis and French pop music: Two of these things will kill you, but the third will make you wish you were dead.__"Beloved" has a big spirit and, somewhere along the line, it becomes a big film.__"Beloved" is both broody and bright, steeped in amour in all its Gallic permutations - mad, destined, unrequited, sustaining.__"Beloved" is at once whimsical and heartfelt, alive to the absurdity and perversity of amorous behavior and also to the gravity and intensity of human emotions.__This stylish film is enormous fun, whirling and warbling across four decades of amour.__Beloved is a tenderly sincere musical that celebrates love even as it acknowledges the ways in which it can sometimes lead to tragedy.__"Your charm is quickly fading," quips one character to another. You'd think she was speaking to someone behind the camera.__A sprawling mess of multiple romantic triangles in which all the angles are obtuse.__Honore's heartbreaking, gloriously directed and performed musical suggests that this most hipsterish and Parisian of French filmmakers is best when he sets his stories to song.__The early scenes with Sagnier have real verve, and Honore handles his first few shifts in time well, but ennui sets in with yet another chapter bringing songs of decreasing quality and events of increasing tiresomeness.__The carefree love life of a 1960s French mother is daringly juxtaposed with the amorous travails of her daughter several decades later in Beloved.__None__None__None
At times, Warriors sacrifices dramatic nuance for scale, but even its most rousing passages are tempered by a sense of loss.__You can see why Woo, the noted Hong Kong action director, would want to produce it: It fits right in with his "heroic bloodshed" cinematic legacy.__As the war drags on, "Warriors of the Rainbow" outstays its welcome. I've never seen more severed heads in a film and cared less.__An ambitious, blood-soaked retelling of an uprising by Taiwanese natives against Japanese occupiers.__At 2 1/2 hours, "Warriors" is a bruising, relentless experience, one more tiring than inspiring.__At two and a half hours, Warriors Of The Rainbow has the shape of something weightier than the simplified good-vs.-evil movie it actually is.__The film's alternating talky torpor and frantic mayhem makes Warriors feel like it's operating in either fast-forward or slow motion...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
You don't have to give a hoot about basketball to enjoy this movie. This is a movie about identifying with, admiring and responding to achievement in any form.__It is a dream fulfilled.__Here's a twist on the plucky underdog sports movie. The Other Dream Team adds rock 'n' roll and eastern European history to the rah-rah mix.__In an era when so much of the focus in sports is on the glam and the glitz, it's nice to be reminded that it can still be about heart and soul, too.__If you root for documentaries with heart, "The Other Dream Team" is a slam dunk.__Adding detailed historical context, the quirky feel-good story becomes a tragedy and a lesson. And that makes the victories resonate even more.__Clearly, there's a story here. The documentary "The Other Dream Team" tells it in a smart, lively, if somewhat hectic fashion.__An inspirational if overly talkative new documentary that lives at the intersection of nationalism and sport.__The movie sticks to the basic facts and patronizes viewers with plentiful music cues and other emotional pointers; you'd be better off learning this story from an old issue of Sports Illustrated.__Markevicius tells this incredible yarn through the significantly less exciting format of an ESPN-style doc, which gets the job done with minimal flourish.__The title may be less than creative and the bare-bones plot synopsis hardly feels compelling, yet the documentary offers a fascinating and heartfelt examination of history through the microcosm of one sport.__The presentation is conventional in style but uplifting in spirit, and worth seeing even if you know nothing about basketball.__A sports film to remember.__The production's focus is split-properly and effectively-between basketball and realpolitik.__Augmented by a trove of archival footage reaching back to the 1930s, Jesse Feldman's buoyant cinematography merges political history and sports mania into a triumphant timeline.__I fully expect The Other Dream Team to join Do You Believe in Miracles? and Undefeated in your inspirational-sports-doc rotation.__Draws on archival footage and firsthand accounts from both players and outside observers to reveal the complex interaction of politics and athletics that colored the Euro-on-Euro competition.__An uplifting docu from longtime producer and first-time director Marius Markevicius about the nation's unique love affair with basketball.__Triumph on the basketball court catalyzes national identity for Lithuania in this historical/magical masterwork.__None
What started as a long, elaborate joke becomes a journey, both for Gandhi's students and for the filmmaker himself.__Your view of the film may hinge on whether you can accept the ethics of his fakery.__There's a Morgan Spurlock narcissism to "Kumare." It could just as well have been called "Super-Spiritualize Me."__As "Kumare" plays out, both Gandhi and the film become something else, something much more thoughtful and moving.__It's a fascinating social experiment, but not much of a movie.__When I first heard this film described, I assumed it would be a satirical, snarky comedy like Sacha Baron Cohen's "Borat." Not so.__A sort of kinder, gentler "Borat."__If this sounds like reality TV, it basically is. It is also an extremely mean trick. What redeems "Kumare" and its director is that Gandhi knows that.__Almost a 21st-century illustration of the principles described in William James' "Varieties of Religious Experience."__Skims over the vast topic of religion-divorced spirituality, particularly as attached to yoga, with a calculated superficiality...__[A] dubious Borat-esque documentary.__[An] ambiguous exploration of religion, teaching and spiritual leadership.__Prepare to have your assumptions pitched out the window by this tense, surprisingly probing satirical documentary...__Predictably, the doc got a rousing reception at hipster-laden SXSW; real people might find it a touch easy.__None__None__None__None__None__None
It can't be long before we see the Hollywood version.__David France has made an absorbing film to document that moment of immense implosion, called How to Survive a Plague.__As this stirring, scrupulous doc reveals, the members of ACT UP fused the fervor of revolutionaries, the tenacity of trial lawyers, and the rage of the dispossessed to change the very shape of the epidemic.__From a terrible epidemic comes a beautiful documentary.__A raw history, often cluttered and sometimes repetitive but, when strategies fail along with immune systems, deeply affecting.__Presents a valuable template for how grassroots activism can temper societal prejudice and challenge governmental indifference in the face of a mysterious and remorseless killer.__A serious, moving and sometimes astonishingly well-organized documentary about the history of AIDS activism.__[A] powerful, messy and tremendously moving documentary ...__"How to Survive a Plague" captures a saddening, maddening era that seems like far too many lifetimes ago.__It can feel inchoate, dropping the viewer in the middle of events without much context, and it exacts an emotional toll. But its raw quality also makes it compelling viewing.__Plague isn't the history of a disease so much as the history of a movement, and a portrait of those who refused to suffer passively.__Moving and essential.__France and his crew have sculpted years of old broadcast-news stories and home videos into a narrative that is impressionistic in its scope but coherent in its feeling.__One of the most important documentaries in years or decades ...__Mostly the film toggles between two emotions - the high of watching brave people go to war, and the low of seeing so many of them fall, as entire communities are destroyed.__France, drawing on a wealth of video footage from inside the organization, turns that decade of rage, despair, and tenacity into an inspiring tale of effective political action.__A powerful reminder of the ability of committed men and women to agitate, organize and create real change in the world.__A heart-wrenching portrait of one of the saddest, most heroic chapters in American history.__When it's over, this documentary lingers as a testament to extraordinary human bravery. It stands as one of the most heartbreaking and suspenseful sagas of the year.__If the movie expresses equal measures of sadness and outrage, it is charged with the exhilarating excitement felt by soldiers on the front lines of battle.
You have to see The Loneliest Planet, for it is one of those works that prepares you for life, that make you wary, alive and responsible, and which ... well, you'll never forget it.__You hope for these characters, and that hope carries the film.__Though it's not without virtues, "The Loneliest Planet" may try the patience of even the most dedicated lovers of art film.__Why expend more energy on the film than its makers did?__Loktev has written and directed with a haunting emphasis on the shortcomings of some interpersonal communication.__I can't deny that her scheme is dramatically effective, though I left the movie more conscious of the scheme than the drama.__All of this grows tiresome.__The Loneliest Planet is not a perfect work of art, but it gets at something powerful: the way that life can turn us around in a flash, without warning.__Unfortunately, Loktev's dry approach to establishing the couple's relationship means its abrupt collapse causes little emotional impact.__Shot on location by cinematographer Inti Briones, "Planet" is a piece of art even without Bernal and Furstenberg, who are like moving portraits of themselves in this film.__It is gripping and haunting, but also coy and elusive.__Though the film moves as slowly as its hikers, it demands, and deserves, to be watched closely.__The Loneliest Planet does have a quiet power, which is amplified by the movie's rugged landscape.__The film delivers in unexpected ways, and then ponders what it means.__In extending a short story to feature length without embellishing it-at least in the plotting-Loktev suffuses the film with the kind of intimate, microscopic detail and observation that's more common to literature than cinema.__Every scene shift contributes vital information about what it means to guide or be guided over foreign territory, both emotional and physical.__Within a scantily plotted, novella-style narrative (the movie is an adaptation of a short story by Tom Bissell), single shots become story events that mere mention would spoil.__If you are willing to subject yourself to an experience that is outside the norm of what a traditional movie is supposed to do, then you may come away with fertile soil for some fruitful discussion.__Adjust to the deliberate rhythms of this hiking movie-set on the lush slopes of Georgia's Caucasus Mountains-and the psychological payoff stings like a blister.__[A] slow-burning, distinctive second feature from Russian-born, Colorado-raised writer/director Julia Loktev.
True, the film deals with sex. But at heart, it's really about romance.__The movie treats a girl's burgeoning sexuality as neither epic nor problematic, or mutually exclusive of feelings of love, but rather simply, refreshingly, as one part of maturing.__Teenage boys aren't alone in exploring their confused and unruly libidos. Girls go there, too. And when they do, it's no small thing.__"Turn Me On, Dammit!" is a rarity: a comedy about a teenage girl's budding sexuality, treated with wit and kindness.__A wry if saucily subversive charmer, based on a novel by Olaug Nilssen.__For a genre dominated by American movies in which girls are usually prizes or objects of lust, Turn Me On, Dammit! practically feels revolutionary.__Turn Me On, Dammit! is that rare thing: an honest coming-of-age story from the female perspective.__Here's a clever, refreshingly real twist on the teenage sex farce.__[It] never lags, from the first shocking scene to a sweetly amusing John Hughes-inspired finale.__"Turn Me On, Dammit!" is a movie as odd as its title, just as straightforward and considerably more endearing.__It may be a slight comedy but Turn Me On, Dammit! is enormously entertaining.__I can't think of another movie whose finale uses a reference to genitalia to warm your heart.__You'll be gladder to have seen this beguiling little film if you can find it.__Jacobsen's clever, compassionate treatment of Alma's romantic predicament involving Artur, her exhibitionist crush, comes from a perspective you virtually never see in American films.__[It] has a gentle oddness as unforced as its performances and as inoffensive as its dialogue.__Jacobsen's frank, funny but nonexploitative approach to teen libido has the feel of honest memoir, a look back at those years that recognizes,with the benefit of distance, that there's plenty of humor to be found in even the most arduous of growing pains.__The ladies deserve equal time, and they finally get some [Ahem] in this charmingly blunt Norwegian teen sex comedy.__Like its title, Turn Me On, Dammit! is a jokey pseudo-provocation.__A minor, feather-light film, but a vivid and often funny one.__Despite the movie's subject, the director, Jannicke Systad Jacobsen, avoids exploitation. She uses sweet, deadpan humor to take the sting out of the sexual frankness.
It's about a terminally ill man who decides that if he is going to die, he is going to grab a gun and take a whole bunch of obnoxious people with him.__This is no simple wish-fulfillment revenge fantasy. It's an indictment of us as viewers and tacit supporters of the cultural trash heap.__The film features elaborate (and spot-on) parodies of mean-girl reality shows, YouTube nonsense and fatuous news reports but the people are thin and the plot meanders a bit.__This funny, sick twist of social satire is certainly locked and loaded, even if its aim is sometimes off.__The real problem is there's just not enough plot on which to hang the message that mean people suck.__In this "Falling Down" of pop-cultural observation, Goldthwait forgets the thrill of the chase; he's more concerned with piercing verbal barbs than actual suspense.__Mr. Goldthwait's screenplay is essentially a comedy act fleshed out with a story he doesn't try to make convincing.__This movie's idea of topical satire is to score points off of My Super Sweet 16 and legendary American Idol reject William Hung. Timely!__Bobcat Goldthwait's bracing new black comedy...__Goldthwait's ranting dialogue is stingingly funny and Murray and Barr are so agreeable you may find yourself rooting for "the bad guys."__Given that the movie starts out in such interesting fashion, it's hugely disappointing to see it devolve so lazily into a generic vigilante fantasy.__Interesting, sometimes kind of fun but, ultimately, not as satisfying as it might have been.__"God Bless America" has a whole lotta "Taxi Driver" in it, and some "Network," and some "Heathers" (with Barr functioning as Christian Slater in the equation), and even some "Kick-Ass."__Goldthwait's primary strength as a writer-director has been in starting with outrageous, high-concept hooks that develop into subtler, more perceptive studies of human nature.__Here is a film that begins with merciless comic savagery and descends into merely merciless savagery. But wow, what an opening.__Bobcat Goldthwait's new movie is a burlesque that turns into a harangue that turns into a rampage.__[It] turns in on its own morality like a Mobius strip, endorsing kindness by practicing slaughter, and pulls us along for the ride.__When the monotonous squib-popping subsides, the movie is often static and talky, lapsing into criticism-hedging qualifications and anti-everything speechifying.__...isn't as smart as it would like to think it is.__The movie is the kind of undercooked satire that might be mistaken for meaningful by the midnight-madness crowd; let's hope Goldthwait the stealth smartie returns posthaste.
"Bel Ami" is a handsome production, yet riddled with weaknesses.__The supposedly cunning protagonist registers as a cipher, and the directors' tendency to shoot dialogue scenes in close-up blunts any understanding of the social milieu he's trying to conquer.__The women are all elegant and intelligent, they know the ways of the world, and they know Georges' history. Why do they find him attractive? We don't, and that failure is the downfall of the film.__Pattinson's passion is bloodless, his rakish George Duroy a font of undelivered potential.__Good actors flit in and out of the movie - particularly Kristin Scott Thomas and Colm Meaney - but no one seems able to conquer the essential silliness of it all...__What distinguishes Pattinson in the role is the sense he conveys of someone roiling and churning beneath a surface that is almost, but not quite, calm.__Cramming over 400 pages into a little over 100 minutes not only skips over important incidents - like Georges' embarrassed return home with one love -- but rushes the characters through emotional arcs.__With that cast, we rightfully expect fireworks. What we get is the film equivalent of a wet blanket.__Pattinson's callowness and tendency to play rage as petulance don't help.__Pattinson's performance is so enervated that his Georges Duroy comes across as something of a cipher.__An enjoyably soapy 19th-century costume drama with a crackling, female-centric cast that features Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci and Kristin Scott Thomas.__Intriguing political aspects of the story involving military designs on Morocco and the influence of the media would have more resonance if the human drama had more heft.__Although this is potentially juicy stuff, it is as dry and tasteless as a shrunken piece of fruit left in the refrigerator far too long.__Te casting of an inexpressive pinup boy in the lead role is the most up-to-date thing about Bel Ami. Everything else is as conventional as the plodding, pudding-thick score.__The results aren't ribald or provocative or particularly exciting in any way; it's just a slog that will appeal mainly to enthusiasts of 19th-century undergarments.__Robert Pattinson isn't all that bad in "Bel Ami." He just isn't right.__It's based on Guy de Maupassant's 1885 novel, but an old-school must-see-TV sitcom has more depth.__It's the total lack of empathy these characters elicit (or don't) that is Bel Ami's overarching problem.__Pattinson portrays a man who has no moral code and gets to have tons of sex, with various women of smart Parisian society, played by the likes of Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci and Kristen Scott Thomas. Yet mysteriously, the tedium continues.__Though gorgeous to look at, the first feature from Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod has an undeniable void at its very center: an utterly blank leading man.
It's refreshing to watch a music doc, especially one with such intimate access to its subject, in which barely anyone is unreservedly polite about the person in question.__Ginger Baker has been revealed as a major talent, an innovator and an unlikely survivor. And a not very nice guy.__Ginger Baker is, and was, a train wreck. Yet this film, like Baker's onstage playing, is always riveting, and something you can't look away from.__"Beware of Mr. Baker" is comprehensive, if somewhat overly glowing.__The takeaway: great musician, deficient family man, taxing friend and bandmate, excellent documentary subject.__This is warts and all, with the emphasis on the warts.__"Beware of Mr. Baker" argues that when an artist consistently delivers amazement, broken beaks and busted relationships are a fair price to pay.__Bulger tries, unconvincingly, to paint Baker as a difficult but admirable rebel. The lingering question in the documentary is whether his musical accomplishments were worth the trail of damage.__It gives Baker his musical props while at the same time demonstrating the film's title is no exaggeration.__Any movie that starts with the subject assaulting the director (Baker smacks plucky first-timer Jay Bulger squarely in the face with his cane) is already ahead of the game.__If Clapton was God, guess who was the devil?__Miserable individuals do tend to make for interesting subject matter, and this would be far more of a dry biography without its willfully eccentric lead.__The life story of a man who's led one hell of a fascinating life.__The movie salutes the rhythms and the wreckage.__In spite of Bulger's errors of tone, the movie stands as an engaging tussle with the question of what is permissible with the excuse of art.__You'll love the idea that someone like this deserves a movie, but with the whole of heavy metal in his debt, the honor is merited and handled with honesty.__Mr. Bulger ... does not let "Behind the Music" sensationalism overwhelm the music itself, which is Mr. Baker's great passion and the only reason anyone should take an interest in him.__When a documentary begins with its subject using his crutch to deliver a vicious blow to the director's nose, it's reasonably safe to expect less-than-smooth sailing ahead.__Colorful, loud doc digs into the peculiar life of one of rock's most bombastic drummers.__None
"The Woman in the Fifth" leaves so many holes unfilled that instead of ending up intriguing, it's just plain frustrating.__Those who prefer tidy, "Murder, She Wrote" closure are advised to shop elsewhere.__A thankless lead vehicle for Ethan Hawke who's left largely stranded by writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski's opaque adaptation of Douglas Kennedy's novel.__The movie casts such a seductive air of mystery that the resolution feels anticlimactic, yet there's plenty to enjoy along the way, particularly Hawke's nuanced lead performance as a quiet man with secrets of his own.__When do we first sense reality slip away? Do we? Can the film be accepted on its own terms? Can the point of view be trusted?__It is guaranteed to haunt you for awhile.__The Woman in the Fifth is an interesting chameleon until it runs out of disguises, and all that was transitory just looks transparent.__Pawel Pawlikowski's great-looking but pretentious adaptation of a Douglas Kennedy novel.__It's a curio, ripe with dreamy atmospherics and intriguing mysteries, but little else.__[It's] watchable and enjoyable, but it's fairly impenetrable, and it gets more peculiar as it goes along.__Although Mr. Pawlikowski often shows Mr. Hawke in medium and long shots, the actor draws you close.__We are never sure if what we are seeing is actually happening, including the nature scenes that Pawlikowski interjects as contrast to the urban jungle - and also as a symbol of man's animal nature.__I wouldn't have minded a little more time with these characters, before they faded away into the gray Paris sidewalks.__This pensive, seductive drama is full of devious strategies, which begin with its protagonist's name: T. Ricks. Tricks.__The Woman in the Fifth fairly oozes enigma; if only it could drum up something to be enigmatic about.__Pawlikowski can't decide what to do with his protagonist, whose writer's block is the least of his emotional burdens.__Fifth feels like a literary bauble, chipped by imperfections.__[Pawlikowski] creates a nice sense of paranoia and multicultural bewilderment that's the welcome tonal opposite of Woody Allen's romanticized Midnight in Paris fripperies.__You realize you've been watching an object that's all surface, no soul.__You're not sure what this is till it's over, but certainly Hawke's performance is his nerviest and most sincere in a decade.
An action-packed look at the men who do their best to keep Detroit from going up in flames.__These stories are moving, but what really distinguishes the film is the sense of an entire city giving in to self-immolation.__An emotional character study of a group of heroic, yet very human, individuals.__The film makes you thankful for members of this macho breed, who relish risking their lives to save others.__Burn captures the danger (and, yes, excitement) of putting out blazes, as well as the futility of dousing flames in a city rife with arson-and the struggles to maintain adequate funding in a wrecked economy that hits the public sector hardest.__Vividly captures a year in the life of eastside Detroit's Engine Company 50.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
You may prefer spending your money on the book.__A straightforward documentary that uses Yoni's own words - in the form of his moving, eloquent letters and poems - to create a searing portrait of his short but meaningful life.__[It] serves up its material with an excess of treacly music and an overabundance of glowing reminiscences. This has the odd effect of making his story less powerful than it actually is.__Never explains why, exactly, Israel embraced this dead soldier so tightly.__Doesn't give much more than a cursory sense of what Yonathan Netanyahu was like as a person.__It is pure hagiography.__This was a man who needed no help standing out from the crowd.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
It would be ripe territory for self-reflection if this sloppy debut from filmmaker Anne Renton weren't plagued with as much self-doubt and uncertainty as its lead Catholic.__At the most fundamental level, as a work of entertainment, it fails. Scenes meander pointlessly, beginning and ending without any change or story movement.__A moving story of a woman's attempt to keep pace in a world that's moving too quickly for her.__A leaden, ham-fisted affair that was exactly the sort of pap John Waters was spoofing when he cast Turner as a serial-killing soccer mom.__The film's gentle, sentimental approach prevents it from ever really getting at the pain that's been swirling around this imperfect family for years.__"The Perfect Family'' is Kathleen Turner's show. And when a series of crises forces Eileen to re-examine her values and beliefs, Turner rises magnificently to the occasion.__The film's single saving grace is Turner, who channels that legendary Catholic guilt like there is no tomorrow.__[Turner's] performance is the deepest and truest element in this shallow feel-good movie about the clash between gay rights and Catholic orthodoxy in a generic suburban town...__We need more of Turner onscreen, so I hesitate to criticize when she finally appears. But the truth is that she's sadly underutilized in Renton's debut.__Turner's interactions with Deschanel are so much weightier than the rest of the film that the other storylines seem extraneous.__In the final scene I found myself laughing and crying at the same time.__Turner seems stifled by the joyless role of a woman whose only purpose is to be taught the error of her sanctimonious ways.__Renton's competing tones and intentions result in a film at odds with itself and its lead performance.__Hardly perfect, but definitely trying to be good.__Turner's complex and heart-wrenching performance provides a window into the life of a woman dedicated to the values and commitments her church dictates, even during her family's darkest times.__A dynamite Kathleen Turner desperately strives to be named "Catholic Woman of the Year" in tyro helmer Anne Renton's feel-good religious laffer The Perfect Family.__It's hard not to wish that it had taken a few more chances and explored its certainly relevant themes a little more deeply.__None__None__None
This is how the conflict looks from the other side of the barrier.__A tough watch that'll leave you despairing of peace anytime soon.__As raw as the material of "5 Broken Cameras" can be, it is also lyrical and elegiac.__[A] bit jagged, inevitably incomplete, and in no way news-breaking: it is simply moving.__Takes the rough material of one man's life and transforms it into a story that is universal and urgent, offering firsthand witness to events that are too often portrayed as distant and impossible to understand.__Both a moving first-person essay and an artful exercise in political advocacy, 5 Broken Cameras is about the experience of West Bank protests from the inside.__[It] makes no pretense at balance - it's unambiguously pro-Palestinian - but it offers a unique and intimate record.__Israeli filmmaker Guy Davidi helps shape all of the footage into a compelling and very personal documentary, helping to craft the eloquent commentary in Burnat's voice that knits it all together.__What we do see has an immediacy and intimacy that's involving. It also can feel a bit wayward and cumulatively wearying.__The issues are complex and not easily solved. But no matter which side you are on, you'll be moved by this intimate work.____It offers a look at how a tireless protest can sometimes only come at the expense of one's own daily existence.__"5 Broken Cameras" provides a grim reminder - just in case you needed one - of the bitter intractability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.__Startlingly intimate and direct, this first-person doc by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi requires multiple viewings for anyone eager to work out how it could have been shot with such precision and visual ingenuity under such plainly chaotic conditions.__Troublesome, worthy.__Unlike the more sophisticated chronicle of resistance Burma VJ, it pays scant attention to the larger political context or, indeed, the strategies and tactics of protest in an age that offers sophisticated means of media management.__Doc finds an affecting personal angle on West Bank territorial dispute.__None__None__None
"Hello I Must Be Going" is at once an intriguing character study and a refreshingly offbeat romance.__The movie's sharp-tongued and softhearted, a Sundance kind of film that mostly sidesteps generic Sundanceyness.__Sarah Koskoff's screenplay is flagrantly duplicitous, introducing the heroine as a self-pitying sloth, then trying to pass her off as likable by making nearly all the other characters drips, snobs, or unfeeling scolds.__Succeeds almost entirely on the strength of Melanie Lynskey's heartfelt and humorous performance in the lead role.__Sarah Koskoff's play-it-safe script and Louiso's heavy-handed direction combine to kill the potential of "Hello I Must Be Going."__Lynskey lets us see, from deep within Amy's fog, an instinctual desire to please, and a sense of innocent wonderment at how she could possibly have gotten into such a mess.__Much credit goes here to Christopher Abbott, whose persuasive performance bridges the gap. He's like a living embodiment of the cliche, "I love you enough for the both of us."__A funny, well-written, involving and emotionally honest tale.__While there are laughs and plenty of them sprinkled throughout, Hello I Must Be Going is predictably sweet and ends up exactly where you think it might, safe and sound.__I hope Hello, I Must Be Going will introduce many new viewers to Lynskey's charms, and that at least of a few of them will be casting directors.__This isn't a new topic for independent films - ten years ago, Jake Gyllenhaal was the busy boy-toy in both "Lovely & Amazing" and "The Good Girl" - but this film handles it with fresh eyes, and a gentle approach.__Abbott has a compelling unpredictability, though, and in a couple of his scenes with Lynskey, you can spot the stirrings of a more complex film than the one we finally ended up with.__Overall, the comedy is a lovely showcase for Lynskey and the rest of the cast.__But while this is Lynskey's show, the real gut-punch comes from Danner as the uptight and dissatisfied Ruth, who loves her daughter but also wants her to get her life together (and, ideally, the hell out of the house).__Lynskey inhabits the role so completely, brings such exquisite naturalness to her performance, that she becomes someone we root for unreservedly.__[It's] better than the story it has to tell, and that is thanks to the bravery and sensitivity of Ms. Lynskey's performance and the sweet, intense love affair that is the film's main concern.__Both funnier and deeper than you might expect at the outset.__... not just one of the finest indie releases of the year, but one of the sharpest and most moving and engaging movies of the year, period.__Every scene - including mopey family meals, secret assignations, and confessions under the stars - breathes with a freshness that carries this tiny romance safely beyond the realm of indie cuteness, into the world of a character worth caring about.__Koskoff's script is all stock epiphanies about getting your life in order and following your dreams.
A wicked Midwest satire with razor blades stashed beneath its bright candy-apple surface.__Hardly the high-priced spread, this condescending comedy about Middle America will score with some audiences and put off others.__Plays like one long, slow descent into cloying moralizing and uplift that's well past its expiration date.__The movie's entire superior attitude is kind of annoying.__We're still just scratching the surface of witty, provocative humor as long as envelope-pushing directors such as Jim Field Smith continue to find work.__At times, the Midwestern satire "Butter" is almost funny, and in its honor I almost laughed.__Director Jim Field Smith keeps the quirky characters coming with smooth efficiency and throws in some nice touches along the way.__At 90 minutes it feels inflated, and though clearly intended as funny, it's difficult to locate, except in the most general terms, the focus of the movie's satire, and there's not a laugh to be had.__Given the talent assembled for this diversion, you can't believe it's not better.__The film grows increasingly mirthful as the characters come into focus, and the casting is the key: Ms. Garner, who also helped produce the film, has a gift for catty roles ...__Butter thrives on skewering characters whose self-importance isolates them completely from the consequences of their actions.__This film is dumb, blunt-instrument parody.__Drippy sentiment and coarse political satire vie for control of "Butter," a two-faced sendup of heartland obsession that wants to have its toast and eat it too.__Butter is a film more enamored of its premise than interested in making it work.__"Butter" is funny in spots, but it's so preoccupied with landing below-the-belt cultural jabs that it misses the opportunity for laying out biting social commentary.__Butter wishes it were a Christopher Guest sendup but comes off like a cheap imitation.__A shrill, cartoonish mess - not a total disaster, but no one's idea of a good movie.__It's one thing to create biting social satire; it's quite another to shoot at such easy targets.__Butter is laid on too thick, and in other places it's spread too thin, and it never quite develops a flavor of its own.__A toothless, insufferably smug satire using competitive butter-carving as a weak-tea stand-in for Midwestern politics ...
If this were real life and not a movie, Mr. Wildhorn would be written off as a crank and ostracized within a week.__It's earnest, predictable and disposable.__You can quarrel with the smiley-face outcome of every ordeal, but the tenderness and optimism are so powerful and ingratiating that only a viewer with the darkest sensibility will go away untouched.__Shamelessly schmaltzy and predictable from first moment to last, Rob Reiner's The Magic of Belle Isle nonetheless manages to conjure a certain spell.__Madsen, a strong actress who might have matched Freeman, is portrayed in varying shades of blandness. Even Freeman, good as his is, is held back here.__So resolutely inoffensive that it flirts with Hallmark Hall of Fame territory.__That Freeman would be willing to settle for this, perhaps, isn't that surprising; he hasn't been interesting in breaking a sweat for awhile now. But is this really the best that director Rob Reiner can manage?__"The Magic of Belle Isle'' smothers two of this year's best performances - by Morgan Freeman and Virginia Madsen - in enough family-friendly sweetness to induce diabetic shock.__The magic of this new movie's title emanates from the beautiful, measured performances of its stars.__It has some heartfelt performances and a nice, nondescript vibe, but it's largely unmemorable.__For a movie that spends so much time extolling the virtues of the imagination to show so little of its own is more than ironic -- it's offensive.__A pastel-colored, embroidered wall-hanging of a drama directed by Rob Reiner.__It's predictably ironic that The Magic of Belle Isle champions the unparalleled power of imagination while displaying absolutely none of its own.__Shaggily sentimental and a few spells short of enchantment.__None__None__None__None__None__None
The beauty is in the array of animated faces in Anders' life. And it's in the simple promise and vitality of Anders' face, which serves the film without any regard for being in a film, let alone a tragedy or a poetic vision of darkness and futility.__With a predilection for long takes, alternating between tripod setups and handheld camera work that's reflective of Anders' unease, Trier presents life as an unceasingly tepid stream of the mundane -- with an occasional, exquisite pinprick of hope.__The movie transpires mostly in quiet, engrossing dialogue scenes, and its austere style shares a good deal in common with the protagonist, who seems both opaque and completely exposed.__[Displays] an invigoratingly acute understanding of the psychology of insecurity, longing, defensiveness and inward-turning rage.__"Oslo, August 31st" is quietly, profoundly, one of the most observant and sympathetic films I've seen.__A coolly observed yet boundlessly compassionate day in the life of a recovering drug addict, "Oslo, August 31st" breaks your heart many times over.__Trier proves that he's no one-hit wonder.__The result is a superb exploration of loss, guilt and regret in Norwegian director Joachim Trier's often-unpredictable second film.__It has absolute clarity about a character who isn't at all sure about what he wants - or whether he wants to keep going at all.__[Screenwriters] Trier and Vogt are neat and cunning.__Pared down and sparse, almost Bressonian in its formal rigor...__A study of a man who pulled away from the edge of the abyss at the nick of time, only to realize he may not be able to forgive himself for the things he's done.__Te movie seems more like a searing portrait of self-discovery and realization, with the understanding that not everything you learn about yourself will be pleasant.__Trier ... keeps us aware of the emotions and perceptions of all the characters, even at those times when their perceptions are limited and differ from objective reality.__With his angular features and intense gaze, Lie is utterly convincing as an intellectual in the process of repairing his damaged life.__"Oslo" is an example of strong, confident filmmaking in which nothing is miscalculated or out of place.____Despite its themes, "Oslo, August 31st" is an exhilarating film, with impeccable direction and pitch-perfect performances that make the bleakness worthwhile.__"Oslo, August 31st" has the satisfying gravity of specific experience, and also, true to its title, a prickly sense of place.__It's a marvelously constructed personal journey, both wrenching and bittersweet, whose emotional ripple effects stay with you for days and weeks afterward.
Arnold drastically pares back dialogue and exposition, telling the classic tale of passion and revenge with probing, harshly sensual camera work and a minimum of sentimentality.__In reality it's a bit of a slog.__Arnold has been successful in reimagining the story's archetypal emotions in the story, bringing it closer to its passionate elements.__Arnold ... has put her stamp on Emily Bronte's 19th-century novel Wuthering Heights, but it's a smudged and imperfect stamp, to be sure.__Essentially a misunderstanding of (or an inability to convey) the breathing soul of this material.__Lyrical and minimalist - if you don't care for such qualities, you may just find it slow ...__You feel its damp chill, enveloping the characters like a rough, thick cloak; if you screamed into this wind, nobody would hear you.__Arnold is so much stronger on atmosphere than event that she comes to seem resentful of Bronte's plot, and the final scenes are less discomfiting than laughable.__With so much attention paid to mood and imagery, emotions seem to get lost in the wind.__It's just that there isn't enough story - the book shouldn't be required reading for the film to make sense.__All of the book's poetry is gone; it isn't even a memory.__Arnold, a director of uncommon originality, attacks our very notion of what a costume drama should look like. The result is neither dainty nor remotely refined: It's an animalistic, mud-splattered howl of torment.__If you can slow down your movie metabolism enough to acclimate to its world, Arnold's naturalistic retelling grasps an elemental truth about the novel.__This is what the movies can do.__If you can handle the glacial pacing and lack of dialogue, there is a certain squirmy satisfaction to watching this well-worn story of love, cruelty and madness play out minus the long-winded speeches and romantic catharsis.__This impressionistic take includes some strikingly authentic visuals, but the acting is lackluster and the languorous story often sinks into tedium with its focus on the minutiae of country life.__I love this movie, and love the way it burrows through an English-lit classic to deliver a sensory, kinetic experience that's true to the book but also entirely different.__An admirable, frustrating attempt to strip away the novel's inherited "classic" status and restore its raw and earthy passion.__...a film that is always interesting but never entirely compelling.__It's an unexpected take on Wuthering Heights, one made all the more powerful, and no less faithful, for its unconventional choices.
The mostly played-out found footage aesthetic has its limitations, and V/H/S doesn't escape all of them. But the collected directors do manage to make many of those limitations into the films' strengths.__I came, I saw, I hunkered.__"V/H/S" probably sounded great in the pitch meeting, but it loses all luster through some shoddy execution.__Two hours of nausea-inducing shaky cam footage that fails to tell a coherent or engrossing central story.__The film also plays to the strengths of the found-footage format, proving that sometimes the scariest things are the ones you can barely see.__Hardcore horror lovers will soak up the gruesome morsels.__"V/H/S" puts the majority of today's mainstream "scary" movies to shame; perhaps the solution is to cut them all down to about 15 minutes, and fund them on a shoestring.__At nearly two hours, the gimmick punctures a hole in itself, causing ambience bleed-out.__A low-budget horror anthology with segments both ghastly and moronic ...__[A] too-long, violent horror anthology ...__No one should be expected to endure 115 minutes of this nonsense.__This anthology of "found footage" horror featurettes is predictably hit-and-miss.__"The Blair Witch Project" meets mumblecore.__This indie compilation has enough inventive chills to interest any horror fan.__This horror anthology collects six shorts of varying quality, all purported to be found footage. My favorite is Ti West's Second Honeymoon.__All told, V/H/S brings some cohesion to the Wild West of indie horror filmmaking, and seems destined to become a key artifact of a DIY era.__What's the point? None of the segments is particularly compelling. Strung together, it's way too much of a muchness.__An ingenious hybrid: part Godardian art film, part abstract video experiment, part sleazy shocker, and all self-castigating interrogation of what film-theory types call the "male gaze."__Mainly, the omnibus film feels undercooked, even on the grounds of its forced technological setup.__In too many of the shorts, bad acting quickly undermines the "authenticity" the aesthetics labor to achieve.
The film's generic, meaningless title is a sign of the dullness to come.__360 is a classic example of how you can't always judge a movie by its credits.__Though the cinematography looks sleek, with shots through windows and in mirrors, split screens and city lights that blur and sharpen, the stories equate to a tangled mess.__Much like its own characters, it dithers too much - and it dares too little.__'360' is classy but utterly amorphous, and that seemingly benign title gives far too much away.__Like the fork that usually comes with your airplane meal, 360 is plastic.__One thing is remarkable here: the amount of high-powered talent assembled to document the obvious.__"360" gives us much in the way of international anguish, frustrated coupling and longing stares, but there's very little plausibility or genuine emotion in its egregiously contrived story of ardor gone amiss.__360 throws in enough cold weather, meaningful stares and cursory explorations of globalism to fool easily-impressed audiences into thinking they've seen something important, but there's nothing new or resonant going on here.__With its international collection of mostly two-dimensional characters and its barely developed ideas on adultery, capitalism, addiction and sex, "360" is an over-plotted and dreary farrago.__Mr. Morgan has written some good movies, notably "The Queen," and Mr. Meirelles has won fans for neo-exploitation titles like "City of God." There's no way to know what went wrong with "360" and whether it was this uninvolving and shallow from the start.__The movie makes for joyless viewing, big stars and all.__A mistake from beginning to end.__360 has the pedigree, cast, and scope of a weighty film, but nothing much to say.__360 has a circular structure that's deftly pleasing, though the human drama is just facile enough to make it seem, in the end, a little too much like connect the dots played with people.__I hope Peter Morgan doesn't give up writing, and I do hope Meirelles gives up trying to be Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.__We hopscotch from person to person, continent to continent, grievance to grievance until things come thuddingly full circle (thus, the title).__Any lingering goodwill is sapped in the final minutes when a character earnestly opines, "We have come full circle." Talk about a cycle that needs breaking.__There are fleeting moments, but Morgan's narrative promiscuity leaves 360 feeling only spread out and empty.__A better title: A Few Famous and Not-So-Famous Actors Bump into Each Other and Don't Do or Say Much of Consequence. Wordy, yes, but accurate.
Baker effectively juxtaposes two vastly different worlds, though he never makes the case that either is as significant as the gauzy visuals suggest.__This is confident, engrossing storytelling, and the actors are terrific.__Starlet sneaks up on you.__Where it counts, "Starlet" ... allows its characters room to maneuver within the potential cliches.__The film itself deserves praise for its portraits of these two women and the different worlds they inhabit.__The plotline is unpromising - young porn actress befriends crotchety old lady - and the setup is underwhelming. But stick with "Starlet," and you'll reap unexpected rewards.__The film is about as indie as indie movies get, with a homemade, washed-out look that drives home the genuineness of the performances.__This slender film is bolstered by strong performances, particularly from Hemingway (daughter of Mariel) and her 85-year-old co-star.__A strikingly unsentimental study in female friendship between unmoored souls in L.A.'s bleached, glamour-challenged San Fernando Valley.__"Starlet" is like a flower growing out of a septic tank.__As its title suggests, "Starlet" is a Hollywood story, albeit one that Hollywood would not be likely to produce.__You may have never heard of Sean Baker, but he's one of the most astute and least sentimental chroniclers of life on the fringes working in film today.__[An] ethereal slice of life in the San Fernando Valley ...__A thrillingly, unexpectedly good American movie about love and a moral awakening ...__It's a character study about faith in connectedness, with an unforced love for cross-generational companionship that's special indeed.__Starlet represents a welcome throwback to the smoggy West Coast character studies of the 1970s - and not just because the generational chasm between its two leads evokes Harold and Maude.__Starlet is refreshingly unsentimental in its depiction of both youth and age.__An empathic, absorbing tale of the old and the beautiful, Starlet tracks an unlikely intergenerational friendship in the San Fernando Valley.__Unfortunately, the film signals its more serious aspirations aggressively, via "thoughtful" synth drones and an italicized parental subtext.__Powerful sense of place roots film about the uneasy friendship between a 21 year old and an octogenarian.
"She's never not performing," says one friend. And the documentary, "Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present," confirms it.__Briskly edited and brightly shot.__In place of evenhandedness, the film gives us a full sense of a personality and intelligence so riveting that we begin to comprehend why all those hundreds of thousands lined up at the MoMA.__Abramovic is raw and likeable, if mostly inscrutable.__The film's centerpiece is the retrospective devoted to Abramovic at the Museum of Modern Art in the spring of 2010.__The film goes a long way to establish the intellectual seriousness and dedication involved in her ambitious series of art stunts.__The second half offers shot after shot of the people who sat opposite Abramovi - an unexpectedly enthralling record of reactions that range from stark agony to rather phony amusement.__So magnetic is she that if Abramovic had chosen to be a baker, or a janitor, you could still make a film about her and it would be only slightly less bombastic, and no less stirring.__A portrait of an artist whose life and work intertwine in ways even more compelling than might be imagined.__When director Matthew Akers is able to make Abramovic's titular 2010 MoMA exhibition - featuring anonymous, silent, face-to-face sit-downs - undeniably moving, something is obviously working.__The Artist Is Present does at least seem to capture moments where Abramovic seems genuine...__We're given an intimate seat to this wildly democratic - and creepily messianic - spectacle.__Rare is the profile that captures so much oddness with so little judgment. You owe yourself a chance to be challenged.__She's trying to access a shared humanity, to foster an unusual intimacy with viewers-to strip herself, often literally, to a naked and undeniable truth.__Ms. Abramovic is an eloquent and passionate explicator of her art and the experiences that informed it.__Challenging art is made accessible in doc about performance-art sensation Marina Abramovi&#263;.__An intelligent overview that makes a radical artist's work comprehensible to audiences with no previous awareness of her or her chosen path.__None__None__None
Has taken almost two years to reach the UK; you'd be forgiven for thinking it was far longer, given its sub-Joseph Losey pretensions and doily-like styling.__Sometimes a feast of acting isn't enough.__A brilliantly acted semi-dud.__Too often the film's moods switch unsuccessfully between the abruptly serious and the broadly bizarre.__Rush and Davis are two of the best actors in the business, and their brittle gamesmanship and rue holds the screen. But the film is disappointingly lackluster -- a mild squall instead of a storm.__It all feels like a whittled-down miniseries.__The project's ambitions turn out to be greater than its ability to achieve them.__[A] dramatically unsteady, blustery if likable film, which was adapted by Judy Morris from the Patrick White novel.__Schepisi orchestrates these vitriolic cat-and-mouse games with great subtlety and skill, and you can almost feel the pleasure he takes in watching these actors do what they do best.__The title takes on a depressing literalness; you sense the movie teetering with tonal imbalance, its brilliant cast of savage line-readers forced to turn inward.__Its portrait of the grotesque uber-privileged has considerable bite, bracingly reveling in the greed, selfishness, bitterness, jealousy, neurosis, detachment, and hunger for power and sex ...__Sometimes a film just can't live up to all its reputations.__The subject matter is dark but disjointed, despite the best efforts of the cast.__Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis bookend a cast consisting of some of Oz's finest thesps, but Schepisi never gets a grip on a script with awkward literary tics.__An intelligent, visually sumptuous drama that embraces the grandeur of the Australian literary classic upon which it's based.__None__None__None__None__None
Hardcore horror heads may scorn its snail pace and shaggy-dog sweetness, but for discerning viewers, 'The Innkeepers' is a slow-burning charmer.__We can't dissociate ourselves from the evil because, as in much of the best horror, what's scaring us isn't external; it's everything we fear seeing when we look in the mirror.__Fans of the horror genre can expect to get all nostalgic about the 1970s feel to the action, which most certainly includes people going down the basement, all alone, in the dark, and that sort of thing.__West freshens up the horror genre with a distinctive, careful camera style and an ability to write with empathy and humor.__The Innkeepers makes such youthful passivity seem nearly as treacherous as opening the cellar door.__This film has some of the usual scary cues and tense moments, but the setting, the old Yankee Pedlar inn, emerges as a more interesting character than any of the people.__The place offers West plenty of odd, creaky spaces to inspect as the innkeepers' project of capturing ghostly events on video (a joking reference to the Paranormal Activity franchise) begins to bear fruit.__A nice change-up. Not much gore, but some good scares.__"The Innkeepers" may have some of the retro charm of a boardwalk spookshow. But the ride is too long - and too few of the attractions seem to be up and running.__It's just too bad, innit, that The Innkeepers isn't much of a keeper.__So entertaining are the characters that you may leave the theater before realizing that the film's specters might emanate from somewhere much closer -- much, much closer -- than the haunted history of a Connecticut hotel.__There's a skillful appreciation here for the kind of subjective dislocation behind the best ghost stories, and in this era of bloody-disgusting, that kind of smart ambiguity is welcome indeed.__"The Innkeepers" is no masterpiece, but you may well leave with your nerves expertly jangled.__Up until near the end ... you could mistake it for a low-key haunted-house comedy.__Smart, funny and creepy, The Innkeepers does a great deal for Ti West's reputation as an up-and-coming filmmaker while simultaneously making rustic hotels seem a lot less quaint and charming.__Luke and Claire are guilty, above all, of being dumb and bored. Even their interest in the ghost that may dwell in the dark corners of the Pedlar seems tepid and lacking in conviction.__For too long, this movie asks us to be interested in something that rarely in the history of the service industry has been sustainably entertaining: how dull certain jobs can be.__There's a lot to be said for horror that doesn't hit you over the head with shock and gore and special effects. But if you're going to go that route, you need to have more than The Innkeepers delivers.__The trappings may look familiar, but "The Innkeepers" is a new twist on the good, old-fashioned ghost story: It's the bored-slacker horror movie.__A well-shot but generically dull disappointment.
This film is unique in a dreadful way: what happens on screen would not be particularly interesting without the facts surrounding its making.__Not a conventional film, certainly, but a powerful and important statement.__There is courage and cheekiness here. What there is not is a story, or much insight or even anger; anyone expecting an indictment of Iran will be sorely disappointed.__Truly and defiantly extraordinary in its own quiet way.__This may not be a film, but it's a moving statement of defiance and despair.__It's a cry from the heart of an artist compelled to create, tell stories and respond to hostile, confounding realities.__In short, "This Is Not a Film" is the world within an apartment, and it is quietly devastating.__The more "This Is Not a Film" underscores the cruel containment of a great artist, the more we actually become aware - very indirectly, in a very Panahi fashion - of a city in chaos outside, with sounds of gunfire and distant street blazes.__It's a statement about courage, a poke in the eye of political oppression.__I would like to show "This Is Not a Film" to those in the United States who are in favor of a close union of church and state.__An act of political defiance, a moving personal document and a meditation on what film is and can be.__As for Panahi, I could watch him for hours. With his film, its title, with his dignity and strength of purpose he mocks the stupidity of the regime's censorship.__There are fireworks -- and an ending that's as dramatic as anything made by any director making a film, which is something Panahi accomplishes with a bit of a wink, and no small amount of courage.__The triumph of This Is Not a Film is not only an artistic one -- the very existence of this movie is a gift. No wonder it came to us in a cake.__Fascinating for what it signifies as much as what it shows, "This Is Not a Film" illustrates how Panahi is struggling to stay alive creatively and, paradoxically, can't help but demonstrate how much of a natural filmmaker he is.__Against all odds, an unquenchable artist has made yet another piece of powerful art.__It's irrefutably art, and undeniably vital.__Any way you slice it, it's a brave and brilliant act of defiance.__The film is terrific ... at capturing the drip-drip-drip of what amounts to, basically, Panahi's home imprisonment.__Rene Magritte, whose famous pipe painting is slyly honored in the movie's title, would be jazzed.
The Island President is an important portrait of a determined man standing fast in a place where the ground is literally shifting beneath his feet.__Climate-change documentaries are almost always disturbing, but "The Island President" communicates a special urgency.__[An] engaging, gorgeously photographed documentary.__Nasheed is indeed inspirational, a cool-headed but passionate and courageous guy. You end up wishing a lot more leaders were like this guy.__Shenk expertly weaves Nasheed's extraordinary personal story together with the Maldives' breathtaking natural beauty and a Capra-esque tale of dogged idealism and political courage to create wonderfully vivid cinematic portraiture.__What makes Nasheed's whirligig tactics so urgent is that, unlike most other countries participating in the summit, his own nation is actually in danger of being annihilated by climate change.__"The Island President"is heartening and unsettling by turns.__"The Island President" is a mostly compelling documentary about that rarest of breeds, an appealing politician.__"The Island President" personalizes the threat of global warming, and nationalizes it too, by focusing on Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives.__What's fascinating and frustrating about The Island President is how it reveals international politics to be even more polarized and mired in bureaucracy than local politics.__Viewers get an eye-opening look at behind-the-scenes wrangling.__A portrait of defiant optimism as a last-chance means of survival, Jon Shenk's The Island President offers not only a Mandela-like tale of political heroism but a much-needed perspective on climate change.__The hope that infuses this movie makes it all the more upsetting to walk out of the theater and contemplate a looming disaster that the world's leaders seem unable to prevent.__It's fascinating to be so close to a then-sitting head of state as he negotiates for his homeland's survival, and the news that Nasheed was recently deposed in a coup by Gayoom loyalists makes the hard-won victories he did secure all the more poignant.__Moves swiftly from political scene-setting to follow Nasheed's every move as he prepares to make an impassioned environmental plea at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit.__Shenk's film is close enough to his subject to catch the leader who rails against carbon-dioxide emissions puffing on cigarettes in parking lots.__None__None__None__None
Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai reveals yet another facet of this always-unpredictable filmmaker: a flair for compassionate, humane melodrama.__A quiet, narratively layered period drama with a focus squarely on character.__Miike can't seem to get enough of Hanshiro's heroics. That's not just visual excess, though.__A 3-D epic that, despite its title, is more of a soap opera than a swordplay thriller.__It's an indelible picture of a cold-hearted ruling class that has allowed self-interest and hypocrisy to override its own humanity.__Miike brings a formal, elegant restraint to his usual flair for wild theatrics.__More moving than shocking, it proceeds slowly and gracefully, and the few scenes of bloodshed are emotionally intense rather than showily sensational.__With this sober, mournful, gorgeously mounted and marvelously acted drama, Miike connects himself to the greatest traditions of Japanese film and to the period of historical self-examination that followed the debacle of World War II.__Ryuichi Sakamoto's score, Nobuyasu Kita's cinematography and the performances are all impressive.__The Miike of old resurfaces for the climactic sequence, but Hara-Kiri seems intent on proving that his instinct to shock runs secondary to a more consistent instinct to rebel.__Miike turns the format's inherent limitations, especially the tendency toward visual murkiness, to his advantage, fully immersing us in a world suffused with moral and ethical rot.__It may well be Miike's best film, a patient, ominous piece of epic storytelling that conscientiously rips the scabs off the honorable samurai mythology.__It doesn't help that Miike shot Hara-Kiri in 3-D, which as usual accomplishes nothing save for making the action look as if it's taking place during a partial eclipse of the sun.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A loud, grating wallow in dime-store despair.__The film is guilty of reverse sentimentality, where the relentless unhappiness comes to seem as manufactured and artificial as the schmaltz in a romcom.__Detachment gets an A for enthusiasm but a C for execution.__There's something weirdly effective about the artistic desperation, which includes inserts of chalkboard animation and to-the-camera testimonials.__Everywhere you turn in Detachment, someone is trying to make you feel like hell.__Detachment gets to you. It hits hard.__It wants to be an expose of the pervasive horrors of modern life. Instead, it just forces us to detach as well.__"Detachment" quickly gets stuck in its own world-weariness.__Even at its most ludicrous - when it is shouting into your ear - its sheer audacity grabs your attention.__[Brody] is undermined by a bloated script (from Carl Lund, a former public-school teacher) that lumbers him with bloviating asides about how we have failed our children.__It's nice to see righteous anger in a movie. If only the education drama "Detachment" knew what to do with it.__Kaye frequently flirts with familiar tropes, but here, he takes them in a loving embrace, betraying a rank sentimentality the film otherwise avoids.__Brody, as the semi-fallen idealist, has a haggard eloquence, and Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Hendricks, and James Caan, as his colleagues, act out a bitterly funny spectrum of desolation.__The movie is one big scream, cliched and hardly credible as an oblique call to civility.__Adrien Brody, one of the weirdest looking actors of the millennium, plays Henry Barthes, a man so emotionally blocked by a lifetime of disillusion that he cannot connect with any other human being.__The movie's motives might be admirable, but its execution is so bogged down in impenetrable old-white-guy self-pity that the real problems facing public education and its practitioners get buried in the wallow.__The movie works, and, though it cries out against so much, you sense that the one thing it does not cry is wolf.__Brody is brilliant, but can't save the Book of Job proceedings from tilting over into the ludicrous.__Despite many nameable flaws, [it] is a wrenching and powerful achievement...__Harrowing depiction of the American educational system features a superb performance by Adrien Brody.
I can hardly wait to see which closet Dick will throw open next.__A must-see expose of the abuse of power in an institution that is supposed to serve and protect.__I have rarely been more righteously riled up than I was while watching the documentary The Invisible War.__Interview after interview, statistic after statistic, Dick's advocacy project thoroughly incenses -- and appears to be having results.__This travesty has been encouraged by a military culture that blames the victim and a policy directing soldiers to refer complaints to their commanding officer, which typically results in no action or even reprisals against those speaking out.__One of those documentaries that you watch both fascinated and repulsed - and one of those films that you sense just might be instrumental in helping to change an utterly unacceptable status quo.__"The Invisible War" makes all too clear that the military isn't very good at justice.__One hearing noted that the victim was dressed provocatively. In her official uniform.__For sheer infuriation value, you can't do much better than Kirby Dick's quietly scathing documentary on rape in the US military.__Dick, whose films include a revealing expose about the movie industry's film ratings board, has created yet another galvanizing call to action with "The Invisible War."__What happened to these women after the rape often shocks and disturbs them as much as the physical act itself.__It is far too difficult to watch. Which means we must.__This is not a movie that can be ignored.__The movie depicts the military's culture of intimidation and assault as global, not as an aberration that might be explained by the pressures of combat or the tedium of life on secluded posts.__Every adult who owes a debt of gratitude to American soldiers should see Kirby Dick's heartbreaking documentary about sexual violence in the military.__There's a sense that Dick would rather be effective than fair, but The Invisible War wants to tear down walls, and sometimes a sledgehammer comes in handy.__The intense interviews and damning statistics (20 percent of all female personnel have experienced sexual assault) do the work of whipping up outrage.__Dick's films often strut with a lilting impudence, but his new work is dead-serious, as suits the subject.__Any attempt to look at deeper-rooted causes behind these assaults is completely AWOL.__The Invisible War, though revelatory, is perhaps the most straightforward film yet from a director who likes to broach the fault lines of sex and society.
Given its aggressiveness in all cinematic matters, My Way manages to color in the personal stakes with enough clarity to keep you caring about the players set loose on its massive canvas.__They should have spent more on the screenplay.__Adolescent boys will savour My Way's bombast and solemnity. Cringing adult audiences will more likely beat a retreat before final call.__"My Way," billed as the most expensive Korean film in history ($25 million) is epic, packed with action - and it's lousy.__An eye-popping, empty-headed World War II epic made in South Korea.__The bloody chaos can be suitably overwhelming, but you're too aware of the whizzing camerawork, helter-skelter editing and bombastic score.__"My Way" is combative to a thematic and stylistic extreme.__The paeans about national pride and brotherhood may be regional, but constant slow-motion battle scenes and squishy sentimentality are strictly wanna-be Tinseltown.__Marshals an overbearing score, turbulent handheld camerawork, and a punishingly brief average shot duration toward the story of two archnemesis long-distance runners who form an unlikely alliance amid the welter of world war.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Gets disappointingly literal with what proves to be a goofy psychological story.__This is ... an intelligent, scary little movie. Because it's smart enough to know what's really scary is what's inside us.__"Intruders'' looks great and has a promising opening, but this atmospheric Spanish psychological thriller is otherwise pretty underwhelming.__Why do so many horror movies that begin with promise fall apart in the final act?__If you don't guess the big twist in the first 30 minutes, "Intruders" is half of a good movie. If you do, it's about a third of a good movie.__It's a pleasure to find that Mr. Fresnadillo has assumed the mantle of horror classicist to make "Intruders," using shadows and directorial sleights of hand to coax forth its slow-building scares rather than just pouring on the usual guts and gore.__Little happens in the first act, and most of what transpires in the second will be contradicted by the events of the third. Doesn't leave much of a net sum.__Its muddled, overambitious story leaves us unsatisfied - you might even say hollow.__Owen is a good actor stuck in a subpar creepfest that makes no good use of his gravitas and talents.__"Intruders" promises much but delivers relatively little.__Plays with classic horror elements of rain, bony monster fingers, vertiginous camera angles, and assorted shout-outs to Pan's Labyrinth.__Intruders is never scary, and it's so implausible and uninvolving that even when it's being explained, it is still unconvincing. Talky psychology is a poor substitute for supernatural thrills.__All Hollow Face -- a black-hooded, vaporous shape -- likes to do, apparently, is hover over sleeping bodies and snatch a leg or two.__With nothing tangible at stake, Intruders is just an aggregation of influences that's as blank as its bogeyman.__As these parallel supernatural mysteries begin to meld into one another, all semblance of credibility dissolves, leaving behind an impenetrable and frustrating fog of unanswered questions.__Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's technical skills are impressive, but this psychological chiller loses traction in the over-explanatory concluding stretch.__[This] attempt to marry a monster movie with high-toned themes of storytelling and memory yields something more generic than it sounds.__None__None__None
Like all over-ambitious B-movies, this features solid performances by a mix of seasoned talent and promising young actors, all of whom deserve better.__Despite a super-dark noir plot and respectable cast, "Deadfall" is a thriller that never quite delivers on its promise.__Perhaps the best thing about "Deadfall" is the lifelike messiness of its ending. A couple of the characters have a lot of explaining to do, and this is one case where a sequel might be in order.__It's sort of like "Fargo," only with a higher body count and without the wood chipper.__Deadfall is fast and fatalistic ...__This is the sort of movie best encountered accidentally and for free, caught on basic cable late at night.__There's nothing you haven't seen before - and better - in "Deadfall," which would seem to appeal mostly to fans of snowmobile chases.__Dean and Ruzowitzky want both inexorably tightening plot and keen psychology here, and they can't always have it both ways.__A genre characterized by often grisly violence, high style and a distinctly nihilistic outlook.__At times it is riveting stuff and at times ridiculous.__[An] atmospheric, suspenseful, snowbound crime thriller with a creepy, sexy undertow ...__"Deadfall" brings to mind those dark, old-fashioned entertainments in rotation on Turner Classic Movies that suck you in with their genre machinery, sullen beauties and despair.__Watching this violent potboiler is like observing a thief knock off a convenience store, then seeing him lock his keys in the car.__An A-list cast fights a B-movie script and goes down hard in "Deadfall," a wintry suspense melodrama that's not quite awful enough to be any fun.__For Ruzowitzky, Deadfall seems nothing more than work for hire.__[It has] enough plot contrivances and twisted, twinned destinies for any old movie, though not necessarily a good one.__Looks great but sacrifices much in its charge towards a final showdown that's been telegraphed from the early going.__'Deadfall' deftly transforms the climactic moments ... therapeutic for some, devastating for others. It's a beautiful thing.__Bana and Wilde sport bad Southern accents and deliver overly mannered dialogue while dropping hints about their abusive childhood.__A complete nightmare of a movie.
"The Details" is not just entertaining, but potentially useful.__As the title suggests, it's all in the details, which writer-director Estes provides in large if not always convincing doses.__It's hard to make a fine actress like Laura Linney look off-key and shrill, but "The Details" manages to do just that. It's hardly an accomplishment.__"The Details" cancels itself out by being too campy to take seriously and too tragic to laugh at.__"The Details" wears its quirky heart on its sleeve, signaling (and smirking at) its own silliness, at every opportunity, with an intrusively antic score that makes everything sound like a giant joke.__It all adds up to create a dicey morality tale that's as improbable as it is strangely believable.__Instead of turning soft and squishy, this examination of karma gets tougher as it goes along. Its refusal to settle into a cozy niche may be commercially disastrous, but I take it as a sign of integrity.__In exploring how easily and strangely the life Jeff and Nealy have built together unravels, The Details lays out a series of mundane and dangerous objects as signposts - provocative keys to the film's darkly comedic and tense puzzle.__The movie is many things, but a mess isn't one of them. Estes knows exactly what he wants.

This period action comedy by Jiang Wen is great fun in the Shakespearean tradition, stuffed with lively characters, dramatic stand-offs, and stolen-identity subplots.__After watching it, I was as confused -- and giddy -- as if I had been rolled down a hill in a rain barrel. For unmitigated insanity, this is a hard film to beat.__Jiang directs with great vigor, serving up plenty of blood and a lot of laughs as he turns his picture into a propulsive blast.__See it now, uncut and in widescreen, before it disappears - and then reappears, years later, referenced in some Quentin Tarantino picture.__Along with the familiar East-meets-West elements derived from Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone, Jiang offers cleverly choreographed action scenes and fun-house mirror complications.__Word is that Jiang went though 30 drafts of the script before he was satisfied. Perhaps he should have gone for 31.__Not exactly a western, barely an action film and hardly a historical drama, the Chinese saga "Let the Bullets Fly" promises genre pleasures it routinely leaves un-triggered in its chamber.__At least 30 minutes and several scams too long, the plot passes from amusing to confounding long before the final double-cross.__"Let the Bullets Fly" has a clearly defined moral dimension, but Mr. Jiang, an absurdist at heart, never lets it interfere with the fun.__A ribald mess of a farce whose finer qualities will likely be lost on non-Chinese-speaking audiences and others not familiar with 1920s warlord lore.__Though a good-natured and highly enjoyable goof, Jiang Wen's comic blockbuster - the highest-grossing movie made in China - more than lives up to its name.__Chow and Jiang having an especially great, crackling chemistry based off surface agreeableness, hidden aggression, and below that, an almost-fond recognition that they're all just crooks.__Don't even try to keep up with the labyrinthine plot and triple-layered identity confusion.__Comedy and shifting-allegiances intrigue more than compensate for the dearth of rousing action in this 1920s-set film...__A rollicking, violent, Western-cum-comedy that serves many masters, but adds up to an entertaining hot pot of wry political commentary and general mischief.__A rollicking Chinese western directed with cinematic gumption.__None__None__None__None
__Passably pleasant but thoroughly predictable.__A movie whose main virtue was its honesty ultimately lands in a place that feels canned and unsatisfying.

True to its title, "Declaration of War" is a visceral, forthright visit to the front lines of battle, where superhuman courage is called for as life-or-death skirmishes turn into a long slog of survival.__The tonal shifts, the "Amelie"-style voiceover and the punk-retro soundtrack may jar some viewers who expect uninterrupted violins, but "Declaration of War" is alternative therapy that really works.__The subject matter is as serious as can be, yet the style is vibrant, energetic and engaging -- often tense, but without a trace of woe-is-me.__"Declaration of War" movingly chronicles a unique and terrible fight: that of two parents against the cancer that has invaded the brain of their 18-month-old son.__As ponderous and overwrought as a film hogged by a couple of young hipsters named Romeo and Juliette can be.__The film may even be too upbeat, especially the ending, which is too easy and contrived.

And it's very much worth seeing.__A vibrant and heartfelt French film that captures the mood and the memories of young parents who found themselves in the trenches fighting for the life of their child.__"Declaration of War" has it all: comedy, romance, fantasy, musical interludes and a child with a brain tumor. Wait - what?__"Declaration of War" still is a profoundly affecting family drama, no matter how much artifice Donzelli piles on top of it.__Sick children and their struggling parents rarely make for a lively film. But "Declaration of War" does just that in an unusual French mashup of stylized techniques and stinging blows of emotion.__For all its quirks and tangents, "Declaration of War" feels entirely alive. This story of two people who transform fear into action is inspiring.__What's so wonderful about the film's flights of fancy is that they in no way diminish the emotional stakes of the piece, but they do keep the story from slogging down into gloominess.__Though it's certainly moving, it suffers from a frantically overproduced desperation to hold what the filmmakers seem to fear will be our wavering attention.__What is surprising is how the film appreciates the way people unready for a huge responsibility can step up to the challenge, and find out who they really are in the process.__Sprinting through hospital rooms, parties, sterile corridors, and grayish courtyards, Declaration Of War salutes its characters' capacity to step up and meet life's harshest unexpected demands.__An unexpectedly upbeat autobiographical drama made with French New Wave pizzazz about a young boy with brain cancer and the parents who pull together to fight for him.__I admit I admire the writing and acting of the two brave stars, who declare war on film in which there is only one enemy to fight -- their child's deadly disease.__Donzelli has, against all odds, crafted a genuinely moving ode to both the tenacity of filial love under extreme circumstances and the toll it extracts.__Declaration of War turns autobiography into thrilling expressionist art.
True to its title, this energetic Hong Kong comedy trades primarily in off-color gags, yet its tone, like that of John Waters's films, is so playful and inclusive that it's unlikely to offend anyone.__"Vulgaria" is certainly crude, but most of its amusing vulgarity is discreetly held off screen.__A broad, cartoonish -- and decidedly filthy -- satire of moviemaking is as sophomoric as they come.__The film boasts the spontaneity of a French New Wave romp, while including raunchy gags worthy of The Hangover and Clerks II.__The film's kinky energy eventually wanes, the pileup of profanities losing its initial zing.__Either the golden height of human imaginative endeavor or as profane and crazy as a meth-addicted stripper.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

There's much to admire about Panos Cosmatos' directorial debut, but the end result is admittedly not for all tastes.__The movie looks like it was lit by lava lamps, scored on Moog synthesizers, written between bong hits and acted underwater. None of this is meant as praise.__"Beyond the Black Rainbow" has a doomy, dreamy, druggy, draggy feel that's impressively sustained - until it becomes oppressive, then pointless, then laughable.__Much of the time, watching Beyond the Black Rainbow is accompanied by head scratching, but perhaps that's the point of this trippy outing.__Close-ups of a needle penetrating gnarled toes and a mutant slathered in what I choose to believe is bittersweet chocolate make as much sense as the scary drawings of angry vulvas hiding in a drawer.__This would-be cult classic is the movie equivalent of gazing at a lava lamp for nearly two hours.__Add two more stars here if zoning out to weirdo-dreamy, '80s public-access TV with a synthesizer soundtrack is your idea of midnight fun.__Beyond The Black Rainbow is more surface than substance, but those surfaces are gleamingly polished enough to make for a hypnotic experiment that goes beyond genre pastiche or art-school wankery to seem formally daring.__A welcome attempt to bring back the days of El Topo and Eraserhead, when night owls embraced directors who wanted to screw with viewers' heads, not just the ones who screwed up their chances for auteristic posterity.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This great poem on the end of the world is truly a film for the ages.

It's not about event and emotion, but duration and endurance.__It feels like the creation story in reverse -- a terrible, unavoidable walk into the dark.__Through Tarr's meticulous vision, these ordinary hardships take on cosmic weight; this is tedium vividly rendered.__An intentionally monotonous look at the lives of a farmer and his daughter.

In the evolutionary spectrum of cinema, "Natural Selection" is like the duck-billed platypus, pretending to be warm-blooded but more than a little fowl.__[Harris is] the one good thing in "Natural Selection."__However gritty this indie comedy may look (cinematographer Steve Calitri seems to be aping William Eggleston's photographs of the American south), it isn't all that different from an Adam Sandler vehicle.__[Harris is] the big reason that "Natural Selection" is so engaging.__In Harris' hands, Linda is guileless but believable, her smile so worn and wary that it almost hurts to see it.__A coming-of-age portrait of a sweet, innocent, middle-aged Christian woman who bursts through the confines of a sexless marriage.__The loser junkie and the chaste Christian lady make an odd couple, in an odd film, but the oddity gives way to an effortless, persuasive charm.

__In the 98 minutes of "Pink Ribbons, Inc.," a wealth of information and images flit past, many intended to raise eyebrows if not ire.__You have to agree with the advocates who charge that some corporations are milking cancer.__"Pink Ribbons, Inc." is a colorful indictment of corporate infestation, but it's missing a prescription.__At the very least ... this documentary will make you question the status quo.__The film raises the question of whether branding the disease has taken precedence over preventing it.__It's a well-argued polemic that, despite being one-sided, has loads of useful information to share, if only to begin a crucial argument about health care, allocation and coordination of research dollars, consumerism and the privatization of philanthropy.__Activist Judy Brady sums up this film's unapologetic message: "When I see a pink ribbon," she says during the end credits, "I see evil."__Blending expert testimony with emotional appeals from a support group for women diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, this stinging indictment raises an all-together different call to arms.__For all the stellar intentions; revelatory evidence; and thoughtful, wall-to-wall interviewees, this frustratingly overstuffed documentary indulges more in spraying buckshot than stalking a target.__The movie's indignation seems justified on at least one point: that the pink-ribbon movement thus far has done more for marketing than for medicine.__It's a crude, angry battering ram of a film, much more concerned with counter-messaging than aesthetics, but it gets the job done.__Above all, Pink Ribbons, Inc. is an argument for reintroducing into the public discourse the uncertainty, fear, and complexity that cancer sufferers and their loved ones know all too well.__It's a powerful and subversive reminder that, pink or not, depoliticizing a worthy cause is never pretty.__Pool's documentary provides some cold clarity on a well-advertised if misunderstood disease.__Even pink ribbons have shades of grey.__None__None__None__None
This dreary independent drama is essentially an art-world soap opera, but without the melodramatic verve that makes some soap operas interesting.__What we have here is a household ripe with seduction, lust, betrayal and repression, all kept below the surface by increasingly strained good manners.__...a self-important nightmare ... shallow script and boring situations. Perhaps that is the simplest way to sum up the film, boring. Offensively boring.__The direction is decent, and the film is handsome. But it's finally frustrating, enigmatic in a way that suggests emptiness more than mystery.__[A] lackluster indie drama ...__You feel the characters' pangs as they spin out of control, and you are reminded of how easy it is for a careless sexual adventurer to destroy relationships and families on a whim, without even fully realizing it.__If you allow yourself to drift with it, rather than get frustrated by all the non sequiturs, "Nobody Walks" becomes a more enjoyable film.__Russo-Young's characters simply feel like complex, confused people trying desperately to be happy without also destroying their lives with their poor impulse control.__The acting ensemble is crucial. Everyone's really fine.__Nobody Walks is a film of acutely observed little moments that unfortunately don't add up to anything of substance. It's a forgettable shrug of a movie, pleasant enough, but unlikely to linger.__Russo-Young studies the strange species of affluent Angelenus erectus under a microscope that distorts every character into unbelievability.__The actors are all completely wasted in this dumb travesty of fumbling, unfocused, oversexed numbskulls who work in the movie business.__Artfully constructed but hollow at its core, "Nobody Walks" makes it impossible to stop watching while simultaneously making it impossible to care about what's happening.__Evocative ...__For a film about sexual conquest, Nobody Walks is a frustratingly flaccid affair.__Has the fragranced whiff of a missed opportunity.__Sensitively written, nicely shot, expertly acted, and intelligently ambiguous, "Nobody Walks" still manages to send you out with a shrug.__The characters, especially Kolt's Italian tutor, demonstrate they have the impulse control of toddlers.__A young woman's arrival creates sexual upheavals in a cool, artistic L.A. household, in an unsatisfying drama that might have worked better as a comedy.__Nobody Walks looks and sounds great.
By the time its third story kicked in, "In Another Country" lost me.__If you take the film as the bauble it is, you'll be entertained by its lighthearted wit, social observations and resolute sidestepping of profundity.__A beguiling set of variations on a theme, a gossamer-light etude composed for delight rather than dissection.__Isabelle Huppert has reached that magical point where she gives a thrill of delight simply by showing up, her decades of great performances seeming to hover around her like a halo.__A movie may be a representation of the world, but it is also something that happens in the world, which means that sustaining a cinematic illusion and breaking it are equally beside the point.__In Another Country sets its characters adrift inside its own narrative sphere, letting them live several lives in the course of an hour and a half, and letting us share in their freedom.__The cumulative impression is of figures being lightly traced in the sand only to be inevitably washed away, intentionally ephemeral and quite charming for it.__It's a fairly banal comment on foreign estrangement (or love) that could have used some roughing up.__Hong Sang-soo's intricate new comedy of broken romance reaches exquisite heights of self-mocking pathos, painterly finesse, and symbolic density.__The presence of Huppert in this one suggests an interest in branching out beyond the cult faithful.__It almost seems as if Hong is poking fun at his own single-minded oeuvre, creating a fractal representation of how his other films obliquely interrelate.__It is - for all its charms, and despite Hong's trademark formal experimentation -- ultimately rather lightweight stuff.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Great premise, middling execution.__A high-concept, high-energy lark.__"Sound of Noise" is a dry treat - a solid, self-aware cult pleasure.__Filmmakers Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjarne Nilsson and their engaging cast pull off the feat with no strain and a surprising amount of heart.__"Sound of Noise" is like no heist movie you've ever seen; these bandits want only to transform a city into a canvas for their special brand of aural art.__The energy flags whenever the vandals are at rest, and a romantic subplot feels like an afterthought.

Tsangari's art-house minimalism, which never lets us forget we're watching a movie, still permits a surprising degree of tender emotion.__Using occasional song-and-dance numbers with a melancholy Godardian kick, [Tsangari] creates a world that's off-center and alive with loneliness.__Part of the film's success comes from Labed's performance as Marina, who infuses all that weirdness with a barely there vulnerability.__"Attenberg" is a three-layered love story, anatomizing the mysterious emotions of grief, friendship and erotic attraction.__The drama, at its core, is simple and conventional, but it has the aura of science fiction.__Tsangari distinguishes herself from her predecessor's freak-show formalism with an underlying humanism and freewheeling playfulness.__A cracked coming-of-age tale set in a fading Greek seaside town.__In that isolation, and in the marooned hopelessness of the protagonists, there is a hint that normal life may have become too much to cope with, and that its rules of engagement need to be learned afresh.__Attenberg remains a captivating and vaguely disturbing experience throughout.__To enjoy 'Attenberg', you have to tune in to an unusual wavelength, but there are strange pleasures to enjoy.__Attenberg is distinguished aesthetically by cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis eye for both the beauty of coastal Greece and the hideousness of its mineral factories, conveying, like the film itself, the life-giving and life-taking moments in our lifetimes.__What a strange, moving, puzzling, funny, frustrating and ultimately absorbing film this is.__The film succeeds not only as an idiosyncratic spin on the coming-of-age story but a wider comment on what it means to be fully human and fully alive in an age of diminished expectations.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

It's a hard movie to dislike.

Still too self-referential, too hermetic and too glacial to offer much enjoyment beyond the gorgeous monochrome visuals.__Patric's performance is a deadpan treat. His can-do, take-charge character is in continual zany contrast to his surreal surroundings.__'Keyhole" is the first Guy Maddin movie that feels as if it got only halfway out of the director's head and onto the screen.__Funny enough to be disarming even when it's spinning its wheels thematically.__A Maddin film has a disturbing way of always seeming to exist in the present, like a dream. You know what happened and you even know what will happen, but you also see it all shifting and changing.__Like Maddin's melancholic and relatively more conventional My Winnipeg, Keyhole is about a memory house, but one that is even more fragmented, mythical and elusive.__Amid the mythical allusions and the climate of decay, "Keyhole" overthinks its exploration of memory and forgiveness.__Count me - and hopefully you - amongst Keyhole's grateful dead.__Yes, sometimes the whole thing comes together like a poem or an early surrealist experiment. But too often, it just seems like a jumble of fantasies and daydreams.__Maddin's new film Keyhole reminds us that his aesthetic owes as much to David Lynch as it does to F.W. Murnau, and not just because Lynch's onetime muse Isabella Rossellini co-stars.__While it has its moments, "Keyhole'' feels like something that might have worked better as a short.__To a die-hard Maddinite this may be a little disappointing, but for that reason "Keyhole" may also be a perfect gateway into the bizarre and fertile world of a unique film artist.__Maddin looks to the past of film the same way he often obsessively examines his own, and the two can't really be separated.__Keyhole contains stretches as potent and distinctive as any in Maddin's filmography, but they stand apart from each other, and fail to fully connect.__It was a dark and stormy night. What? You've heard that one before?

Losing Control nicely mixes comedic absurdity with weightier career vs. commitment themes.__Perhaps investigating something new would have better served Weiss than simply looking to her own experiences, exploring rather than settling.__Weiss's ideas about moviemaking, storytelling, and character development are indistinguishable from bargain-bin romantic comedies (so-called chick flicks) and television shows that barely last a season.__[Kent is] the least credible scientist since Denise Richards donned short shorts to play Dr. Christmas Jones.__While Losing Control is a thoroughly likable, playful comedy, there's never a sense that writer-director Valerie Weiss is in total command of film's tone, pacing or comic content, which is considerable.__Science-themed rom-com isn't ready for clinical trials.__If you want to enjoy watching a confused scientist grappling with life choices, stick with "The Nutty Professor."__Takes a frenzied late turn into espionage territory, an attempt to gather momentum that only makes the film more tiresome.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Isabelle Huppert may be approaching self-parody as an icon of Gallic frigidity, yet the talented writer-director Anne Fontaine puts that to excellent use in this broad, obvious, but consistently funny bedroom farce.__"My Worst Nightmare," though predictable, moves along nicely enough for most of its 99 minutes, thanks to an offbeat chemistry between Huppert (who's very good at looking appalled) and the very relaxed Poelvoorde.__[Huppert] can't get laughs where there are none, and she can't buy a laugh in the movie's second half.__"My Worst Nightmare" isn't great, but it isn't apologizing for anything, either. Plus, I laughed out loud at least three times.__No one loves a broad comedy like the French, but Gallic touches of restraint tend to keep such light entertainment pleasing rather than blundering.__Its tepid satire of art world pretensions culminates with a visual dirty joke that is mildly amusing but still not worth the wait.__Whether this is an argument for or against marriage probably depends on the viewer's own experience.__A trite story of loosening up.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

It flows along placidly, heated only occasionally by a bit of sex or disco dancing.__A melancholy story of romance and regret with moments of drollery and sweetness along the way.__Scenes of breezy intimacy mix well with deadpan comic moments, and Noguera's face is that rare male visage that seems boyishly opaque but over time suggests deep reserves of melancholy.__Bonsai illustrates the unbearable lightness of loneliness in a quiet, delicate manner.__This isn't a story of Shakespearean proportions, but it's a sweet peg for this complex, carefully constructed gem.__In clumsier hands it would be easy to get lost amid the expanding thicket of narrative twists.__Bonsai seems like a veritable thicket of illuminating references and correspondences.

This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movie's kick of confidence.__Director Francis Lawrence's film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly, it leaves you wanting more.__The budget is nearly twice the original, and it shows. Great work from the A-list cast, amazing set designs and costumes.__Now the violence is not merely physical, but existential.

It becomes more conventional in the second half and loses steam, but it's always heading somewhere.__Katniss Everdeen's quandaries and director Francis Lawrence builds suspense through cunning shifts of character in this spiffy second chapter of the trilogy.__It's largely satisfying as far as screen adventures go, and comes fully loaded with special effects and action scenes, and embellished with the usual brand-name character actors ...__This sequel is a triumph of production design: Philip Messina's settings are so detailed that they convey how the movie's dystopic U.S. functions beyond the story at hand, and Trish Summerville's costume design shows a similar degree of invention.__An improvement in almost every way from its pretty decent predecessor.
Iron Man 3 has good things in it, enough to please the series' fans -- and yet too many drawbacks to win many converts.__The trouble is that, as the plot quickens, any cleverness withdraws, to make way for the firecrackers of the climax. That is not Black's forte, and his movie duly slumps into a mess.__Shane Black excels at writing witty, self-referential, pop-infused banter, and there is no actor working today who is better suited to delivering it than Robert Downey Jr.__Iron Man 3 feels like an exploitative mulching of present-day anxieties. The script is ambitious but not wise enough to be rightfully cathartic. It's more Cuisinart than art.__The action, directed by Shane Black, ranges from passable to interminable.__Black is good at giving his heroes a morbid, self-hating edge and even better at coming up with hateable villains.__After a while, the steady diet of tongue-in-cheek starts to taste monotonous as day-old gum.__Just like he does with those crummy Sherlock Holmes movies, Downey elevates this rather flimsy material with his sheer presence.__It would be just a special-effects-and-hardware extravaganza, with a dead-end script full of wrong turns, were it not for Robert Downey Jr. and a game and witty cast.__By even posing questions of identity, the film creates the kind of jeopardy we can believe in, and for a superhero movie, that is an accomplishment in and of itself.__Snappy dialogue, momentarily startling plot twists and lots of stuff blowing up.__From its anxious protagonist and the battered metal sheaths he dons to save the world to the clattering, fiery mayhem that ensues with metronomic predictability, Iron Man 3 is less a movie than a final war whoop let loose before utter exhaustion sets in.__The third iteration of a franchise that began so well becomes a hollow hymn to martial gadgetry. The suits and story clank in unison.__It's a confidently tongue-in-cheek piece of blockbuster engineering, sweetly calibrated to Downey's cavalier appeal and to Kingsley's oddball interjections.__The action plays like a video game because, well, it may as well be.__[Black] strikes a tone of pseudo-edgy frat-boy black comedy that's so retro it's almost charming.__The movie is shrewd enough to skitter along so frenetically that nothing, not even tonal contradiction, can stick.__Downey is in fine comic form, especially when he's sparring with young Simpkins, who thankfully throttles back on the precociousness.__But for all the clanking armies of iron knights on display to dazzle the eager kid in each of us, this summer epic rings hollow. There's no one home inside the suit.__For the second year in a row, Marvel is starting the summer off with a bang. Let the blockbusters begin, and let's see if they can top this.
Disney has another hit in its repertoire with this heartfelt story of sisterly love and one of the few films released in 3-D this year that splendidly incorporates the technology into the plot line.__Frozen reminds you how many animated films rely more on inside jokes. It's modern without being hip, earnest with being sappy.__Extravagant care is taken with minutiae, and the directors, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, whistle through the first twenty minutes of the plot with a controlled giddiness that would leave many live-action adventures staggering in their tracks.__If you thought there was only so much to be done with ice and snow as visual fields, think again along the lines of prismatic crystals, epic storms and fantastical structures built on water's gift for freezing itself into see-through art.__Frozen' has both showtunes and darkness, but most satisfying is a formula-defying finale that successfully subverts the fairytale status quo.__In a year of weak animated features, Frozen - loosely based on "The Snow Queen" - takes the lead by default.__It's hard to generate a sense of warmth when the plot points all feel so coldly calculated, and it doesn't help that the musical numbers are so pedestrian.__Frozen is one of the few recent films to capture that classic Disney spirit.__While the journey may seem overly familiar, the destination has some surprises in store.__Make way for a new kind of fairy tale. These Frozen princesses are the kind we can definitely warm to.__"Frozen" is a winter wonder of a family film, the sort of movie you hope for during the holiday season. Well, it's here, go see it.__Frozen establishes a strong, confident tone: Cool mythology, rich, vivid animation, and 3-D effects that are actually worth seeing, not just migraine-inducing distractions.__For all its professionalism, I found it as cold as the ice rink at Rockefeller Center.__Disney claims this feature-length animation is based on Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, but it feels more like a Hollywood romcom.__Most importantly, this is a long-needed step in the right direction to a more varied depiction of female characters in Disney's canon.__The splashy humor and dazzling set pieces of this erratic animated melange compensate for putting a pallid female Mr. Freeze at the center of a paean to sisterly love.__The story-aside from a climax that plays like a too-knowing rebuke to Disney formula-goes tediously through the motions.__Unlike in many animated movies, the borrowings aren't so much in-jokey as structural. Homages, of a sort, and fun to spot.__Disney gets nearly everything right in this animated charmer: wit, warmth, a lovely voice cast and a real message of girl power.__It's no secret that Disney princess films are formulaic, and the fact that Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee's Frozen is entertaining without being groundbreaking just confirms that the formula works.
This is one of those rarities, an animated sequel that improves on the original.__Co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, who do Minion voices expertly, never let up on the laughs. A fart joke in 3-D may not be three times as wacky, but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun.__How do you tell a story about a bad guy who is no longer a bad guy? Despicable Me 2 embraces the dilemma and adds new ones.__As a sequel [it] stands level with the first film (also directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud), and may have the edge on it.__[A] remarkably tepid sequel to the surprise 2010 hit ...__If you're looking for quality prepackaged, predigested Hollywood family fun this summer, you could do a lot worse than Despicable Me 2.__[Despicable] Me 2, even at its weakest, is still a charmer.__"Despicable Me 2" is light on its feet, visually inventive and very fast with the repartee. It requires actors who can pull off the many peppery lines at warp speed and in that the film is lucky with its voice cast.__Heartfelt and hilarious, smart and silly, action-packed but never violent, "Despicable Me 2" is that rare sequel that outshines its beginnings.__The animation is beguiling, particularly when Lucy drives her car into the ocean, transforming it into a submarine that scoots around sharks and fish.__An animated sequel that, despite not achieving the inspired lunacy of the first movie where Gru literally steals the moon, is smartly calculated to deliver squeals to kids and amusement to accompanying adults.__Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin deserve credit for not rehashing the basic ideas of their first effort, but they never really expand upon its unique universe either.__It's breezy and affable without ever going completely soft.__The scope of the 'toon espionage-adventure goings-on is surprisingly limited. But the filmmakers so clearly love working on these characters, their creative joy is infectious.__Slapstick high jinks are plentiful, though never particularly funny.__Sure, it's not as novel as the first time we were here, but directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud stay true to the clever, slapstick vibe.__"Despicable Me 2" is trying to tickle, not teach. In a marketplace full of toxic messages, that's not such a bad thing.__Better, or at least sweeter, than the first, with Wiig adding some much-needed romantic charm to the toddler-level humor.__[It] is consistently diverting and so cute you'll want to pet it. Yet it is also weightless and lacks a center.__Despicable Me 2 feels like a opportunity to get together with some old friends, hang out, and discover what they've been up to.
Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this film's near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer don't dramatize the analogy, they presume it.__The movie consists of endless declamation, endless violence.__There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story.__There's plenty to like in Snyder's hectic, rowdy film. But by the time we reach the bludgeoning excesses of the last half-hour it's hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity at least partially missed.__Cavill broods handsomely as Superman, but this reboot skimps on fun and romance.__The movie delivers on the promise of its title and then some.__Man of Steel packs quite a wallop. A few too many wallops, as it turns out.__The chief problem here is one of rhythm and balance in the storytelling and directing. The movie swings between destructive overstatement and flat-footed homilies.__It all gets exhaustingly bombastic although, sequence by sequence, Man of Steel is something worth seeing.__The mechanical storytelling swamps a first-rate cast.__For now, audiences can only speculate as to the hidden depths of Cavill, who in Zack Snyder's busy, bombastic creation myth is reduced to little more than a joyless cipher or dazzling physical specimen.__Snyder provides an elegantly illuminated retelling of the origin story of that most saintly of superheroes, Superman.__You get the feeling [Snyder] would rather have chucked the entire back story, not to mention the front story, and just delivered up nonstop bashing. Which he sort of does anyway.__By the end, Man of Steel has mutated into just another superhero action movie, with explosions galore and city buildings toppling like so many Legos. Lather, rinse, repeat. That's too bad because ... Man of Steel has so much going for it.__Man of Steel's violence doesn't escalate; it simply, tediously, iterates. We keep waiting to thrill, to exult, to cheer our hero on. When the lights come up, we're still waiting.__For those who crave cinematic mayhem, Man of Steel is right up your alley (and it will make a ton of money).__Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders.__What seals the movie's doom ... is its surrender to the lower power of coarsegrained action and computer-generated images of inexplicable banality.__Man of Steel is just the same old same old.__"Man of Steel" doesn't do quite as much damage to the 75-year-old hero, but next time out I hope his lighter spirits are allowed to soar.
Believe the hype: Gravity is as jaw-droppingly spectacular as you've heard - magnificent from a technical perspective but also a marvel of controlled acting and precise tone.__Unfolding as a series of terrifying object lessons in Newtonian physics, the movie lends new meaning to the phrase "spatial geometry."__Gravity is not a film of ideas, like Kubrick's techno-mystical 2001, but it's an overwhelming physical experience -- a challenge to the senses that engages every kind of dread.__Nerve-racking, sentimental and thrilling, Gravity honors terra firma even as it reaches for the stars with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.__Cuaron and his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, keep the audience in weightless suspension right along with the astronauts. For most of us, Gravity is the closest we will ever get to the real deal.__Gravity, a weightless ballet and a cold-sweat nightmare, intimates mystery and profundity, with that mixture of beauty and terror that the Romantics called the sublime.__Doctoral theses will be penned on the breath-catchingly realistic, gorgeously choreographed, entirely mesmerizing opening ...__In the end "Gravity" has only the most basic things to say, but it says them so well and presents them so marvelously that it's a cinematic wonder.__Gravity is a celebration of the primal pleasure of movies.__This is one of the most stunning visual treats of the year and one of the most unforgettable thrill rides in recent memory.__It strives to bring cinema's past, especially the rip-roaring, edge-of-the-seat thrillers Hollywood used to make, into its technological, weightless, oxygen-free future.__This enthralling tale of survival in space will open up young audiences' eyes to the excitement of out-of-this-world exploration -- and make older audiences remember the wonder they felt at 2001: A Space Odyssey.__Gravity is the kind of enthralling, all-encompassing, giddy cinematic experience that surfaces once in a blue moon.__The movie isn't perfect. But it provides a perfect moviegoing experience, and that's almost as good. The second time I went I watched a lot of the faces in the audience, and they looked just as I imagine mine did the first night I saw it: Whoa.__It's a rare combination of jaw-dropping special effects and visual artistry, and it also works as slam-bang entertainment with just two actors and a swift running time of 90 minutes.__An existential action movie that unashamedly embraces the sensation of awe.__Words can do little to convey the visual astonishment this space opera creates. It is a film whose impact must be experienced in 3-D on a theatrical screen to be fully understood.__A wildly suspenseful zero-g tale of survival 350 miles beyond the ozone layer, Alfonso Cuaron's space saga is emotionally jolting - and physically jolting, too.__Yet Gravity also has an emotional and spiritual depth that, like 127 Hours, another film about man versus isolation, transcends what might at first seem a gimmicky plot device.__In one form or another, motion pictures have been with us since the middle of the 19th century, but there's never been one like "Gravity."
It is essentially Revenge of the Nerds, with fur. And scales. And whatever gooey, gelatinous substance comprises the outer coating of various other oddball creatures in this crazy parallel world.__Studios don't often seem to be thinking about the ideal moviegoer, just about the maximum number of moviegoers ... Pixar is no different in that regard, but even in this relatively fallow period ... it's never stopped thinking the most of us.__It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result.__This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets.__As prequels go, Monsters University is pretty nifty.__Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids.__[It] is true to the spirit of the original film, "Monsters Inc.", and matches its tone. But it never seems content to turn over old ground.__[It] conforms to [Pixar's] apparent drift toward the average, with toy sales taking priority over originality.__'Monsters University" is an imaginative, raucous, wildly inventive cartoon of a movie.__What hasn't advanced is the plotting, which was nothing special last time and is so formulaic now that it's basically surprise-free.__Monsters University is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful.__I'm not sure I needed to revisit Mike and Sulley's world 12 years later (or, looked at from their point of view, earlier). But once you find yourself whisked over the threshold, it's a colorful, funny, charming place to spend an afternoon.__Execution matters. Verve, and energy, and inventiveness matter. And Monsters University is funny, fast, and likable, with occasional moments of real visual surprise and laugh-out-loud offhand gags.__The result is a charming addition to the Monsters canon.__Mostly memorable for being fine but forgettable.__It's an awful disappointment-and one more reason to worry about Pixar's future under Disney ownership.__An amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories.__Animation, monsters and the Socratic method? Scanlon and the crew make it work.__Director Dan Scanlon and his creative team pay exquisite attention to each delicious detail, including young Mike's retainer that gleams each time he grins.__Despite its brainy title, "Monsters University" only earns a passing grade on its looks.
The tale has no emotional resonance, and the thinness of the plot (only five of the book's chapters are adapted here) and the colorless depictions of the leading characters do it no favors.__Be forewarned: Whether through ego, avarice, or unchecked enthusiasm, Jackson has wandered deep into the realm of fan fiction.__With the introductions and bag-packing out of the way from the first film, the new movie jumps straight into the action and doesn't relent until the cliffhanger ending almost three hours later.__For the casual but compelled moviegoer, The Desolation of Smaug is a fine improvement over the first offering. Tolkien aficionados may feel otherwise.__Desolation of Smaug looks as dreary as the title would lead you to believe. The whole thing lingers in the memory as piles of sludge and ash.__I'm not an aficionado of J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderworlds and I was bored with the first Hobbit movie. All this is by way of saying I quite liked its sequel and the second in the trilogy.__A wickedly entertaining, sometimes thrilling adventure.__Peter Jackson's newest installment of the Tolkien trilogy is set afire by the scorching roar of a dragon.__The latest lap of their journey is far more focused and much more exciting than the last one.__A relentless adventure tale, teaming with rowdy action, slavering enemies and Elven gymnastics.__It often feels like the movie's title character is marginalized in his own story.__Director Peter Jackson performs the same kind of miracles with the digital Smaug that he did with Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.__Jackson's direction is spiky and majestic ...__The Desolation of Smaug is not only eight minutes shorter than its forebear, it's at least eight minutes better - less twee, less chatty, more action, more Elvish.__"The Desolation of Smaug" is a rip-roaring wizards and lizards escapade that delivers a full quota of thrills while remaining true to the lighthearted spirit of the source material.__Peter Jackson, take a fire-breathing bow.__We were promised desolation, but "The Hobbit" just keeps dragon on.__The chaotic action, amped-up sound effects, and needlessly intricate CGI landscapes (which are less convincing than traditional sets or even the hand-drawn backdrops of Disney classics) wore me out well before the movie was over.__Tolkien is barely there, and Middle-earth lies in ruins.__For many, Jackson's "Hobbit" will look like an overly long amusement-park attraction. But for fantasy fans who have dreamed all their lives of spending time inside Tolkien's dazzling alternative reality, it's a ride well worth taking.
Just as the plot threatens to run out of gas, Lin rescues the film with a spate of vastly ridiculous and therefore enjoyable set-pieces, most of which involve means of conveyance designed to make the cars look puny.__Exists purely to showcase how idiotically over-the-top action sequences can become when annoyances like gravity are tossed to the side.__Some of the action sequences are insane. No, really. Absurd, impossible, physics defying, triage-required stuff. No matter. That's the foolish rush of a franchise that must go faster and faster and furiouser and furiouser.__How you feel about "Fast & Furious 6" is a matter of perspective.__Ludicrous, but undeniably fun and surprisingly affectionate, this is really all you could ask of a car crash movie, and more.__Furious Six continues on in the same vein as its predecessor, and may just be my favorite of the lot.__For their own part, Vin Diesel and the "F&F" handlers seem eager to assert how they've molded a series of installments into, yep, a saga, complete with expansive, twisty continuity.__That the movie is so indifferently written shouldn't really be a surprise. The dialogue is just there to mark time between the set pieces, and it's nice to report that Lin has outdone himself in that department.__Fast & Furious 6 is much like the other Fast & Furious films. Which is to say it does its thing pretty well.__There's a Road Runneresque sense of madness that's undeniably infectious. If only it was played off characters who had some sense of reality, who weren't such obvious constructions, and who spoke fewer leaden lines.__It pretty much goes without saying that the script by Chris Morgan, who penned most of the previous installments, is achingly stupid and beyond ludicrous.__[The action is] glorious while it lasts, but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its oversized vessel from taking on water. And that's more hard work than it's worth.__A satisfying thrill ride, at least on a par with the earlier installments.__If Fast & Furious 6 were any dumber, the script would have been written in crayon ... [But] in terms of sheer action adrenaline, it may be the best film of the franchise.__A comedown from the high of "Fast Five," but the physics-be-damned stuntwork and girl-on-girl beatdowns keep this series the guiltiest of pleasures.__It's a ripsnorting carmageddon that stylizes automotive annihilation the way John Woo used to choreograph death and destruction with guns and explosions.__Sometimes Fast & Furious 6 is engrossing, sometimes absurd, and some of the action is so outlandish it makes the audience laugh. But whatever it is, it's always some variety of fun.__Happily, amid all the noise, the races -- there's a terrific one through the streets of downtown London -- the crashes and the outlandish stunts, there is some humor, and it's very welcome.__[Director Justin Lin] manages to imbue the material with Hawksian notions of masculinity, group dynamics, and moral authority even as he preserves the franchise's multicultural milieu and gleefully exaggerated action sequences.__Perhaps the most annoying thing about the movie: The final scene sets up yet another sequel.
The twister that comes to whirl Oscar into Oz is so preordained you could find its departure information and flight time from an airport travel board.__An imaginative mix of live-action and CGI that pays homage to the iconic images and timeless sense of wonder in the classic The Wizard of Oz without being too deferential.__Oz the Great and Powerful is entirely serviceable family entertainment. Problem is, serviceable doesn't quite cut it when you're talking about the magical land of Oz.__Aside from a trio of witches that can hold its own with Eastwick's in the dishiness department, Oz the Great and Powerful is a peculiarly joyless occasion.__Let us take a moment to praise two great and surprisingly powerful characters: a winged monkey and a wee girl made out of china. Because so much human wonder resides in these two creations of make-up, puppetry, digital effects and lovely performances.__The new Oz falls short of the 1939 Oz in charm and innocence, and certainly in songs. But as family entertainment, it's hard to fault such a rapturous spectacle and astute, suspenseful piece of storytelling.__Oz the Great and Powerful somehow manages to be both slavish to its hallowed template (when convenient) and completely tone-deaf to the magic that made it a one-of-a-kind cultural milestone.__Raimi's film is supposed to be about magic, but magic is in scant supply.__"Oz the Great and Powerful" will likely dazzle family audiences while satisfying movie purists. Somewhere over the rainbow there may be a more magical movie, but this will certainly do.__By the end of the two-hour 10-minute movie, director Sam Raimi proves he understands spectacle but not the deeper dreams of the people who consume it.__A Blunder-full Blizzard of Blahs.__It's a journey of self-discovery, rife with movie cliches about believing in yourself, believing in your dreams, yada-yada.__Where's the gentle sentiment? The quiet moral lessons? The warm comforting message of family, and home, and realizing that the thing you needed most was really inside you, all the time?__Oz the Great and Powerful aims for nostalgia in older viewers who grew up on The Wizard of Oz and still hold the classic dear while simultaneously enchanting a newer, younger audience. It never really accomplishes either successfully.__A visually over-crammed, emotionally empty mega-spectacle on the model of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.__A partially effective jumble whose elements clash rather than cohere, this solid but not spectacular effort stubbornly refuses to catch fire until it's almost too late.__The more you like the Judy Garland film, the more you might appreciate "Oz the Great and Powerful."__Yet, like so many big-budget movies these days, it's hard to care much about what's going on, especially as the film builds to its special-effects-driven conclusion.__[Oz] qualifies as a cautionary tale, not about the perils of ambition and selfishness, but about the movie industry's misguided belief that it can distract the audience from a film's narrative weaknesses with little more than flash and spectacle.__Oz the Great and Powerful tells the story of how the Wizard came to Oz, answering a question I suspect no one was asking, but with considerable digital wizardry.
Most of the logic has leached away from this movie, and with it half of the fun.__Happily, there's a good deal of fun if you like things crashing violently into each other and out of warp-drive at regular intervals.__For all its chasing and falling and fighting-and the movie supplies a great deal of each-Star Trek Into Darkness is at its best when the Enterprise crew are merely bickering and bantering among themselves: less space opera than soap opera.__The conceptual sci-fi of the original series is nowhere to be found, though you might enjoy watching the skinny young actors approximate their counterparts from the 60s; Chris Pine is especially good as Captain Kirk.__While the action is often electric, it's the relationships that matter. That, and a lippy regard for a cultural legacy.__The film is, for whatever else it might be, one of the funniest of the Star Trek entries.__Star Trek Into Darkness is a step forward from Abrams' initial foray into this universe in the 2009 movie.__For two movies in a row now -- and possibly even more in the second than the first -- [Abrams has] caught some of the spark of the first Star Trek without either mimicking or desecrating the original.__The result is a wild piece of entertainment that manages to be about something. Beam yourself up for this one.__J.J. Abrams's Star Trek Into Darkness, the sequel to his prequel, delivers the goods, even if some of the goods are less than fresh.__Rip-roaring set-pieces aside, the biggest pleasure here is still the yin-yang chemistry between Kirk and Spock, even as the writers sand down the barbed edges of the characters' interactions.__Abrams boldly goes into Star Trek Into Darkness, and crushes it again. It's more fun and more intense, without giving less to the characters.__This is sufficiently rousing and entertaining that it should please a majority of movie-goers whether they're confessed Trek fans or not.__I thought it was really fun, an inventive, surprising rethinking of some of "Star Trek's" most hallowed inventions, but I'm not wedded to the source material as gospel. Trekkies will think it's a desecration. So, pick your side.__Star Trek Into Darkness offers [a] qualified satisfaction, which, especially after the second half, is akin to the relief of surviving a long beating.__Into Darkness is a sleek, thrilling epic that's also a triumphantly witty popcorn morality play. It's everything you could want in a Star Trek movie.__What this movie does with a not-unfamiliar-to-some story is pretty clever, and the incarnation of a classic villain by British cheekbone virtuoso Benedict Cumberbatch is vivid and engaging.__It's a great deal of brash fun, and it should satisfy all those basic Trekkie cravings.__For all its reckoning with mass destruction, this franchise's vision of a future Earth remains optimistic. The film mixes the iconically familiar with the futuristic.__Star Trek Into Darkness banishes, at least for the moment, the lugubrious mood and sepulchral look that too many comic-book movies mistake for sophistication. All hail an action film that isn't ashamed to have fun and to be seen doing it.
Thor: The Dark World is a good model of how superheroes can save the world without forced gravitas, and have fun doing it.__Enough with the appetite-whetting experiments. Just wake me when The Avengers: Age of Ultron is here.__A wildly uneven but entertaining sequel to one of Marvel Comics' most enduring franchises.__The Crocodile Dundee II of superhero films-in a good way!__Though hardly a must-see, Thor: The Dark World is better than the original: a looser, loopier hybrid of science fiction and fantasy powered by a pair of magnetic performances and leavened with a number of truly witty moments.__Like so many comic book epics these days, Alan Taylor's 3-D Thor: The Dark World is both monumental and generic.__Thor is essentially Marvel's answer to Superman and, as with The Man of Steel, it can be difficult to craft a tale around a hero who is essentially invincible.__True, this sequel gets better as it goes along, but that's a very steep climb just to arrive at not bad.__Can we please cease and desist with movies where not just the fate of a person, or a family, or a city, or even a world but where THE FATE OF ALL EXISTENCE is at stake? Wouldn't it be nice to see a superhero simply rescue a puppy sometime?__Its monsters and angry armies and visual effects are interchangeable with Peter Jackson's Tolkien pics, with Clash of the Titans, with The Avengers, with Man of Steel, and on and on.__When the battles kicked in, semi-yawn. We've seen it all before.__If I'm spending that much time studying Odin's grooming, there's something wrong with the story, which is kind of slow to get going and features too many undeveloped threads.__This action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts.__Dancing above a leaden plot and lumpy dialogue, Mr. Hiddleston moves his fine-boned features and graceful body, as if what he were doing matters; he seems imported from a quite different movie.__Dimensions collide, and Taylor allows the film to hurtle with the force of Thor's hammer into pure popcorn-spectacle territory.__The latest chapter in Marvel's never-ending story takes a while to find its narrative momentum, but its later, better scenes have a loony oomph that drowns out your misgivings.__Abundant laughter saves the picture from thudding like the Thunder God's hammer.__"Thor: The Dark World," unfortunately, makes good on its portentous title.__It's like a smorgasbord designed to give fans all they can eat -- or a roadside 24-hour buffet that clocks in, blessedly, at a mere two hours. Its welcoming air and variety can't fully disguise its lack of top-notch ingredients.__Not enough Loki. Too many tacky 3D effects. And then there's the hard fact that everything old isn't necessarily new again just because the bottom line wishes it so.
[A] lousy, ugly-looking, intensely illogical movie.__As both thrilling spectacle and escapist summer entertainment, World War Z is enormously effective, with Brad Pitt at the center hopscotching the globe in search of the origin of a zombie apocalypse.__Pitt conducts himself manfully throughout the proceedings -- he is never less than believable while facing off against this pandemic -- but if I never see another zombie in the movies, I will not feel deprived.__If you need proof that sometimes more can be less, here you go.__As compelling as Pitt is at reflecting the world's pain through Lane's eyes, the movie treats him too often as if he truly is the only one with loved ones to lose or a world to save.__World War Z hits the blockbuster equivalent of a delicate balance: gargantuan spectacle with a human touch.__World War Z opens with an undeniable bang. But if this is the way the world ends, we're going out with a whimper.__Despite some conventional passages and a soft ending, Forster and Brad Pitt, who is a producer of the film as well as its star, pulled the picture together. They also managed to reawaken in a large-scale movie the experience of shock.__Director Marc Forster can't do much with the stale human story, in which Pitt leaves his frightened wife and daughters on an aircraft carrier to await his return.__Z has guts and energy. It starts its mayhem early and it never lets up.__World War Z is a perfectly decent thriller, the smartest and most sober action film so far this summer and a grown-up addition to the zombie canon.__Whatever problems World War Z encountered in its making, the movie has made it to theaters not dead on arrival, but walking dead, running dead, and - when it's really working - swarming dead.__The result is a movie that, while no classic, can be credited with giving the audience something a bit more substantive than the usual disposable summer fare.__Against considerable odds, the ability and professionalism of the cast and crew have carried the day.__[It] does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to find interesting ways to pass the time within them.__Given how efficiently World War Z has delivered jolts and screams over the course of its sleek 116-minute running time, it's easy to forgive [its] rushed and slightly muted finale.__This enjoyable shambles of a sci-fi thriller, directed by Marc Forster in impressive 3-D, stands on its own as a powerful vision of planetary chaos.__A relentless horror thriller that serves up a chilling vision of a planet in the throes of apocalypse ...__A letdown with a strange mixture of epic apocalyptic material and generic zombie stuff.__The choreography is thought out, and the use of 3-D is at least good enough that I embarrassed myself, leaping in my seat to get out of the way of a zombie that was falling on me.
The Croods isn't particularly smart, but it has just enough wit to keep us engaged and just enough speed to keep us from feeling restless.__It captures the wonder (and more gently, the anxiety) of discovery time and time again. And the filmmakers have a hoot playing with the Croods' encounters with, as well as their misunderstandings of, all things new.__As family viewing, it's pleasant enough: primitive, yes, but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous, funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys.__The animation is first-rate, with moments of genuine visual imagination, and the story, while unremarkable, is entirely adequate.__How to Train Your Dragon" and "Lilo & Stitch" are completely indicative of the experience you'll have with "The Croods," which is to say a supremely positive one.__It may not be an instant animated classic, but it's a charmer that will leave the kids ... feeling warm and fuzzy ...__A film which, if not truly sophisticated, isn't nearly as crude as advertised.__The family-dramedy genre that the film inhabits demands a bit more narrative ingenuity than is on display.__Fast-paced, inventive animated comic adventure of a Stone Age family gets an extra boost from the lively vocal performances of stars Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds.__While their situation sounds dire, "The Croods" is not. The DreamWorks animated film has enough slapstick humor, furry sidekicks and zippy 3-D action sequences to keep the story light.__Even the lively visuals and unrelenting thrill-ride pace can't disguise rough-hewn storytelling, or the fact that the tale of a old-fashioned macho cave dad and his family seems a bit yabba-dabba done that already.__This movie not only has its heart in the right place, it has its brain in the right place.__I'd like to take back all those times I said Nicolas Cage was one of the most annoying actors on film. It turns out he's equally terrible when he's only on the soundtrack.__"The Croods" is light fare, but it explores a serious theme, if only superficially.__It's the kind of rib-tickling, emotionally satisfying, universally appealing effort that gives computer animation a good name.__Like the continents, it's a little too easy to drift away.__[It] might even give the little ones something more challenging to think about than its tired main plot.__The pace is brisk and occasionally slapstick, and some amusing situations stem from the cavemen displaying brawn over brains.__Had the movie figured out a way to stay the less-cliched course, it might have helped the DreamWorks oeuvre take steps toward Pixar's emotional resonance.__Considering the fact that a young girl is picking her nose on the movie poster, "The Croods" is surprisingly evolved.
McCarthy's an actress who needs a foil, and for now Bullock is more than good enough. I just wish these two had found each other 10 years ago.__Director Paul Feig, whose Bridesmaids upended notions of what a raunchy ensemble comedy could be, does it again here with another genre.__If you've never seen the point of Sandra Bullock, watch this.__There are only two reasons to see The Heat. But they are formidable reasons, and they go by the names of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy.__If you've never seen Sandra Bullock blow a peanut shell out of her nose, and you'd like to, The Heat is your movie.__The many formulas never mesh, and some formidable actors stumble trying to keep pace with its out-of-synch meters.__If this were funny, The Heat would add up to your average buddy-cop comedy. Except that it's not funny, at least not very and not often.__There's an edgy but rewarding chemistry between Bullock and McCarthy that makes me wish they were attached to a less foul-tasting premise.__Laughter can be magical. It can also be crass. In the formidable person of Melissa McCarthy it is typically both. And no director seems to know what to do with that tension quite like Paul Feig.__It's not really such a great achievement to have women cops in the movies acting as boorish and rowdy as their male counterparts.__... a rapid-fire script and the inspired pairing of Bullock and McCarthy make 'The Heat' one of the funniest films of the year so far.__The Heat come, they conquer, and they leave you laughing.__Bullock has played this role so many times you wonder why she's bothering. And while McCarthy can be brilliant in small doses, her foul-mouthed tough gal bit wears thin quickly.__[Feig] clearly enjoys the spectacle of women behaving badly, and gives his stars - and particularly McCarthy - plenty of room and improv time to knock back shots, bust a move and beat up men until they squeal like little girls.__Give these ladies a genuinely smart, funny script -- and give McCarthy more to play than what has become a tiresome tomboy shtick -- and there's no telling what liberated heights they can reach.__It's disappointing that "The Heat" doesn't do more than take an established film template - in this case, the buddy-cop flick - throw in a Tarantino-size helping of F-bombs, cast a couple of women and call it a day.__It's a slob comedy that goes with crippling speed from smart to dumb and then from dumber to dumbest.__Bullock specializes in awkward and uptight, McCarthy in aggressive and unfiltered. "The Heat" makes the most of those differences.__The Heat is the best female buddy-cop movie since, well, ever.__The cookie-cutter plot might have worked if the jokes were good.
The movie's lingering close-ups on yearning faces and heart-to-heart conversations force the fake Millers into real familial longing that's more bogus than the family itself.__With jokes cloned from bad taste movies and off-kids-telly villains, it doesn't even qualify for dumb fun.__Stays mean and maintains a bit of an edge even when it threatens to go all soft and gooey.__The baseline for American movie humor sinks once again in this sentimentally cynical and cynically sentimental farce.__It boils down to the idea that men and women alike yearn for what they don't have, and that making your way through life is about seizing the bizarre opportunities it thrusts at you.__Though incredibly predictable from start to finish, "We're the Millers" did make me laugh.__'We're the Millers' clicks on just enough cylinders to warrant a recommendation.__a movie written by a committee, too long, but the cast carries it a long way, these mild virtues don't quite add up to a recommendation, but if you said you wanted to see it I wouldn't block the door.__Some of the jokes are funny. If one was to compile all the good snippets and scenes into a highlight reel, it might run about six minutes.__The filmmakers lack the courage of their convictions, falling back on moments of egregiously false sentimentality whenever the material threatens to turn dark.__The result is a loose conglomeration of jokes that never really holds together: Funny in parts, but overwhelmed by the bland emptiness where its protagonist should be.__Even tastelessness needs to have some taste. The blue humor in We're the Millers is just bland.__The laughs may come in fits and starts, usually by way of sight gags and set pieces, but they do come. And then they go.__"We're the Millers" plays like a "Saturday Night Live" skit that goes on too long.__Not only is it not funny, it's offensive.__This film's eagerness to please functions as a slow poison, draining The Millers of its vitality by rendering its characterization uneven, its potential undeveloped, and its plot predictable and stupid.__A laugh-out-loud comic trek that avoids being either too crude or too docile. If a summer of high-impact blockbusters has left you worn out, join the Millers for a laugh.__We're The Millers asks you to believe that somewhere in this world there's a pot dealer who prides himself on not selling to kids and a stripper who never takes her bra off.__Loud and annoying? Occasionally. Funny? Sometimes. Likely to be noticed by filmgoers six months from now? Not really.__An innocuously smutty road comedy starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston.
Save your admiration for the performances, especially Lawrence, who is now Hollywood's most important presence in front of the camera.__It turns out that comb-overs, cleavage, cocaine and kookiness are an unbeatable combo.__Director David O. Russell and co-writer Eric Warren Singer grab hold of the FBI's long-time Abscam sting (conducted in the late '70s into 1980) as their kernel of truth, then Jiffy Pop it like mad.__Ambitious even as it studies, exploits and explodes ambition, "American Hustle" is as good as any American film this year. It's also a lot of fun. Don't miss it.__American Hustle is a movie built on that cornerstone of the American Dream, reinvention. If you're not happy with who you are, or who people think you are, then go ahead and become somebody else. Anything to survive - and thrive.__The source of this movie's galvanizing intrigue is that the characters remain in play -- they never settle into place__It's one of the year's cleverest films, and also one of the best.__A sloppy, miscast, hammed up, overlong, overloud story that still sends you out of the theater on a cloud of rapture.__"American Hustle" may have taken its inspiration from the art of the steal, but it has a heart of pure, if slightly tarnished, gold.__Even at two hours and 20 minutes, the movie doesn't wear you down. It carries you along with heedless momentum, giddy and exhilarated at its all-American ambition and scam-artist confidence.__With a solid-gold cast and a sterling script, "American Hustle" has a higher return on investment than any other movie in the marketplace.__[Russell] seems to be having obscene amounts of fun, which becomes contagious very quickly.__Filled with rich characters and sharp dialogue, the movie turns on questions of friendship and fidelity, both personal and political, with a knockout performance by Jennifer Lawrence as the con man's jealous, ball-busting wife.__To borrow a phrase the film's con artists are prone to saying, American Hustle works from the feet up, and the fun is intoxicating.__Russell, following last year's sweet "The Silver Linings Playbook" with a very different tale of reinvention, has made a glittery disco ball of a movie, with Lawrence as its unexpectedly shining star.__Russell has always had a talent for harmonizing tragedy and comedy, seriousness and outlandishness, all within a precise tone that allows for a wide range of emotions and effects. But his hand has never been more sure.__It's hilarious and sad and, especially, entertaining.__I wouldn't call American Hustle my kind of movie, but perversely, I have to admit I enjoyed it, primarily because of the twisted logic and wicked cleverness.__The best time I've had at the movies all year.__The film zigs and zags, chasing after many different characters. And that sprawl, the rogue's gallery of strays, cheaters and deceivers, activates the film rather than deflates it.
For all the antic, manic itchiness of his Gatsby, for all the jazz hands, the movie doesn't reach out and grab you.__It's stupefying, it's vulgar, it's demeaning-it's dull and there's nothing like the dullness that is trying to be a sensation.__There are no two ways about it: The Great Gatsby is misconceived and misjudged, a crude burlesque on what's probably American literature's most precious jewel.__The central problem with Luhrmann's film is that when it's entertaining it's not Gatsby, and when it's Gatsby it's not entertaining.__The best attempt yet to capture the essence of the novel.__A failure that should have at least been a magnificent mistake.__"The Great Gatsby" is a cool movie, in both the positive and negative sense. You may certainly be impressed, but you may not be moved.__It's a terrific adaptation that succeeds not only as a work of cinema but also, wonderfully, as proof of the novel's greatness.__The best thing about Baz Luhrmann's much-anticipated/much-dreaded The Great Gatsby is that, for all its computer-generated whoosh and overbroad acting, it is unmistakably F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. That is no small deal.__Baz Luhrmann's razzmatazz and bombast -- in 3D! -- overwhelm the subtle poetry of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel.__It is, as I suspected, a gargantuan hunk of over-art-directed kitsch, but it makes for a grandiose, colorful, pleasure-drenched night at the movies.__This dreadful film even derogates the artistry of Fitzgerald, who wrote "The Great Gatsby" while living on Long Island and in Europe.__Luhrmann takes great care with the rhythms of individual scenes, yet the film as a whole plays like a long trudge through a familiar story.__As unlikely as it might seem, high-energy director Baz Luhrmann has in fact crafted a somnambulant motion picture.__Baz Luhrmann is exactly the wrong person to adapt such a delicately rendered story, and his 3D feature plays like a ghastly Roaring 20s blowout at a sorority house.__Luhrmann hasn't unlocked the secrets of a story that remains all but unfilmable, but his Gatsby is far more than a collection of superficial splashes and tics.__Even while being admirably faithful to so much of the novel's language, Luhrmann and Pearce still can't quite maneuver Carraway's more cautionary contours about America.__Despite timely relevance, enduring truths and Luhrmann's earnest efforts to make The Great Gatsby jump off the screen, he -- and we -- finally can't help but fail to grasp it.__Fitzgerald's sensibility is delicately nuanced, but there's steel in his melancholy. With Luhrmann, everything, not just the parties but the intimate scenes, turns into Mardi Gras.__Leonardo DiCaprio gives us the full Gatsby, assured yet insecure, and he's magnificent, but the movie ends up romanticizing what Fitzgerald spent the book de-romanticizing.
Every hand that reaches into a wardrobe, every nervous trip into that basement just gets on your nerves. Satan needs to get over himself.__In The Conjuring, the scary casts out the spirit of the silly, permanently, and with a vengeance.__The Conjuring uses every stock scare in the horror movie playbook for a dumb, yet charmingly traditional haunted house picture that manages to feel more retro than rehashed.__Wan builds mounting dread with silence and suspense, lingering the camera unsettlingly long here, creaking a door there.__Wan ... builds the many bumps in the night into a small Hitchcockian symphony of terror by way of long, eerie tracking shots, dramatic silences, and sudden scares that are frighteningly immersive.__...there were moments where it seemed the entire theater was holding its breath. We were united in one feeling: terror.__The horror movie is artfully crafted from the first scares to the closing credits, with a bold retro vibe.__This is a horror film where a pair of suddenly clapping hands gives you the heebie-jeebies, and Wan doesn't cheat with his jump scares.__Without recourse to the gruesome S&M excesses of his "Saw" franchise, Wan conjures the chill of a demon breathing down your neck.__An uncommonly intense and frightening experience.__... it surpasses the hallmarks of its genre with an actually dramatic storyline and all-around solid acting. Just don't think you can go see it alone.__It scared the living crap out of me. Only at the movies is that a compliment. So kudos to The Conjuring for putting fresh fire into the overworked haunted-house genre.__[Wan's] entire film is possessed - by other films.__As "The Conjuring" progresses, the scares don't register beyond standard issue horror gotchas. They're as telegraphed as the musical cues alerting you something spooky is about to happen.__"The Conjuring'' depends more on its excellent cast and atmospheric direction than cheap gimmicks to raise hairs on the back of your neck. Which it does, quite frequently.__[Wan] cuts The Conjuring into two halves -- an exhilarating haunted-house thriller and a grueling post-Exorcist horror film -- but they don't come back together in a living, breathing whole.__Unexpectedly fresh, alive, and vibrant - and wonderfully traumatizing.__One of the scarier haunted house/demon possession movies in recent years, it brings to mind '70s supernatural horror films such as The Exorcist with its stillness, steady build of suspense and handsome cinematography.__The dread gathers and surges while the blood scarcely trickles in "The Conjuring," a fantastically effective haunted-house movie.__This saga of demonic possession deploys the full audio firepower of modern multiplexes, and does so with brain-battering frequency, like a ghostbusting version of a Japanese Taiko drum ensemble.
You don't care enough about these people to want to see them come out on top.__It saddles Bateman with a thankless uptight straight-man role while heaping serial slapstick ignominies on his co-star, who gamely bounds through everything the script throws at her.__Identity Thief is funny enough, but it needed to be darker, raunchier, and crazier to live up to the promise of its casting.__Even with all its shortcomings and sentimental fudges, there is something about McCarthy's refusal to lie down and play the victim that gives it a comic edge. A blunt edge, to be sure, but an edge all the same.__[A] sloppily made exercise of rip-offs and redemption.__Considering that it starts out with two distinctive and likable stars and a reasonably promising premise, "Identity Thief" reaches impressive heights of laziness and idiocy.__Identity Thief apparently forgets it was supposed to be a comedy.__"Identity Thief" is a cheap copy of much better comedies.__[Identity Thief] exhausts most of the comic potential from identity theft in the first 20 minutes and then turns into a solid but unexceptional road picture.__Thanks to McCarthy's abundant comic gifts and those of her equally ill-served straight man Jason Bateman, Identity Thief doesn't leave nearly as icky a taste as it could have, but Gordon only taps into a fraction of his actors' potential.__A lot of movies released into theaters deserve the label of "bad." Only a few cross the line into "reprehensible." Say hello to Identity Thief.__''Identity Thief'' strands these two ordinarily enjoyable comics in the middle of nowhere with no help for miles.__Bateman and McCarthy are left stranded onscreen while we are supposed to be chortling at slobber comedy and fat jokes.__The whole thing's not much of anything, really - just a little more than an hour-and-a-half of crude jokes and clumsy plotting, all wrapped up with a feel-good ribbon at the end.__Really, this a two-hander that unfolds at two distinctly separate speeds.__We can forgive the silly setup, without which there can be no film, but like many a road movie, this one has a better start and finish than middle.__"Identity Thief" is not only not funny. It's negative funny. It's short on laughs, but it will disturb and annoy.__Its stars, Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, steal so many laughs from such improbable places that the bumps in this revenge/road trip farce can be mostly forgiven, though not forgotten.__What a bummer.__[It] manages to make off with just enough laughs to work, thanks to the wondrous McCarthy, one of the few actresses in Hollywood allowed to showcase her wit and charisma as much as her physique.
Sandler's films have always been stupid, but the early stuff is pretty harmless; here the jokes almost always come at the expense of someone else, the kind of needless bullying one expects of a YouTube comment section.__These movies are about four friends -- played by comedians -- remembering what it was like to be young. How much better for an audience would it be if they remembered what it was like to make comedy?__Grown Ups 2 delivers exactly what it's been advertising in trailers and on talk shows: grubby low-comic escapism.__This is pap, plain and simple: scattered raunch-lite devoid of emotional resonance.__It makes the first movie look like The Maltese Falcon.__A movie of fools, by fools, for fools.__Friendship, family and breasts: Sometimes that's all you need.__When Taylor Lautner is the funniest thing in a movie starring Adam Sandler and Chris Rock, we're in trouble.__The fact that some moments are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny almost makes the whole endeavor sadder.__The movie lurches from one gross-out scene to another, flipping the bird at continuity and logic. It honestly seems as if Sandler and his team descended on a random suburb, halfheartedly improvising and moving on when they got bored.__[The] lazy, scattershot and anything-but-mature sequel to the leaden Grown-Ups.__Grown Ups Minus 2 would be more apt.__In certain ways, Grown Ups 2 marks a return to classically Sandlerian infantile anarchy.__Apparently the world demanded another family-friendly version of "The Hangover," one that combined scatological comedy with smarmy sentimentality.__Nobody escapes untainted by the foul stench of Grown Ups 2.__For all its warm and fuzzy notions of family and community, Grown Ups 2, directed by longtime Sandler cohort Dennis Dugan, has a desperate reliance on nasty jokes about pee, poo and -- with surprising frequency -- gay panic.__Grown Ups 2 looks like it was a lot of fun to make. And the last laugh is on us.__Adam Sandler scrapes the bottom of the barrel -- and then he pukes into it -- with Grown Ups 2...__It's hard to imagine another comedy coming along this year that is this abrasive and free of laughs. It's like everyone involved intentionally tried to create a horrible movie.__The temptation arises to say something nice about "Grown Ups 2" just because it doesn't cause injury. But no, it's a bad movie, just old-school bad, the kind that's merely lousy and not an occasion for migraines or night sweats.
It's a relief to come across a blockbuster that finds a location and stays there, rather than hopping desperately from one place to the next ...__Getting [Wolverine] to the movie's above-average finale required three writers - Christopher McQuarrie, Mark Bomback, and Scott Frank - to pad the plot.__It restores the tarnished lustre to this most fan-beloved of Marvel characters by doing precisely what Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's near-sacred 1982 run did: It pumps some feeling into the guy along with his muscles and steel talons.__Director James Mangold's film features some breathtakingly suspenseful action sequences, exquisite production and costume design and colorful characters, some of whom register more powerfully than others.__Too quickly the random fights pile up -- so many yakuza thugs who forgot to wear chain mail that morning -- and you yearn for the film that might have been.__Mangold front-loads the action, but near the end there's a first-rate fight atop a bullet train between Wolverine/Logan and some especially pesky ninjas. It puts the train fights in the recent The Lone Ranger to shame.__Just as comic-book movie fatigue was starting to set in, along comes The Wolverine to revive a moribund summer of superheroes.__The idea of Wolverine fighting off waves of yakuza and ninjas amid shoji screens is tantalizing, but Mangold bungles the staging and cuts so fast that you can't ever savor their silhouettes.__It's a credit to the production team that these elements somehow work, with the movie at its best as a superhero/Asian crime drama mash-up.__Although The Wolverine eventually falls back on a comic-book formula and CG effects (the climactic face-off between Logan and a giant silver warriorlike thing is totally generic), Mangold and his team find time to explore more nuanced realms ...__This is a serious, sometimes dark and deliberately paced story.__A handful of bold ideas brought down by the need to regress to a blander, more box-office-friendly middle ground.__The Wolverine represents a strain of faux gravitas that squeezes nearly all the fun out of blockbuster moviemaking. Here we have multimillion-dollar proof that slow and unsure can be just as dull as hyperkinetic chaos.__A refreshing summer cocktail of action-movie staples, The Wolverine combines the bracingly adult flavor of everyone's favorite mutant antihero with the fizzy effervescence of several mixers from the cabinet of Japanese genre cinema.__It has a more absorbing story and intriguing sensibility than Iron Man 3 or Man of Steel, and even when its action falters, this film is more original and exotic.__"The Wolverine" is an erratic affair, more lumbering than compelling, an ambitious film with its share of effective moments that stubbornly refuses to catch fire.__Instead of expounding a tedious origin story or staging an epic battle for apocalyptic stakes, "The Wolverine" focuses on a specific and self-contained adventure in a richly imagined place.__Like most superhero films, "The Wolverine" depends mostly on sheer mechanics -- both in front of and behind the camera -- and on that level it's a resounding success.__The film is a misconceived misfire, over-solemn for its first two acts and overstuffed with BLAM! POW! TEDIUM! at the climax.__A movie so unspectacular and meaningless it might be mistaken for an old episode of "The Incredible Hulk."
Ferrell and McKay were so determined to tell new Burgundy jokes that they didn't appear to care what they were about or whether they were any good.__Worth a watch despite occasional laugh-free stretches ...__The whole thing goes down like a second, giant tumbler of scotchy scotch scotch: familiar, comforting and, ultimately, numbing.__At its best, McKay and Ferrell's brand of homegrown American Dada can make you collapse laughing in your seat and cry uncle.__Wine connoisseurs would call this a new Burgundy with an old bouquet.__This is the kind of movie where most people know what they want and are pretty sure what they will get, that being "more of the same, please."__Too much of a good thing isn't always a good thing, especially if you don't think the good thing was so good in the first place.__The jokes are more weird than funny, and Ferrell and Carell, never the most subtle of performers, labor to put them across by bellowing, howling, and screeching.__Fans have been clamoring for a sequel to Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy for so long, Will Ferrell (and financier Paramount Pictures) finally decided to give the people what they wanted. The moral of the story? Be careful what you wish for.__See it with a crowd, laugh yourself silly, and feel slightly ashamed in the morning.__At two hours, Anchorman 2 overstays its welcome by at least 20 minutes, if not longer.__When is a movie fall-down funny even when some scenes fall flat on their fat ones? When it's Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.__Considering the improvisatory talents - even genius - of Ferrell and his co-stars, it's no surprise that laughs abound in "Anchorman 2" ...__Can there be too much of a good thing? Where did that expression come from, anyway? If it's good, isn't more always better?__It's a pinata at which Ferrell & Co. swing away wildly. They often miss their mark, but when they connect, out fall the laughs in great big bunches.__If Anchorman 2 seems hit-and-miss now, there's a significant chance that it will get funnier over the long haul.__For almost every aspect of the movie I want to criticize, there is a corresponding defense.__Of course, the plot is pretty much beside the point in a film like this one. What we want are jokes that are as comforting and familiar as the laugh track on a sitcom rerun.__Burgundy and his goofball buddies are faced with dramas and dilemmas that may seem arbitrary and contrived on paper but have an urgent puissance onscreen, as Ferrell and company act their little hearts out. OK, not really.__While I'm glad "Anchorman" is back - we need a little levity in this year of heavy films - I do wish it were better.
Lone Survivor isn't always sophisticated ... But there's moral complexity and a climax in an Afghan village which is tense and surprisingly moving.__Lone Survivor' hits home and hits hard.__The film effectively assaults its audience almost as aggressively as its subjects.__The film's director, Peter Berg, wants to immerse you so deeply that you feel as if your bones are breaking, too. There's a price, of course, for that kind of immersion: It becomes tough to see the movie for the drum-beating.__Lone Survivor is a brutally effective movie, made by people who think that they're serving their country. But they're just making us coarser and more self-centered.__Berg's fine achievement is in relaying that sense of abject danger even as he and his actors honor the utter connection of the men who lost their lives that day.__The sensation of being pinned down and shot apart is so harrowingly conveyed by Peter Berg's fact-based war movie Lone Survivor that one almost forgives the movie's failure to be quite as persuasive in almost every other respect.__It's hard to be all that you can be when you're a corpse. In essence, the film admires the team but exposes the game. And the game is ugly indeed.__A step-by-fateful-step study of human endurance, of desperation, of resolve, and resignation.__Lone Survivor comes on like a raised fist.__Berg gives us a movingly bullet-chipped plaque of a drama that's good as far as it goes. But it doesn't go far enough anymore.__We might look through the movie toward appreciating what the actual men went through, but that alone can't turn "Lone Survivor" into a satisfying movie experience.__What's missing here is something, or rather, someone, to care about.__Gripping, unrelenting, brutally proficient moviemaking, a just-the-facts war movie about four Navy SEALS on an Afghan mission gone fatally wrong.__This has relatively little to say about why the U.S. armed forces invaded Afghanistan in the first place, but it's effective as genre filmmaking and surprisingly respectful in its depiction of non-Taliban Afghans.__Like the best war movies, Lone Survivor laces action with moral questions that haunt and provoke.__A virtuoso, brutal rendering of a SEAL team's fight for life in a forbidding patch of Afghanistan.__Wahlberg remains one of our most reliable and least actorly of movie stars, innately macho but vulnerable enough to seem like a human being caught in an inhuman situation.__Not since 2001's "Black Hawk Down" has the bloody chaos of war been so graphically portrayed in a Hollywood feature.__Berg avoids jingoism. These are men doing their job, one that is unfathomable for most of us.
Did you think a second G.I. Joe movie was a good idea?__The filmmakers appear to have handed a dozen or so G.I. Joe dolls to a 9-year-old, watched him play for 110 minutes, and then shot a scene-for-scene remake.__What a blast G.I. Joe: Retaliation is! And then another blast, and another, in a series of concussive jolts that shred any conventional sense of story as thoroughly as anything since the last Michael Bay film.__When it comes to big and loud, this is the movie to beat for at least this week; what makes it entertaining is its unabashed wallow in these qualities ...__Plays like a tiresomely extended evening of channel surfing.__No go, "Joe."__Retaliation is less a sequel than an antidote to the calcified mound of crap that ostensibly inspired it.__What's the difference between an action figure and an action star? Very little in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which features no performances of note, even from such combat-tested thespians as Bruce Willis, Jonathan Pryce and Dwayne Johnson.__There should be a "Fans Only" sign at the door of every theater.__I won't pretend that I had a great time watching "G.I. Joe: Retaliation."__Ever played a video game with a friend and had to sit there while he hogged it, leaving you to do nothing but watch for what seemed like hours?__Movies like GI Joe: Retaliation want to give you the video-game equivalent of an itchy trigger-finger. It's an emotion-free zone.__Good luck recalling any other would-be set pieces a couple of days after you've seen Retaliation.__It's not stoopid anymore, but just plain stupid.__People may flock to G.I. Joe: Retaliation despite its inert illogic. But don't say you weren't warned. As a wise man once said, "knowing is half the battle."__To borrow from Jack in the Box, "G. I. Joe: Retaliation" is one hot mess.__Unmitigated nonsense to anyone but diehard fans.__A lumbering beast, bogged down by too many characters and an incomprehensible plot.__Like a Dumpster bin behind Tiffany's, this contains nothing but well-packaged garbage.__A more sure-footed shoot-'em-up that finds some heart, wit and perhaps enough momentum to spawn a formidable action franchise.
Imagine a Jurassic Park constructed entirely out of whatever foodstuff best satisfies your appetite for a pun.__The animation is inventive and elastic, the dialogue zippy and shamelessly punny, and the tone lighthearted and fun, even if on a whole it's not quite a full meal.__Suspend your ideas about what is logical or truly real and just have a nice 90-minute escape into the brightly colorful world directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn and their team have created here.__Even with new cooks in the kitchen, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a completely delicious dish, as it adds a handful of great new ingredients to a familiar recipe.__A humorous yet unfocused romp, so unwilling to settle on a single theme that hyperactivity medication should be handed out with the 3-D glasses.__This scrumptious sequel follows the same recipe as the 2009 original.__It's all very cute and awesomely disgusting, like a 9-year-old stuffing his face full of food and then pressing his cheeks to make it all explode out. (Nine-year-olds still do that, right?)__Honestly, anyone who can pull off a running joke about leeks that does not make you gag, and is in fact a silly delight, deserves props.__There's not a surprise or moment of tension to be found here, but the film is all energy and color that makes the discomfort of 3-D glasses seem worth it.__It's another brightly rendered effort, but, as the title indicates, a lot of the real creativity seems to have been used up the first time around.__Sometimes so strange, colorful and wildly cute that it may end up becoming a "Yellow Submarine" for a new generation.__Mostly, "Cloudy 2" relies on the usual noxious recipe for junky kid flicks: loud noise, pop music and poop jokes.__Whelk, I hope the makers of "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" earned a nice celery, but I'm afraid they made a hash of things. A hash seasoned with oy sauce.__Kids will chuckle, for sure. But parents who were pleasantly surprised by the original film's intelligence will miss Lord and Miller's guiding hands, as what once felt so funny now leaves a stale taste.__An innocuous time-waster, "Cloudy 2" will surely be a family smash.__Some might find these tiresome, but let's just note here that this is a kid movie, and KIDS LOVE PUNS. So they laugh at ''There's a leek in the boat.'' And they laugh even more the second time.__Loud, weird and chaotic - just as kids like it.__It's the rare [sequel] that takes the spirit of the original and runs with it, coming up with something uniquely good in its own right.__Better in every respect than the original "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."__By the time a marshmallow blinks its goggle-eyes, you may be convinced you've wandered into the ultimate Japanese grocery store - or perhaps snuck in a very special brownie
Bustling, glittery, uninvolving.__Complicated nonsense about four professional magicians caught up in an elaborate revenge plot.__If you're OK with the film playing you for a sap, you'll laugh and clap and wonder how that bird got into that hat. But if you think there's a difference between being tricked and being cheated, you may feel swindled.__Leterrier also tries to pack an extraordinary amount of story and twists into a fairly ordinary running time, resulting in editing so choppy that sometimes even the easy parts are hard to follow.__This would-be "Ocean's Eleven" of the magic world remains watchable throughout, even as it plods along without ever quite fulfilling its potential.__One of those movies with a terrific premise and a less-than-terrific follow-through.__Boasting a terrific cast and a flimsy plot whose logic disappears faster than a rabbit in a hat, Now struggles to pull off its cinematic sleights of hand.__The more you see of the movie and the more elaborate the tricks get, the less you are inclined to believe that humans rather than machines are in charge of the illusions.__All too quickly ... the smoke clears and Now You See Me proves to be less than meets the eye.__For all the talent up on the screen - and one can't fault the performances - the movie just doesn't deliver.__Ultimately "Now You See Me" promises more than it delivers, though its cast is always fun to watch and the pace never lags. It has the magic for a while ... and then it disappears.__Much of what makes "Now You See Me" so entertaining - in a gaudy, disposable, Vegas act sort of way - is its ever-escalating ridiculousness.__The outrageous setup more than suffices, and the film gets a lift from offbeat characters.__This is one of those mystery thrillers that are supposed to culminate in a big shocker ending, though the script piles up so many implausibilities that by the time the ending arrives, nothing is surprising anymore.__With Now You See Me, director Louis Leterrier has taken a page out of the book of his characters: use sleight-of-hand so viewers are distracted from some rather obvious screenplay deficiencies.__Director Louis Leterrier has the energy but not the visual grace to match the elegant malefactions of his characters.__Exudes self-importance and can't help but make promises it can't deliver on.__Now You See Me is a superficially diverting but substance-free concoction, a would-be thriller as evanescent as a magic trick and one that develops no suspense or rooting interest because the characters possess all the substance of invisible ink.__The movie may think it's pulling a rabbit out of a hat. But it's more like a turkey.__The scatterbrained story loses its thread and becomes a dull, frenetic chase movie ...
DiCaprio has hinted before that comedy might be his natural calling -- think of Catch Me If You Can -- but his energy here is not just fun, it's discovery.__For three hours the movie operates at a ridiculous comedic pitch. You never forget you're at the circus. You never lose site of the lawlessness, the reckless pleasure, the sheer lunacy and lack of regulation.__Scorsese unleashes a furious, yet exquisitely controlled, kinetic energy, complete with a plunging and soaring camera, mercurial and conspicuous special effects, counterfactual scenes, subjective fantasies, and swirling choreography on a grand scale.__The Wolf of Wall Street is a magnificent black comedy: fast, funny, and remarkably filthy.__Man, does this movie have a savage bite.__I couldn't buy it, and couldn't wait for the hollow spectacle to end.__It's hard not to feel there is a better revisit of Scorsese's crime gem already in theaters, David O. Russell's American Hustle.__Though "Raging Bull" must still go down as Martin Scorsese's greatest achievement, "The Wolf of Wall Street" makes the race for No. 2 a lot more interesting.__As with Goodfellas, Scorsese's helpless attraction to the very behavior he wants to indict becomes the movie's serrated edge.__Scorsese has pulled off something tricky with Wolf: He's given us a thrilling cautionary tale about a guy who never for a second seems the slightest bit sorry for what he's done. If anything, he just had the bad luck to get caught.__DiCaprio doesn't seem terribly comfortable in the role despite all his strutting and posturing.__At the highest level, it really is about getting your own, forget those down below. If so, that could have easily come across in two hours, it didn't need three.__Why would a man cheat people out of millions and then spend it on hookers, 'ludes and stupid pranks? Hey, why wouldn't you?__As Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who spent years cheerfully defrauding investors, DiCaprio is positively reptilian; he spits out his lines with a nasty glee. You're both horrified and enchanted by this creature - a monster in Armani.__It's like "Goodfellas," only (slightly) more legal, which is very much the point.__Scorsese, as always, knows exactly what he is doing. Although it's long, the movie is never less than entertaining.__Various Cheech-and-Chong-style slapstick scenarios play out repeatedly, just with different props.__A vital and troubling document of the present ...__Scorsese presents Belfort as a charismatic Caligula. He is an endlessly fascinating character who holds viewers' attention from beginning to end.__"The Wolf of Wall Street" is a fleet-footed three hours of startling moments, 99 percent of them hedonistic and hilarious.
It's not an interpretation of actual history as much as it is a reduced revision of movie history.__The Butler proves a decent, significant, but slightly stodgy affair. Its dignified restraint stifles its anger.__A high-minded, didactic, but irresistible entertainment ...__Forest Whitaker imbues his part with immense dignity and the old-age makeup is effective showcasing Cecil during his later years.__[A] turbulent, emotionally overpowering movie.__Winfrey is good, though, demonstrating yet again that she's an actress and not just a celebrity playing an actress.__A history lesson in violence and endurance. A sentimental journey. A tribute. Director Daniels and the dedicated cast of The Butler deliver all that.__The Butler may be a sanctimonious cartoon, but it points to events in the civil rights struggle that were as grotesque and extraordinary as any fiction can invent.__"The Butler" mixes big issues and big people and real human life with surprising grace.__It's too obviously a careful tour through American history, and while some sequences work - particularly the various attacks on civil-rights workers - too much of it feels as flat and cheap as a film strip.__Forest Whitaker gives the performance of his career.__The director's sometimes absurd bravado-along with Forest Whitaker's grave, wise performance in the title role-is what gives this outsized and sometimes lumbering film its irrefutable emotional power.__"Lee Daniels' The Butler" might have been titled "Lee Daniels' Forrest Gump" - its hero challenged morally rather than mentally, but watching history in Gumpian fashion, as a series of cameos viewed through a slightly clueless daze.__The movie's a mess, but a unique and provocative one.__"The Butler" is a nice idea for a movie, but has a mostly silly script and some of the craziest and most laughable casting imaginable.__Remarkable not for its "Forrest Gump"-itude but for its unerring social portrait of a black middle class torn by the stress-fractures of an era.__Both deeply affecting and blatant Oscar bait.__Even at its worst, it prefers to stimulate rather than launch another noisy parade of stereotypes.__Packed with stunt casting and distracting performances.__The Butler is an inspiring and important summation of the black struggle.
This final installment in the party-boy franchise... wisely drops the narrative gimmick of alcohol-induced amnesia that made the first movie so unusual and the second its pallid copy.__An excessively violent action comedy that handily manages the tough task of feeling at once tired and aggressively heartless.__If only what happened in Vegas had stayed in Vegas.__This third installment could easily be dismissed as too little, too late, if only it weren't in fact too much, too late.__This odious, mean-spirited movie appropriates the title and the characters from the previous pictures and sends them on a would-be adventure involving gangsters, gold bars and that pinnacle of hilarity, decapitated giraffes.__Not just bad, but weirdly, fascinatingly bad.__"Hangover III" is likable enough, even as it collapses in a heap.__Coupled with its logic headaches, it left me feeling like I needed an Alka-Seltzer Plus. Anything to add a little fizzy relief to these flat and unfunny proceedings.__The Hangover Part III is an obvious example of how wrong things can go when the almighty dollar is allowed to rule what comes out of Hollywood.__The tonal problem of the second installment, which often resembled a drug-infested pulp thriller instead of a comedy, is also problematic here.__The pleasant surprise of "The Hangover Part III" is a belated bout of adulthood has only made the extended-adolescent characters funnier. The result is a more traditional but more hysterical crowd-pleaser.__Director Todd Phillips delivers a film so different from the first two, I'm not even sure it's supposed to be a comedy.__The first movie left you with an exhilarating rush. All that Part III leaves is, well, a hangover.__Those looking for hilarity and hijinks with episode three will find the party is indeed over.____The first "Hangover" was good dirty fun; the second was dirtier, and less fun. But the third? It's just a chore - and no hair of the dog is going to make it any easier to bear.__I'm not sure who let the dogs out this time, but they should be made to pay.__I had to wait until halfway through the closing credits for my first, and only, laugh.__There is ... no hangover in The Hangover Part III. And yet a sense of creative dehydration still pervades.__The Hangover Part III gives off such a stench of creative decay that it hardly seems possible that even Phillips or his co-writers have any use for the movie themselves.
For all its attempts at wonder and spectacle and play, Epic is mostly a slog.__Although the basic story is too juvenile and simplistic to entertain anyone with an age in the double-digit range, the themes and underlying ideas are too complicated to capture the attention of someone younger.__Director Chris Wedge falls into the common animator's trap of making the "human" characters a lot duller than the nonhuman creepy-crawlies.__With its array of goofy sidekicks (Aziz Ansari as a slug almost runs away with the whole picture) and carefully crafted relationships, Epic certainly manages to tell a compelling tale.__A 3D eco-fantasy whose mantra-like insistence that we're all connected by nature is one of the main things that underscores the abject insincerity of the sentiment as the movie articulates it, "Epic" is very nearly epic in its stifling mediocrity.__Anyone over the age of 7 or so - not to mention their accompanying adults - isn't going to find too much here to truly engage them, let alone linger past the final fade out.__Children may enjoy it, but even they will be able to see all the boxes it systematically ticks.__It may not be epic, but it's eye-popping entertainment.__[It] is certainly very pretty to look at, and has a general agreeability about it. But the movie would need to engage us far more powerfully for that hyperbolic title to fit.__Generic entertainment with a brave heroine, cutesy-poo supporting characters, parental figures who are either absent or absent-minded, etcetera, etcetera.__The emotional connection that should have the crowd cheering wildly for the heroes and booing the villains never clicks in.__As beautiful as it is, "Epic" is fatally lacking in visceral momentum and dramatic edge.__Epic's visuals are enthralling enough for little and big folks to offset a predictable, albeit sweet, story.__"Epic" may be the thinking family's best Saturday matinee of the summer. And the date movie of the season.__Epic? More like meh.__Even young would-be botanists will find this charmless animated adventure as exciting as watching grass grow.__In the roll call of visually distinctive 'toons, "Epic" looms large.__So generic it might as well come in a black-and-white box: Animated Adventure TBD.__With its secret, magical worlds and legions of evil-battling leafy warriors, there's plenty here to engage young audiences of both genders.__I had the sensation of sitting through a fourth-grade school play that contained no children of my own: the very definition of a nightmare.
Over and over in this movie we hear variations on the phrase "everything's going to be OK." It's just impossible to head out of the theater and back into the wider world believing that's actually true.__We're in the steady hands of Paul Greengrass, a director fully aware that convincing crisis stories involve conflicting interests and passions.__The entire performance is one of the greatest in Hanks' prolific, varied career - a role that gives him a massive arc and the opportunity to show great range.__Whether or not you find it an inadvertent parable of the political moment (I do), Captain Phillips is a terrific film.__It's the work of Tom Hanks that makes this film unforgettable.__This is acting of the highest order in a movie that raises the bar on what a true-life action thriller can do.__It's some of the most powerful acting Hanks has ever done.__This is one of the year's best movies and it features Tom Hanks' strongest work in more than a decade. But it's a live wire, time bomb of a film that, when it finally releases, leaves your nerves scrambled.__Captain Phillips manages to expose us to a few things that are unusual in a thriller, including sympathy for the enemy and, in Hanks's performance, the frailty that is the other side of heroism.__Captain Phillips puts names and faces to its tale of economic clashes. That's why Hanks' and Abdi's performances are so anchoring. Their characters face off, negotiate, cajole each other not as archetypes but as humans.__The drug-addled camera and ominous music might seem excessive in Phillips' home office, but like a noisy refrigerator or odd smell, the body learns to ignore what's jarring at first.__Hanks deftly captures Phillips' blend of bravery, heroism and abject terror in a wonderfully minimalist performance, one of his best.__No one working in movies today does fervid, visceral realism better than director Paul Greengrass.__Director Paul Greengrass' treatment of this material - and Tom Hanks' extraordinary performance - makes the movie required viewing for the informed and uninformed alike.__There's something so unforced about him that it can seem as if he's not delivering a performance, just being Tom Hanks.__Greengrass floods the moviegoer's eye with enormous amounts of assimilable detail. Those gifts are on offer here too, but in a scenario lacking in suspense.__The film succeeds on its own terms-an exciting entertainment that makes us feel good about the outcome, and about the reach of American power, rather than its limits.__Yet another Greengrass masterpiece. And it reveals why there have been so many: Behind the director's dispassionate, unfailingly rigorous lens lies an enormous, unfailingly compassionate heart.__Another highlight in Tom Hanks' Americana gallery, the story of a seemingly regular guy who turns out to be something more than a regular guy, thus giving hope to regular guys everywhere.__In addition to being an action-adventure about captors and hostages, Captain Phillips is a tragedy about the ruinous consequences of global capitalism.
The wrongs pile up, and there's a clear object of satire. That feels new for the Jackass experience: a target that isn't a crotch. I'd like to see Irv try to strike again with braver gags.__Onlookers occasionally glance into the camera, a pretty good sign that people are hip to these prankster movies now and just play along.__It's been 11 years since Jackass: The Movie, and three since Jackass 3D, although it feels a lot longer than that.__Like the lime-green bingo dabber contents Irving drinks down to the horror of his seatmates, it's an acquired taste.__It's not really a movie. It's Johnny Knoxville and his Jackass crew faking out real people into believing he's 86-year-old Irving Zisman, an old fart bag traveling cross-country.__Sometimes joy buzzers - and pratfalls, and funny costumes - are really all you need for a laugh or two. Or even a three-star comedy.__What impressed me again and again is how unflappably polite Americans can be.__For all its flaws, it might just be the most heartwarming movie of the year.__Apart from a handful of physical stunts and the penultimate biker-bar setup, Knoxville never puts himself at risk, and the imbalance of power curdles the imperative to laugh at the rubes.__You'll occasionally laugh out loud, but the heart of the movie is safe enough to chuckle at.__The film has a story complete with a beginning, middle and end. It has some acting and emotion. And most shocking of all - it has empathy.__It's hard to score big laughs with hidden-camera material these days because there has been so much of it since the "Jackass" TV show, but Mr. Knoxville and his young sidekick still land a few jaw-droppers.__This whole movie is pretty much a mental colon blow.__Not only stands as the best installment (by bounds) of Johnny Knoxville's hidden-camera franchise; it's one of the sharpest comedies of the year.__My contender for funniest movie of the year.__Though at times it grows predictable and more inane than outrageous, "Bad Grandpa" gets more than its share of cheap laughs.__Some of the pranks are masterfully executed; the beauty pageant and a disastrous funeral near the beginning stand out. But on the whole, "Bad Grandpa" can't locate a consistent groove.__Although we're allowed the perverse pleasure of watching Irving commit one inappropriate act after another, our sense of horror/delight dissipates after each one.__Knoxville and the perfectly cast Nicoll have great chemistry throughout. But longtime "Jackass" director Jeff Tremaine consistently cuts away too quickly, undermining each joke in order to rush on to the next.__The joke is really on Knoxville, who, despite flinging himself through a glass wall and rigging up a fake poo-sprayer in his pants, gets fewer laughs than his boy sidekick
Del Toro is a dreamer. He's a visionary. If you give him a pile of money to make enormous robots fight enormous monsters at the end of civilization, he will work to make Pacific Rim a movie that makes you feel all the enormousness.__It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered -- long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant.__A ridiculously entertaining (and often just plain ridiculous) monster-robot movie that plays like that "Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots" game from the 1960s.__Its visual achievements notwithstanding, Pacific Rim's greatest breakthrough may be that it's the first Hollywood blockbuster to sport a title less descriptive of its plot than of its intended market.__It's as if Del Toro neuro-linked with a robot and then couldn't figure out how to work the controls -- and so watched impotently as the machine made the major creative decisions.__All the unpredictability of professional wrestling plus the magic of synchronized Stairmasters -- that's what I got out of the vaunted spectacle of Pacific Rim.__There are long sequences in this movie that merit that most overused of terms: "Awesome."__The fights are well-staged and there's just enough interstitial humanity among boxing matches to keep things from getting monotonous.__Del Toro is reveling in blockbuster cliches at the same time he's pounding them into the pavement, and somehow that self-consciousness lets us all in on the joke.__After a long cycle of action movies in which the protagonists spend most of their downtime introspecting about their heroic obligations, Pacific Rim is something different: a heart-warming team-building exercise.__Monsters, robots, grand heroism and a few clever jokes: Sounds like a perfect Saturday afternoon to me.__Pacific Rim's ability to make monster-walloping feel fun again will no doubt make Atlantic Seaboard (or maybe Mediterranean Coastal Region) as inevitable a follow-up as the return of the Kaiju through that pesky underwater portal.__That humanistic touch is pure del Toro, and it makes all the difference in Pacific Rim, whose own whirring, glowing heart doesn't belong to any machine but to the director himself.__My head is still ringing, and hurting, from long stretches of this aliens vs. robots extravaganza that are no better than the worst brain-pounders of the genre.__Pacific Rim, thank the gods of cinema, is the work of a humanist ready to banish cynicism for compassion.__Pacific Rim looks great. It's one of the rare 3-D features that probably delivers more in the large-screen, stereoscopic format - severed Kaiju limbs, comin' at ya!__Inadvertently makes the case that extinction might not be so bad... If this is the best we can do in terms of movies - if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences - maybe we should just turn over the cameras to the alien dinosaurs__The movie is an eyeful, especially in 3-D, but even with humans at the helms of the machines, it's a hollow exercise in homage.__It lasts more than two hours. And there is nothing endearing about it.__Another marathon of cacophony and cliche.
There's wonder here that films with quadruple the effects budget would kill for.__The film is more guileful than it looks, even though the narrative is nuts ...__No comedy classic, then, but a good natured and engaging slice of goonish self-mockery.__... the movie definitely struck a chord with the crowd I saw it with ... (with) a climax that brings bromance back ...__This Is the End, true to its subject matter, is as funny as hell.__Crass, flimsily plotted, and self-referential to the point of narcissistic personality disorder. For those willing to tolerate such defects, however, it is also very, very funny.__The filmmaking itself is disarmingly amusing, hitting grace notes amid the grandiosity.__Though This Is the End drags slightly here and there, the filmmakers keep it interesting by making the personal relationships dynamic, and the movie redeems all that is self-referential and self-congratulatory about it with a warmth of spirit.__Their big joke is to literalize the Book of Revelations, but snaking around this is a biting contempt for the entertainment business, their own bad movies, and the social privilege these confer.__This Is the End is the bust-out, badass comedy of the summer. And then some. It's so good you'll think you hallucinated it.__Funny is funny, and it would be truly dishonest to deny the big laughs-the spikes of gut-busting inspiration-that the film sporadically delivers.__As long as Rogen and his buddies are just as self-involved, crude, obnoxious and hopefully exaggerated versions of themselves, things stay pretty funny.__"This is the End" finds a balanced tone most horror comedies fail to deliver. Grossout humor melds easily with grossout horror, sometimes at the same moment.__"This is one of the most tasteless, ridiculous and funniest comedies of the 21st century."__Most of the celebrities playing things straight (Michael Cera is a notable exception, portrayed as a cokehead sex addict who likes blowing cocaine into people's faces without warning).__As both homage and send-up, it presents viewers with the ultra-meta image of a comedy genre eating its own tail.__It is intensely raunchy and silly and joyous and tapped right into my inner teenager in a glorious way.__Out-of-control hilarious.__Six comedians stuck in a house together as the world is ending. What could be funnier than that?__[A] crass, patchy, occasionally hilarious farce ...
Olympus Has Fallen is made from action-movie mix. Just add sweat.__The thrills and the effects are cheap, but this is in hard-driving, good-humoured command of its own silliness.__This ludicrous actioner strives to be as loud, violent, and patriotic as possible.__Fuqua doesn't deliver on what he has set up.__The carnage is cruel and crude.__A typical slab of Hollywood action in which the White House crumbles under attack, the American flag is tattered and tossed aside by baddies, and cliches rise like gods.__'Olympus Has Fallen is just too much of a pale 'Die Hard' ripoff.__... the action is often not unengaging, and Butler's better at swinging for faux Bruce Willis ...__Given the premise's essential absurdity, it's almost embarrassingly entertaining.__"Olympus Has Fallen" goes through plenty of familiar motions, but does them well enough that it gets away with it. There's a reason movies like this die hard.__The film is a second-rate "Air Force One" mashed up with a third-rate "Die Hard," with Gerard Butler striving mightily to be charismatic as the One Man Who Can Save the Day.__"Olympus Has Fallen" at least possesses the frisson of timeliness amid otherwise hoary action-movie cliches.__It's a solid, simple, more-bang-for-our-buck entertainment that doesn't ask us to think.__A nitwit extravaganza that makes you long for the intellectual depth of Independence Day.__It has to be a joke, right?__"Olympus Has Fallen" is everything an audience nostalgic for the Steven Seagal killfests of the '90s expects and deserves.__Sadly, Mr. Butler lacks the wit and the range to convey anything other than grouchy belligerence, and the script, by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt, seems intent on squandering opportunities to be clever or interesting.__This is for those who like their political thrillers far-fetched, far-reaching and filled with pretty people.__While Gerard Butler is no Bruce Willis, his Mike Banning is a better facsimile of John McClane than the guy Willis is pretending to play these days.__"Olympus" has a strictly director-for-hire vibe; anyone with access to a Roland Emmerich movie or two (namely "Independence Day") and a mad-libbed action script could have churned out something similar.
A dramatization of what Robinson did and what it required, 42 will not disappoint.__It's not easy to play a stoic, but Boseman anchors the movie, and when he smiles, 42, already such a warm story of such cold times, gets even brighter.__The style of the film, lush and traditional, is nothing special, but the takeaway, a daily struggle for dignity, is impossibly moving.__So 66 years after Robinson became the first black major league baseball player, here we are with 42, which has been made with such reverence for Robinson's importance that Robinson is barely there.__A square, uninventive, but detailed and stirring bio-pic devoted to the two years in an athlete's life that changed a nation.__"This is a competent but mostly unexceptional film about a most extraordinary man."__This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history.__The filmmaking is TV-movie-of-the-week dull and Robinson's ordeal is hammered home to the exclusion of virtually everything else in his life.__"A kind and decent film, though it doesn't add to Robinson's legacy."__[Boseman] captures, in a clenched jaw or a sidelong glance, a lifetime's worth of dearly attained dignity and barely contained rage.__In the hallowed frames of 42, the legend is front and centre and still inspiring. Too bad the more interesting man is nowhere to be seen.__If anybody deserves to be portrayed as noble, it's Jackie Robinson.__An inspiring, old-school biopic that doesn't pull any punches in depicting the ugly racism that Jackie Robinson faced on a daily basis as the first African-American player in Major League Baseball.__A stirring, straightforward and ultimately soaring portrayal of Robinson's historic entry into Major League Baseball in 1947.__The beauty of the Jackie Robinson story is that it's so naturally inspiring that not even lethal amounts of bombast, sentimental writing, soaring strings, hammy acting or desperate hyperbole can tarnish it beyond repair.__By burnishing Jackie Robinson's legend to such an unnaturally high polish, 42 does Robinson the man (and the actor who plays him, the relative newcomer Chadwick Boseman) a disservice.__Robinson's story had so much drama in real life, and his sacrifice and pain made such a lasting influence, that "42" ends up being effective in its gee-whiz way almost in spite of itself.__For all the 1940s hokiness of 42, with its big cars and big bands and peanuts and Cracker Jack, it's a wonderful surprise to see that there's a recognizable human being at the center of the hoopla.__42 escapes the trappings of sheer hero worship largely thanks to Boseman, whose relative anonymity eliminates any potential star baggage. More than that, he strikes a tough balance.__Mr. Helgeland's ponderously reverential biopic is a string of unearned runs.
Any thematic audacity is snuffed out by action sequences that you can now buy at Dollar General.__Like Max, the movie has to keep moving, and Mr. Blomkamp lets you fill in the gaps yourself as it progresses. Or not.__Though Elysium is a testament to Blomkamp's extraordinary skill as a visual filmmaker, it does not speak nearly so well for his gifts as a writer.__The action is bludgeoning.__A cautionary tale about the dangers of squandering resources that wastes its own talent.__If Elysium is an example of how recession-era Hollywood intends to dramatize the rift between the haves and the have-nots, let's hope the studios don't also bring back Smell-O-Rama.__An epic about saving humanity that feels more manufactured than human.__It's like one of those bad "Star Trek" episodes, when Gene Roddenberry stopped everything on the bridge so he could lecture us about the Cold War.__This is one of the better action films of the year.__Although the pulp energy that Blomkamp brings to this material makes it consistently watchable, the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped.__Few mainstream moviemakers have painted as sprawling and densely detailed a portrait of humanity in extremis as Blomkamp does here.__Does a little, sometimes shockingly little, with a lot.__Among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-handbasket spectacles, Elysium takes the cake.__Makes clear that Blomkamp is a genuine visionary who's trying to push the envelope of possibility in mainstream popcorn cinema.__The movie's blue-collar aesthetic, impressive in its vision and kinetics, lacks emotional variety and humor.__Damon's presence greatly alleviates the been-there feel of this Elysium excursion, which starts to run out of steam when the usual explosive heroics kick in.__The movie is both sloppy in its details and too literal in its thinking. A less blunt allegory might have made for sharper entertainment.__Director/writer [Neill] Blomkamp has tossed adie any sense of subtlety for a heavy-handed reprise of some of District 9's  basic themes hog-tied to a riff on undocumented immigration.__Mr. Damon brings both a weary optimism and convincing physicality to Max, who is no revolutionary. He just wants to live, and is willing to don an exoskeletal combat suit and fight robots to do it.__Blomkamp's admirable if obvious egalitarianism too often devolves into simplistic wish-fulfillment. Still, his formidable visual imagination is on full display.
An endearing enough David-and-Goliath tale, aimed squarely at younger kids.__A visually colorful but otherwise vanilla continuation of the series.__Strictly by the numbers, from the believe-in-yourself moral to the purely predictable ending.__Has the look and feel of Pixar's 2006 hit, "Cars," if not the latter's charm or strong story.__"Planes" is for the most part content to imitate rather than innovate, presumably hoping to reap a respectable fraction of the box office numbers of "Cars" and "Cars 2," which together made hundreds of millions of dollars.__As with "Cars," the world of "Planes" feels safe. A little too safe, perhaps.__It's engaging enough, driving home the familiar message of following one's dreams and the less hackneyed theme of facing one's fears. But it feels far too familiar__A zippy little programmer designed to exploit the same vehicles-as-people formula as the Cars franchise.__While the plotting is rather pedestrian, the humour mostly lame, what makes Planes a stand-out experience - not surprisingly, based on Disney's vast and impressive history of animated classics - is the visuals.__A charmingly modest low-budget spin-off from Pixar's "Cars'' that provides more thrills and laughs for young children and their parents than many of its more elaborate brethren.__If "Planes" were a reasonably priced download, you'd gladly use it to sedate your kids during a long car ride. As a theatrical, 3-D release, however, "Planes" will sedate you, too.__This film is 100 percent devoid of surprises. It's the story of an underestimated underdog that's like every other kid-friendly, life-coachy story about an underestimated underdog.__Has all the hallmarks of a straight-to-DVD project - inferior plot, dull writing, cheap drawing - perhaps because it was intended for the bargain bin at Target, Walmart, and Costco.__Seems ... like a lesser version of what may be Pixar's two weakest efforts, the "Cars" movies.__It's not terrible, but it still feels like a waste.__"Planes" was originally scheduled to be released straight to video. Although the smallest children might like bits and pieces of it, there's nothing in the movie that suggests why Disney strayed from its original plan.__Many will enter theaters thinking this is a Pixar film, with the raised expectations that accompany that mistake. But even cynical animation fans will see there's quality here. After a little turbulence, "Planes" comes in for a nice landing.__"Cars," with planes. And some cars. And a truck or two.__The jokes in "Planes" are runway flat, and parents will likely reach for the air-sickness bag.__It's the cinematic equivalent of those Chinese knockoff luxury sedans.
This isn't the complete disaster of Wild Wild West, but that's only because none of the $250 million was spent to turn Kenneth Branagh into a mechanical spider.__Frustrating, lazy and lifeless.__Your expectations of how bad The Lone Ranger is can't trump the reality.____Somewhere, around the hour-and-a-half mark, The Lone Ranger makes the fateful decision not to end. Worse, the movie keeps not-ending for another full hour.__When it comes to mining boys' adventure stories, defaming pirates may be fair game, but stories about western justice and native Americans? Not so much.__Who, exactly, was this bipolar oater made for?__Director Gore Verbinski has adopted the more-is-better approach he used in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, crowding the movie with so many extraneous characters and subplots that the film becomes an endurance test.__A wild, wacky, wide-screen reimagining of the vintage radio serial and TV series, the film - with Armie Hammer in the hat and mask, galloping across Texas righting wrongs, and Depp as his trusty Indian sidekick, Tonto - is an epic good time.__I mean, no wonder Depp's in disguise. No wonder Hammer wears a mask. Wouldn't you?__"The Lone Ranger" is a pounding headache of a movie - loud, dumb, overlong and pointless.__The real problem with the new "Lone Ranger" is that, for those who are familiar with the multibillion-dollar "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise, there is little fresh or exciting about what we have here.__Shot mostly across scenic landscapes in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, including Monument Valley, [it acts] as a visual tribute to some of the great Westerns of history shot by the likes of John Ford. This Lone Ranger won't be joining their ranks.__If anything, it's overstuffed with imagination and ideas, and when it comes to Hollywood movies I very much prefer that to the default setting. See it with an open mind, and you may well be surprised.__A stone-faced Depp fails to generate even the stinky charm of his mascaraed Jack Sparrow, and in fact almost everyone here comes off badly.__Despite its impressively staged set pieces, The Lone Ranger can't survive the epic train wreck resulting from its own tonal clashes, wherein mournful scenes of genocide and stolen immigrant labor are tastelessly juxtaposed with silly slapstick humor.__The sort of movie that delivers too much too late and still manages to make it feel like too little.__Except for the dynamite finale, "The Long Ranger" feels like a long, slow ride to the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump, dump.__In trying to balance grandiosity with playfulness, to lampoon cowboy-and-Indian cliches while taking somber account of a history of violence, greed and exploitation, it descends into nerve-racking incoherence.__The Lone Ranger is too often as vast and empty as Utah's Monument Valley. Only the film's wide stretches aren't awe-inspiring so much as much as tiring.
Although it looks spectacular and boasts some pungent ideas, the surprise-to-running-time ratio is out of whack.__It takes more than an hour for Oblivion to become whatever it is the filmmakers think it's supposed to be.__In space, Jack hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn.__Feels ever more grounded and stuck ...__Was Cruise trying to beat out fellow Scientologist John Travolta for the honor of starring in the dumbest sci-fi epic ever?__If nothing else, "Oblivion" will go down in film history as the movie where Tom Cruise pilots a white, sperm-shaped craft into a giant space uterus.__This is the sci-fi movie equivalent of a pretty damn good cover band.__Glossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered.__The story eventually devolves into a grab bag of sci-fi tropes but, as with so many other Cruise productions, the sheer scale of everything is so mind-numbing that you may not notice.__The sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me - and many other people, I suspect - to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski.__Oblivion is an okay blockbuster, a multimillion-dollar exercise in competence.__Kosinski offers plenty of action here, and he lets the plot reveals bleed out slowly (explanations keep coming right to the end). Yes, a great deal is derivative, but it's fast-moving derivative.__A movie that combines a lot of different films, yet somehow remains less than the sum of its parts ...__More adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole, "Oblivion" makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didn't let you go.__If you're able to forgive and forget, Oblivion isn't a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again.__Director Joseph Kosinski focuses on cool visuals but stints on a compelling plot. It's a dazzler, but the story lacks the impact of the futuristic look.__The mystery posed by "Oblivion" as a whole is why its mysteries are posed so clumsily, and worked out so murkily.__The agony of being a longtime Tom Cruise fan has always been a burden, but now it's just, well, dispiriting.__[Cruise] oversees some pretty impressive stuff here, from the drones that ping-pong around in the air to the bubbleship that Jack uses to go to and fro to that awesome house with its panoramic views.__Kosinski's personal commitment to gorgeous artifice above all other considerations only harms the film so much.
The whole thing leaves you with an appalling chill. It feels like a warning from Hollywood to the ambivalent creators of anything: Take the spoonful of sugar or we'll force-feed it to you.__Pencil Thompson in now for an Oscar nomination, and maybe a win, and prepare to leave the theater humming the iconic songs.__The sap doesn't run too thick, although it does run, and the movie certainly has a patented Disney upbeat feel much of the time. It's more a spoonful of sugar than medicine for aging baby boomer's souls.__Smart, delightful.__Saving Mr Banks is a merciless film. It hits you with every sentimental low blow it can think of. Then it pounds you again. And when you're down, it jumps on you.__"Saving Mr. Banks" is a shameless wad of corporate PR, a feel-good, self-serving Disney film about the making of a Disney film.__The movie avoids commonplace traps; it never becomes maudlin and it doesn't transform Travers into a likeable elderly lady whose heart of gold is camouflaged by crotchetiness.__Beneath Banks' crass self-aggrandizement lies a pretty charming portrait of two overly proud people butting creative heads. Yes, charming. That's what Disney does, and it does it well enough to turn even this condescending pap into something palatable.__Most people will come away from Saving Mr. Banks feeling like they just sat through a feature-length ad for the magic of Walt Disney, with P.L. Travers' life tacked on as an afterthought.__A good movie, buoyed by good performances from Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks and, almost as an afterthought, an especially affecting Colin Farrell.__The screenplay, by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, seamlessly captures two different eras with overlapping story lines that never intrude or confuse.__This film works as its own lovingly rendered story.__Just as Mary rescued the wilting Banks family, so Thompson saves the film. A spoonful of her medicine makes the sugar go down.__For a movie that's all about what a swell idea it was to adapt Mary Poppins for the screen, Saving Mr. Banks seems remarkably uninterested in what made the movie special.__Thompson is very good at playing imperious, and she even manages an unexpected trace of flirtiness in a few offhanded moments with Hanks.__I found it interminable.__The picture finally succeeds as the kind of fantasy that its two main characters consorted in, individually and, on one project, together.__A desperately Oscar-hungry contrivance whose only hope lies with the terrific Thompson.__"Saving Mr. Banks" wraps a seduction inside a seduction with enjoyable results. It's a Disney film in every sense of the term.__Nobody plays huffy like Thompson, who seems to sniff with her entire body; she's wonderfully funny against Hanks' effusive Disney.
Kids should be game for the ride, and the colourful characters offer humour and poignancy.__After the originality of the hero, the filmmakers borrow too heavily from other movies; the similarities to "Ratatouille" and "Cars" are almost distracting.__the movie seems to understand its own near-abject ridiculousness ... without getting overly nudge-nudge wink-wink ...__[An] energetic, funny cartoon about a plucky garden snail.__"Turbo" isn't a perfect cartoon, but it's so likable that, like its humble hero, you have to root for it.__A derivative but nevertheless good-hearted movie that's peppered with enough clever touches to engage adults as well as moviegoers of the smaller, squirmier variety.__A sort-of escargot-meets-"Cars" adventure, it has some sharp vocal turns and remains fun even when its inventiveness runs out of gas.__Turbo won't set the world of animation on fire, but it's a fun movie.__Ultimately, "Turbo" nicely lives up to its diminutive hero's credo of, "No dream is too big, and no dreamer too small" - a pleasant thought, for people of all sizes.__Let's face it: Kids aren't a very demanding audience. If there's color, movement, and a high quotient of silliness, they're happy.__DreamWorks' 3-D confection ... featuring Ryan Reynolds as a garden-trolling slowpoke who dreams of Indianapolis 500 glory.__Turbo's colourful trek to product placement-littered Indianapolis is as rote as it gets, but little viewers won't care about predictability.__Honestly, they pretty much had me at "racing snails."__Great voice talent in a story that puts the "go" in escargot.__Even in the absence of originality, there is fun to be had, thanks to some loopy, clever jokes (the script is by Darren Lemke, Robert Siegel and David Soren, who directed) and a lively celebrity voice cast ...__Has some appealing characters, a few laughs and then devolves into a predictable Tortoise and the Hare spinoff.__"Turbo" has just enough heart to make it to the winner's circle.__An easy recommendation, well-considered and well-executed, a treat for anyone who likes comedy or ambitious takes on make-believe worlds.__Content to be merely cheerfully cliched, it's an assembly-line kids' film that, unlike its daring protagonist, risks little, and thus reaps only modest rewards.__A fresh, fast and funny little fable about a freakishly fast garden snail who tries to enter the Indy 500.
Washington and Wahlberg have a good time robbing banks and blowing up buildings and barreling through military security checkpoints and double-crossing people and shooting each other because none of it really means anything.__That a movie this fleet and lean succumbs to action-blockbuster bloat in the home stretch is both disappointing and predictable, although the director deserves credit for keeping the climactic shootouts slick and spatially coherent.__Mark Wahlberg reunites with Contraband director Baltasar Kormakur for an action movie that's even more cynical and sadistic than its predecessor.__In this star vehicle for Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, the headlights are on full beam but the engine is struggling in second gear.__Beyond ridiculous but always entertaining. Washington and Wahlberg are terrific.__The biggest guns this action flick brandishes are stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg who have very different acting styles that work surprisingly well together.__It's essentially a buddy-cop romp with the usual assortment pack of graphic gruesomeness.__An unremarkable, standard-issue shoot-em-up that rests entirely on the charisma of its two stars.__Banter, banter, banter. It's such fun being a tough guy and killing people.__In a summer when so many of the hype-heavy movies turned out to be big-budget bores, it's refreshing when a movie like 2 Guns achieves its admittedly modest ambitions.__2 Guns slops over with instantly over-familiar ingredients like bantering criminal and/or crime-fighting buddies, a loathsome Mexican drug lord, and a femme vitale and femme fatale rolled into one comely dame.__Though individual set pieces are well done, the film inevitably leaves an empty taste behind it once it's done.__2 Guns loses its charm amid multiple incidents of torture and brutality, including animal cruelty ...__Just go ahead and assume that everybody is trying to kill everybody and you'll be relatively clear.__Thousands of rounds of ammo are spent in 2 Guns, a brutal, complicated and sporadically funny movie that still seems slight.__Fast pacing and a high energy level can cover a lot of sins, and nowhere is that more evident than in 2 Guns.__A slick, slippery thriller that taps into the anarchic playfulness that made the best American action flicks of the 1980s and '90s pop.__With the combined heat of its stars, "2 Guns" should have had double impact, but Washington and Wahlberg are only doing this tango for cash.__"2 Guns" feels like it's all been done before, whether by John Woo, Michael Bay or any number of their CGI-happy clones.__What's the old expression about putting lipstick on a pig? "2 Guns," a busy and bullet-riddled new action movie, has some mighty fine lipstick, but it's still a porker.
White House Down is terrible. The acting? The effects? The villainy? All bad. The politics are a hot mess.__If all you're after is a pair of mismatched heroes wisecracking their way through a series of explosive, well-mounted set pieces, look no further.__It's Independence Day without the aliens and a president partial to Air Jordans.__The main flaw of White House Down is that it overstays its welcome, thanks in large part to a silly climax that seems to unfold in three laborious acts.__Essentially a louder, sillier version of Die Hard, with John Cale standing in for John McClane, a precocious daughter standing in for the plucky wife, and, alas, no one even much trying to stand in for Alan Rickman's deliciously wicked Hans Gruber.__It follows the Emmerich template: a spectacle-tinged, compelling setup; a dumb, disappointing midsection; and a cheese-topped denouement that veers so close to self-parody that one is tempted to call it funny.__Formula action films don't come much more formulaic that this.__Emmerich isn't strenuous about setting a consistent tone. Action movie blow-ups are interlaced with dumb jokes and slapstick. He's an anything-for-effect guy, but some of his effects are none too effective.__Emmerich is an old hand at blowing up the White House and finds new wings as well as other national monuments to destroy: They blow up real good.__In this season of solemnly manly blockbusters, I appreciated the boyish energy of White House Down, a movie that, for all its flamboyant destructiveness, has a playful innocence at its core.__'White House Down' is, at certain moments, a good time in spite of itself. I, for one, was certainly glad when it was over.__Wonderfully orchestrated, mindless, summer-action fun.__It's the Die-Hard-in-the-White-House scenes that are the real stars - tightly framed and quickly paced scenes of mayhem, murder and hand-to-hand combat as an on-his-own Tatum tries to save the day.__In Emmerich's universe, no one ever went broke underestimating the world's desire to see things go boom.__The essential climate of the movie - the climate of hysteria, dysfunction and mendacity, backed up by an enduring, essentially optimistic and arguably idiotic culture of popular patriotism ... feels strikingly authentic to our historical moment.__White House Down is the kind of celebration of rampant mayhem in which everyone seems to have a rocket launcher -- or at least a live hand grenade -- at the ready, just in case they need to dispatch a scrum of exceptionally vile and cruel villains.__It's a blatant attempt for the director to revive his box office fortunes by blowing up parts of the White House Complex as gaudily as he did 18 years ago.__As demented and entertaining as promised, and a little less idiotic than feared.__White House Down has exactly what you'd expect from [Emmerich] and from the genre, only louder and dumber.__"White House Down" is solidly within its genre. In a deeper sense, though, it bespeaks a fatigue that's hard to distinguish from brain death.
The problem is that [the] movie barely meets the minimum generic requirements, and thus comes off as pretentious for presuming to hover so airily above them.__[The movie] has more integrity than its creepshow peers. The story basically comes down to a dead-looking woman who doesn't want to be a mother fighting for parental custody against a long-dead woman who does. (Grad students, start your theses.)__By splitting the action between several different characters and locations, the plot dissipates the suspense and lacks focus, as if it has been bolted together from disparate, ill-fitting pieces.__Screenplay contrivances aside, it's as stylish and atmospheric as modern horror gets.__Even if the beats are familiar, Muschietti sustains a remarkable mood throughout: wintry, elemental and stark, like a late Sylvia Plath poem.__I was guessing right till the bitter, scary, transcendent end.__It starts out strongly, using evocative visuals and an unsettling backstory to establish a creepy tableau, but it proves unable to sustain those strengths all the way to the finish line.__Is this Chastain's reputation-besmirching Norbit? Pshaw -- for my money, it's her best performance yet.__The metaphorical mother-child connection becomes a mystical horror show of significant power. Sadly it comes too late to save "Mama."__It's an interesting effort ... although, sadly, in the end "effort" is really the crucial word.__There's something eerily effective about juxtaposing childhood innocence with the violent, the supernatural, the deranged. Evil shines all the more brightly when held up against the sweet promise of youth.__Chastain has an excellent time. And so did I, for most of the movie: It's much more suspenseful than violent, being careful not to allow us to figure out Mama too quickly.__There's something dead and rotting at the center of "Mama," and it isn't the ghost of the woman who lends the horror film its title.__[A] respectable entry into the horror genre that values chills over kills.__"Mama" is skillfully made, and although Chastain is the best thing in it, she's not the only thing in it.__This is a picture about how a mother's love can be nourishing at its best but suffocating in the extreme. Chastain embraces that idea wholly, without squeezing the life out of it.__The fact that Guillermo del Toro is an executive producer of Mama is a tip-off that this won't be just another horror film with misbehaving and soon-to-be-dismembered teenagers or a drooling, slime-soaked monster.__More effective than you might expect.__Instead of delivering buckets of guts and gore, this ghost story offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don't often figure into horror flicks ...__"Mama" announces the arrival of a director who works unusually well with actors-the two children are truly scary-and who creates highly charged environments, effective sound designs and powerful fantasy sequences.
A movie whose punch line is so delightfully absurd that even after you pretty much know what's coming you spit out your Pepsi anyway.__Keeping up with the movie's inane plot twists makes for a capricious good time, but an unimaginative denouement turns the whole thing into a fool's errand.__[The] final reel ... descends into the Vortex of Bonkers, delivering fits of unexpected laughter.__Plods along with dialogue just above the level of crayon scribblings, and the direction by the usually reliable Lasse Hallstrom is dismayingly sluggish.__Their love story has a mellow ease -- as neither of them has much of a personality, we're just watching two swell people decide to bone__It's as though the filmmakers lacked the confidence to stick with the basic story, which served every element needed in a Sparks-infused guilty pleasure.__We genuinely like watching Hough and Duhamel circling around one another, and the movie has a nice sense of place. That all eventually vanishes with a doozy of a third act.__On its own merits, Safe Haven is about as satisfying and filling as a Valentine's Day conversation heart, with far less to say.__The latest Nicholas Sparks-derived weepfest, Safe Haven, is being marketed as a Valentine's Day special, but the plot line is closer to a stalker thriller. It's sudsy-scary. It's also not very good.__Hough doesn't stand a chance against shoddy pacing, horrific editing, and plot direction disastrous enough to make your toes curl.__Hough emits all the charisma of a personal assistant ...__I hate Safe Haven. It's a terrible thing to do to your Valentine.__Why make a movie when making a Hallmark-card-with-dialogue is so much less risky?__Apologies to Hallstrom, but an adaptation of a Sparks novel always ends up being a Sparks movie.__Lasse Hallstrom's new film does exactly what an adaptation should: It turns the original material's greatest flaws into assets.__The problem with the romantic "Safe Haven" isn't that it plays it safe, but that it plays it cheap. It's also about 10 minutes too long. And there's a final twist that, well, if you have any popcorn left by the scene, you'll want to throw it at the screen.__Like its equally weepy predecessors, it's a pretty-looking, wonderfully facile bit of emotional froth that's likely to clean up at the box office.__"Safe Haven" is one of those Valentine's Day confections that satisfy your sweet tooth until you get to their weird, off-putting center.__There's some theoretical appeal to the story of two emotionally damaged people learning to love again -- "theoretical" because the film needs better actors than Hough and Duhamel, and richer conversation than a shared enthusiasm for kale.__The best thing that can be said about "Safe Haven" is there is a cute romance in there somewhere.
Yes, this is the point in the summer when I outsource my critical judgment to my kids.__"The Smurfs 2" probably isn't any worse than you might expect. On the other hand, it's almost certainly not any better.__Not so much of a film as it is a collection of images and sounds that bludgeon you.__It would be too much to say that there's a good movie somewhere inside Smurfs 2 looking to get out. But it wouldn't be too much to say that sometimes, the movie we do have tries harder than we might expect.__The trouble with this stunted sequel is that the doughy, blobby-hatted Smurfs are mostly window dressing for an abrasive slapstick bash built around a tiresome kidnap plot ...__Only adults with 'Smurf-holm syndrome' could love this film.__There's a dark and gratuitously negative vibe to "The Smurfs 2" that makes it unfit even for the undiscriminating young moviegoers that made the first one a hit.__I found "The Smurfs 2" to be more enjoyable and far less obnoxious than [the original]. This, of course, is like saying having a cavity filled is preferable to a root canal, but in the dog days of the summer blockbuster season, beggars can't be smurfers.__What is it with the Smurfs? Why do people like them? Why have people always liked them?__Voicing Papa Smurf here turned out, alas, to be comedian Jonathan Winters' final role. (A crueler fate than Orson Welles signing off with 1986's animated "The Transformers: The Movie"? You be the judge.)__This insipid, and sometimes awkward, blend of animation, computer generation and live action wastes a ton of talent and lacks a true sense of whimsy.__It's not exactly "Ratatouille," but this quasi-animated movie makes an amusing late-summer vacation from superheroes and shoot-'em-ups.__Right down to the brute functionality of its title, "The Smurfs 2" may be the platonic ideal of a major studio sequel - no markedly better or worse than the first and with just enough difference to lay claim to being something new.__A new, not very engaging movie featuring a lot of blue skin and household-name voices.__They're as lethally uninteresting as Barney the Purple Dinosaur, though a Godzilla-style "Barney vs. Smurfs" is a movie I would pay to see, provided maximum destruction were promised.__The Smurfs 2 has everything you hated about the first movie, and more.__Smurfs 2 is at least slightly superior to the absolutely dire first film, but it remains a series for kids whose parents can't just pop in a DVD of something better.__That the mushroom- dwelling blue creatures still manage to be endearing even in their second big-screen extravaganza (in 3-D, no less) is about the best that can be said of "Smurfs 2."__Even movies aimed at very small children don't have to be painful for adults to sit through, and the good ones even have a few pleasures for them, as well.__Not Smurftastic, but not Smurfawful, either.
You leave emotionally exhausted, but there's a lot of care in this movie.__The Best Man Holiday is an inelegant movie, but its cast is so damn likable that we're still willing to follow them - even when they're not going anywhere.__A movie that does to your emotions exactly what one player does to another on the big Christmas game day: slams them to the ground and stomps them silly.__Even if some of the crudeness and the drama feel forced, it's hard to hate.__"The Best Man Holiday" gives holidays a bad name.__The mix of raunchy sex comedy and Christian faith doesn't quite come off.__Though not so warm and fuzzy as some fans may expect, "The Best Man Holiday" is a more than fitting return that improves upon the original in unexpected ways.__The people in "The Best Man Holiday" - not just the actors, but the characters they play - deserved a better script than this.__Only a few charming tidbits are nestled snugly in this over-stuffed Christmas stocking.__The problem is that it doesn't aim particularly high and, when the tears have dried and the cheers have subsided, there's a sense that what the movie offers is disappointingly ephemeral.__"The Best Man Holiday" possesses all the strengths and weaknesses of banal, high-gloss mainstream entertainment: It's boringly, bracingly, gratifyingly conventional. No shame in that game.__Pure drivel.__Luckily there's a lot to keep us entertained before things take a turn for the worse.__The cast is great fun, each getting his or her own moment to shine.__The Best Man Holiday is akin to getting a massive, gorgeously wrapped Christmas present and opening it to find a pair of socks.__The sequel to a deft romantic ensemble hit tries too hard to add heartbreak, uplift and religious, family values messages to the comedy-drama.__The film does feel overlong and the tone is occasionally wobbly. But Lee keeps the pace generally steady, mixing comedy and melodrama in even amounts.__The hangout factor with this cast is considerable. And the movie, while nothing visually special, earns its queen-sized dose of pathos honestly.__The conclusions are familiar -- friendship provides support, death makes squabbles seem petty, what's past is past -- but far from meaningless.__The actors play their characters with such depth of feeling that they make even the most cliched and hokum-drenched situations resonate with unexpected levels of emotional authenticity.
Whiny, listless and repetitive.__Precious little about this is particularly memorable, but it's the odd touch of local color that makes these routine acts of derring-do a bit easier to bear.__There are plenty of bad films to get riled up about in the summer. "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters" isn't one of them. This is harmless tween-centric fun.__Even for those missing their Harry Potter fix, this is some weak, watered-down stuff.__Yes, this is the point in the summer when I outsource my critical judgment to my kids.__You might think it would be endlessly awesome being the offspring of an Olympian god, but it seems like kind of a drag, really, for young Percy Jackson.__In Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, choosing the dumbest character is a colossal task.__Tweens and young teens should be sufficiently distracted by the movie's brisk pace and heroic mayhem - if they're not too unnerved by its at times nightmarish imagery.__Before it descends into Percy Jackson and the Things That Happen in Movies Like This, the adventure at times clicks into the inventive groove of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson novels ...__With its broad humour and less than serious tone, it's clearly aimed at tween and teen set and it's likely to be a crowd-pleaser among that demographic.__Characters don't so much have conversations as read Dungeons & Dragons manuals at each other. The whole thing feels like exposition in search of a story.__The movie feels like a watch-the-bottom-line effort that's determined to skimp on everything - guest stars, effects, spectacle - while bringing in new characters we don't care about.__This film hits its stride in a way the first one never did.__Obviously the bar isn't set that high, but Percy still manages to fumble underneath it.__With the young wizards of "Harry Potter" fading from memory, the demigod teenagers of "Percy Jackson" are starting to seem like the next best thing.__It's a shame that the millions of readers who fell in love with Riordan's classic-meets-contemporary children's stories have been handed such limp adaptations of the material.__Percy is a lot like a certain bespectacled young wizard - sans the lightning-shaped scar. It's too bad his adventures don't have the same enchanting quality.__A fetching mix of whizz-bang CGI and full-blooded classical storytelling.__"Sea of Monsters" is diverting enough - the director, Thor Freudenthal, is savvy with effects and keeps his young cast on point - but it doesn't begin to approach the biting adolescent tension of the Harry Potter movies__An epic showcase for mediocre CGI and slapdash screenwriting.
This is the fifth and least of the Die Hard movies.__What a disappointment.__I didn't think it was physically possible to doze off at a movie as loud as A Good Day to Die Hard, but for a few moments my mind found some distant, peaceful refuge.__It's all more than a little silly, but Willis' presence at least provides undercurrents of easy jocularity.__For anyone who remembers the "Die Hard" adventures at their vital and exciting best, this film feels like a near-death experience.__Few fans of the series would disagree that this sclerotic fifth installment should probably be the last.__This is the Magpie School of action filmmaking: Anytime things start to make so little sense that you might lose the audience, just throw something shiny up on screen to distract.__John's appeal was always his ordinariness, but director John Moore has him surviving more explosions than Wile E. Coyote, and with hardly a scratch.__An explosive, high-capacity-clip letdown.__I guess the people making A Good Day to Die Hard don't understand that mortality is one of John McClane's most endearing qualities. Turning him into a cyborg with a sense of self-deprecating humor makes this a low point in the series' history.__All Die Hard movies lack sense -- that's a given. This one lacks personality. And that's unforgivable.__Unnecessary but not unwatchable, this maintains a brisk pace as it moves through the familiar action set pieces, most of them decently orchestrated.__If there's something crassly opportunistic about exploiting a real life disaster on the scale of Chernobyl for cheap thrills, that's part and parcel of the film's cynicism.__Every action scene is telegraphed, and most of the dialogue is irrevocably stupid.__This series needs to die here. That would be something to "Yippee Ki-Yay" about.__Pretty much three well-staged action sequences strung together with the dumbest imaginable connective tissue.__A quarter-century after it began, A Good Day to Die Hard continues the franchise without undue embarrassment.__A movie like A Good Day to Die Hard ought to either hire someone who can write catchy dialogue and at least superficially plausible characters or just let the real artists, the stuntmen, run the whole picture. No Humans Allowed.__Time to hang it up, guys ...__This is the first Die Hard movie to run well under two hours (the incomprehensible final 30 minutes have been so furiously chopped, they deserve their own show on the Food Network).
It's not gruesome enough to please genre fans, but not nearly funny enough to be a comedy either. It tries to be a mixture of both and fails.__A muddled teenpic.__This is a love story, done with charm, humor, and tenderness.__It's all very silly and sweet in that indie-nostalgic way that Levine ('The Wackness' and '50/50') has made his own.__Warm Bodies doesn't even have the conviction to follow through on its lame ideas, let alone its good ones. It's a mostly terrible film that misses the opportunity to be a merely mediocre one.__This is a bloody fresh twist on the zombie genre.__Warm Bodies is a funnier and pleasantly cheaper-grade movie than Twilight that aims to draw in both Bella & Edward lovers and haters.__Warm Bodies even suggests that true love can help the right zombie grow a new heart. That's a con job that makes Bodies lukewarm at best.__Though R's mind is nimble in (very witty) voiceover, out loud he can only express himself in a series of groans and grumbles--as touching a metaphor for love-struck adolescence as we may see at the movies this year.__"Warm Bodies" sounds a lot better in theory than it turns out to be in practice.__There are so many clever lines and bits of physical comedy worth revisiting that the movie seems like a likely cult classic, but it's more inclusive than that.__In a genre that's grown so exhausted - what are we, up to "Night of the Resident Evil Dead Part 23" by now? - "Warm Bodies" not only brings in some fresh blood, but has brains to spare.__We're left with a setup that guarantees only 15 minutes of wholehearted enjoyment, followed by 80 minutes of intermittent mild amusement.__A good-natured romantic zombie comedy that plays like a tamer version of The Twilight Saga.__You'd have to be a zombie not to enjoy it.__Fans of "The Walking Dead" can keep moving; there's nothing to see here.__In doing a little genre bending of romantic schmaltz and horror cheese - some fundamental zombie mythology is turned on its head - the film breathes amusing new life into both.__Warm Bodies pulls a nifty trick in the red-hot zombie genre: It lacks a brain, though it eats plenty of them.__An improbable romance sweetened with appealing performances and buoyed by one of the better cute meets in recent romantic comedy ...__[Levine] finds strategies in Warm Bodies to make what has long been considered a deathless tale undead in a new way.
Forget that Giant Slayer feels photocopied and is entirely unnecessary. It's just not exciting.__A mash-up of old-school heroism, pantomime villainy, starstruck lovers and post-'Shrek' archness, it's more exhausting than exhilarating.__It's fast, rousing, and blessedly brief - under two hours instead of, say, nine in three bladder-straining installments.__Unlike Peter Jackson with the overstuffed The Hobbit,[director Bryan]Singer shies away from the epic and settles for entertaining. Sometimes that's more than enough.__Not awful, not wonderful, Jack the Giant Slayer is a midrange fairy tale epic that's a lot more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.__Jack the Giant Slayer is slight, but consistently amusing.__The movie feels so much like a video game that your fingers instinctively itch to do something, though a Jack video game isn't one we'd really want to play.__The script sets up the situation and characters nicely, and the actors are terrific.__Although it often feels there's more of mechanics than the muse keeping Jack the Giant Slayer going, this sprightly fairy tale reworking is full of beans, smartly written and packs plenty of fun.__While it's fine for a director to explore his childhood inspirations, you hope he would bring something a bit more personal to it.__"Jack the Giant Slayer" seems more likely to be "Jack the Giant Bomb."__"Jack" seems designed to appeal to a very narrow, and possibly illusory, demographic: the mature moppet.__It's fast paced, energetic, and enormously likeable.__Singer's take on ye olde yarne has wit about it, and it certainly looks good.__There may never have been a Jack tale that delivered so little pleasure for so many dollars as what we have here.__What's the point of making a movie with a 9-year-old boy's sensibility, then including just enough violence to garner a PG-13 rating?__Jack's problem is that he's a commoner, but the movie's problem is that its script is commoner still, an enchantment-free pretext for animated action, straight-ahead storytelling and ersatz romance.__"Jack the Giant Slayer" is the kind of old-fashioned, entertaining fantasy-adventure you once saw regularly in theaters.__There's more to this Jack and the Beanstalk adaptation than Fee-fi-fo-fum.__It feels like a film made by a committee, for a demographic rather than an audience. It's a tale full of sound and fury (and flying bodies) signifying nothing.
Writer-director James DeMonaco's The Purge fritters away its promise in lurid, frenzied violence.__DeMonaco clearly hopes to make a significant moral statement on the level of Shirley Jackson's literary masterpiece The Lottery. Alas, his aim at political conservatives who support the gun lobby falls flat before he can pull the trigger.__If The Purge is as far-sighted as Network proved to be, we are in for very ugly times.__That old horror-movie standard, a homestead besieged by psychos, gets remixed with a bit of Occupy-era class-conflict satire in the disappointing future-set thriller The Purge.__Gimmicky chiller lacks the robustness and distinction needed to support its social-commentary ambitions.__The blunt instrument plot allows for a few sneaky moments of satire and social commentary lite.__When critics bemoan the dumbing down of movies, they're talking about stuff like The Purge.__Instead of being a creepy B-movie about the necessity of suppressing one's animalistic urges, "The Purge" is just a product of uninspired filmmaking.__In its own clumsy, exaggerated way, The Purge takes a strong stand against our cultural obsession with violence and our tendency to conflate justice with vengeance.__Fans, gear up for rock-em-sock-em action, yet don't be disappointed if much of the goonery seems a bit tepid and, dare I say, staged.__A nutty if bloody lark, with a strange artificiality to the behaviors it portrays. That blunts the sharpness of any cultural critique it might aspire to.__There's nothing you'd want to see again, particularly served up with all these shaky closeups and off-kilter angles and a cast mostly waiting - like us - for it to be over.__The message just gets louder and louder, cruder and cruder, which is too bad because Mr. DeMonaco knows how to set a stage.__The Purge is not subtle. But why should it be? It's not a movie about class or morality, but about the need for violence -- our own. We are the audience, after all, and we must be purged, too.__Audiences will feel the need for a good cleansing after experiencing The Purge.__It's cultural commentary as blunt instrument - and as blunt instruments are wont to do, it achieves an end while making a bloody mess.__The great premise in "The Purge" - and it is a great premise, while being no "Hunger Games" - is squandered on a few levels.__The vague posters for "The Purge" won't prepare you for how sharp and shockingly subversive this home-invasion flick can be.__Its premise requires more sophisticated layering for the audience to really get on board with the notion that people leading very comfortable lives will suddenly go on a murder bender just because they can.__The Purge is mostly a genre picture trying to layer on some prestige by way of social commentary. The latter falls flat; the film is actually stronger when it just goes for our baser instincts.
It's a celebration of something the movies never celebrate anymore: being old.__The film, directed by Jon Turteltaub, has an easy but mediocre charm.__The actors perform with multiple safety nets and the closest the film ever comes to taking a risk is having Freeman dance to a cover of Earth Wind & Fire's "September."__"This is the like "The Hangover Part 43."__It's bad enough when Hollywood casts women over the age of 30 as grandmothers-in-waiting. Now we have to endure an onslaught of famous veteran actors complaining about their hips.__A preholiday trifle that's mildly risque and a lot sentimental.__De Niro and Douglas weirdly play versions of their real selves, while Freeman and Kline ham it up as if they're auditioning for a reality show called Gramps Gone Wild.__None of it is offensive, some of it's funny, and you'll gently, quietly, discreetly start checking your watch over and over again.__Just call this movie The Hangover: AARP Strikes Back.__When it was first announced, wags made the inevitable "It's 'The Hangover' - with walkers!" jokes. If only.__Thanks in no small part to Kline and Steenburgen, "Last Vegas'' has its moments. When they're not on-screen, beware of half-baked ham and hypoglycemic shock.__A mild geezer comedy full of jokes that might have sounded tired at a "Dean Martin Celebrity Roast," the movie has no reason for existence and nothing much to recommend it.__The comedy remains a presence throughout, but "Last Vegas" has a serious purpose, and the resolution of the men's journey of realization is anything but corny.__Musters enough laughs to be passable, if not memorable. And that's thanks to Morgan Freeman's showmanship.__It's the actors, plus an exuberant Mary Steenburgen as quick-witted lounge singer Diana, who make the movie more than a middling copycat.__Alternately trashy and teary, marginally funny, occasionally cringe-inducing.__A misfire from start to finish, a waste of a prodigious amount of talent.__A joyless buddy movie from genial hack Jon Turtletaub.__Injecting a dose of dumbed-down nostalgia into a certain smash comedy about four dudes on the loose in Sin City, this arthritic exercise should be called "The Combover."__You'll groan as much as howl at the jokes, but the veteran stars have a ball acting their age. Even when all else fails them, they're good company.
Enough people attended Ender's Game last weekend to place it at the top of the box office. But could any of them have known how profoundly unspectacular an experience they were in for?__While the picture loses some plot tension by assuring the viewer that Ender is basically an okay kid, it gains by showing the growth of the boy into his destiny as "the One."__Straightforward, a bit literal-minded, very faithful to the book and largely compelling.__If you dislike child actors, you might derive a perverse satisfaction from seeing dozens of them look so unhappy to be onscreen.__There are times when a certain grimness weighs on the movie that you wish for more humor. But overall it's an absorbing and thought-provoking spectacle.__Hard to comprehend and even harder to endure.__I can understand wanting to skip Ender's Game as a matter of moral principle, but you can also feel free to blow it off just because it's not that good.__It's to the film's credit that it tackles big questions without offering any easy or clear-cut answers. If only Hood's acumen for storytelling and characterization were just as lofty.__One of those movies in which you can't always tell what's inept and what's purposefully flat.__Ender's Game" works as a contained story and as a table-setting first chapter.__The movie ends up specializing in a kind of dynamic ambivalence. It makes you distrust military triumph and hope for a stable peace.__By the time the movie finally manages to get interesting, audiences may be too numb and their retinas too fried to win back.__A promising if risky start to what is intended to be a blockbuster franchise ...__The space battles don't have the usual problem of looking like video games; instead, they have the unusual problem of looking like terrifically cluttered screensavers.__More considered than your standard lunk-headed blockbuster and certainly visually engrossing, this game is played well.__Butterfield brings lots of adolescent earnestness to his role, and Hailee Steinfeld is an affable sidekick.__We don't really see Ender learning anything, let alone changing. Two major scenes revolve around war games, yet we never really know the rules, or where the players are in relation to each other. It's all weightless.__The movie can't help but feel like a hologram of its fantasy forefathers, a mirage of a drama despite some stunning visuals.__"Ender's Game" turns out to be our game as well.__Ender's Game is recognizable in tone, thematic content, and narrative progression as Card's vision.
Jackman is still in his phase of high-masculine misery... The entire performance is an exclamation point, and he swings it like a baseball bat.__Prisoners is weary after ten minutes, and I suppose it has persuaded itself that its length is justified by its solemn gaze into the abyss.__In less talented hands, the story could lapse into the maudlin. But Villeneuve, director of the Oscar-nominated Incendies, seems to know just how far to go; only one moment feels less than authentic, but it would be a spoiler to mention it.__It's got lofty aspirations but it also wants to wallow in the muck - to thrill you and sicken you in equal measure while also being About Something.__Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore.__Prisoners is unforgettably relentless in asking moviegoers if Keller has gone too far. And, by extension, asking us how far we would go.__A film that, for all its pretensions and intermittent power, is essentially high-grade claptrap.__Prisoners is an overblown missing-children mystery that wants to comment on the dysfunctional soul of America.__Prisoners has got more pedigree than a Westminster dog-show winner. It's just not very good. In fact, it's worse than not-very-good; it's could've-been-really-good-and-isn't.__The film you begin watching when the lights dim is not the same one you carry home from the theatre.__After two hours of relentless tension, Prisoners starts revealing its secrets to progressively hokier effect.__Is it the best Hollywood mystery we've seen in awhile? Oh yes. Is it one any parent would want to see? Only if they don't mind nightmares.__It never lets up. The cell doors never open.__In addition to the skin-crawling camera moves and the understated dread that bolsters the surface tensions of "Prisoners" there is a fascinating actor's duel going on.__A film that seems headed toward one conclusion, then veers toward another over 2/&#8322; of the fastest-moving hours I've seen in a recent movie.__Grim, gray and surprisingly gruesome, Prisoners - the director's first foray into English-language filmmaking - has its flaws, but predictability is not one of them.__The plot raises complicated moral questions about how far an anguished person will go for the love of a child. At the same time, it sets up an intricate, horrifying mystery with breathtaking skill.__"Prisoners" is a dark, deeply serious examination of how loss can unhinge us; it grabs onto you, and you may have trouble shaking it away.__A gorgeous but manipulative thriller that wants you to ponder Big Questions as it sends a shiver down your spine.__A work of impressive craftsmanship that winds up making us think too much about how it was fashioned rather than what it has to say.
As drama, After Earth offers no surprises; as action, it's rarely stimulating; as a parenting manual, it seems that Will has thrown Jaden into water that's a little too deep.__Most disappointing is the film's lack of ambition, as what could have been a sparky mainstream space opera becomes just another tedious jungle chase movie.__The movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame, and it sticks to that concept, without surprise.__A film in which the text and subtext-an effortlessly gifted father presses his less-talented son to follow in his footsteps-are in perfect alignment. Alas, only in one of the two does the story end happily.__By the standards of M. Night's Shyamalan's recent films, After Earth is surprisingly not horrible.__It's no classic, but it's a special movie: spectacular and wise.__It's impossible to take this movie seriously, certainly not as seriously as it takes itself.__The characters are emotionally neutered; the average viewer won't care about them. The pacing is plodding and uneven.__Too bad, too, that the CGI creatures in the film look as fake as the monkeys in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.__Even with his charismatic dad in his earpiece calling the shots, Jaden can't turn himself into a movie star by sheer force of Will.__After Earth at least looks distinctive, and the movie's overall atmosphere of close-quarter jungle delirium is enhanced by the cramped, earth-toned interiors of spaceships, off-world colony condos and crashed cockpits.__It's just a somewhat mundane coming-of-age story with a terribly miscast lead.__Is "After Earth" the worst movie ever made?__There is no small irony that this sci-fi action adventure is about surviving a serious crash. The scorched earth left behind by "After Earth" is sure to leave a scar on everyone involved.__Much of Will's dialogue consists of life lessons imparted to the boy, and they sound like a motivational seminar.__The futuristic production design is blandly generic, the special effects, props and costumes cheap and slapdash-looking.__What undoes the film is its rather rancid parent-child sentimentality (a Shyamalan staple, admittedly) and a charisma-free performance from the younger Smith that suggests the apple has fallen very far from the tree, indeed.__Mr. Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, are producers on "After Earth," which suggests that there was no one on the production who could really say no to him.__The truly sad thing is, this wouldn't be a bad story if you stripped away all the sci-fi flash and psychobabble.__Though it's meant to be pulse-pounding, After Earth is a lethargic slog.
This is one of the more disappointing efforts of the holiday movie season.__Stiller's attempt to braid together introspection and humor kept me engaged and curious, even when I wasn't quite sure what he was setting out to do.__Stiller's sensibility creates a movie that's smarter than you think it will be. Kind of like Walter Mitty himself.__Sometimes you see failed films and think, well, they tried for this or that but couldn't pull it off. After seeing Ben Stiller's version of the venerable James Thurber story, I don't know what the film was trying for.__It has little narrative interest and requires that the director latch onto a very specific airy tone of whimsy, lest the whole souffle collapse.__Painstakingly stylish, this is Stiller's most ambitious directorial work to date but also his most cloying.__While stunning sequences show him skateboarding away from an erupting volcano and fighting off a great white shark, the character never becomes more than a fuzzy conceit.__This is a notably more upbeat attitude than the original short story had and Stiller sells it well.__It can be sentimental, but it is not frivolous.__It's hard to pinpoint the cause of the problem, but Walter's story never engages.__In our daydreams, an ambitious, world-embracing movie like "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" deserves to be a bigger hit than yet another "Night at the Museum" or "Madagascar" sequel. But your mileage may vary.__"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is star/director Ben Stiller's big swing for the fences, his bid to deliver a whopper that defines him as a filmmaker of the first rank. It's a swing and a miss.__Our identification gives way to envy, and [Mitty] is another one of those enchanted people the rest of us can only dream of becoming.__The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is filled with small, memorable moments that coalesce into a sweet, if predictable, parable about embracing life.__For much of its first half, during which visuals replace vision, Walter Mitty stumbles down a rabbit hole of technological triumph. But then something unexpected happens: It turns into a sweetly engaging blockbuster.__The movie feels uncertain as to its own tones and intentions.__Mitty pays tribute to people who cherish the past and, in the face of extinction, are devoted to preserving it.__Like Mitty, Stiller dreams big. The problem is that audiences don't let him. He's both famous and forgotten, the best comedy director of his generation hiding in plain sight.__Dreams not only come true in the wonderful "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," they're the stuff everyday life is made of.__You're going to find it all either enormously empowering or deeply calculated: an Arcade Fire-scored TV commercial for instant spirituality.
An animated film that goes lamely where many have gone before.__Just like its hero and his grounded starship, Escape From Planet Earth is, for much of the film, a decidedly earthbound adventure.__Colorful as the 3-D aliens-among-us comedy is to look at, though, Corddry is handed a role that's beige as can be, and so are his castmates.__A lightweight, warp-speed, brightly colored trifle that should delight small children and sporadically amuse their parents.__It never discovers new worlds, but "Escape From Planet Earth" is, in its genial way, escape enough.__A children's movie about space-traveling blue beings that has lots of high-flying escapades but fairly low aspirations.__Has it all for people looking for nothing.__Passable animated entertainment is stronger on humor than adventure.__The late Douglas Adams summed up Earth as "mostly harmless," a description that also applies to this eminently tolerable animated time-filler.__It's a bowl of warm water into which no one has bothered to place a bouillon cube. The kids in the theater with me never mustered a single laugh or gasp of excitement. It's plenty o' nuttin'.__It's unchallenging fun for a younger crowd, but adults might feel like they're staring down a colorful 24-piece board puzzle, trying to figure out how such a simple activity could be drawn out over 90 minutes.__It ... provides a few smiles, and a decent amount of rainy-day, kiddie entertainment.__A sci-fi chuckler that somehow manages to elude tedium, despite being a revisionist rip of rival 'toons, from Pixar on down.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
It speaks to the courage and resilience of one man, the savagery of many, and the potential, for both good and for ill, in us all.__The cumulative emotional effect is devastating: the final scenes are as angry, as memorable, as overwhelming as anything modern cinema has to offer.__So overpowering is this film's simple, horrible, and almost entirely true story that it's hard to get enough distance on 12 Years a Slave to poke at its inner workings.__Every scene of 12 Years a Slave, and almost every shot, conveys some penetrating truth about America's original sin.__The power of McQueen's movie is in its declaratory style: This happened. That is all, and that is everything.__It is a film that necessity and education demand seeing.__It provokes recognition in us of the very heart of darkness. It makes the unimaginable imaginable.__"12 Years a Slave" isn't easy to watch, and it shouldn't be; it's one man's tragedy, but it's also the tragedy of countless thousands of souls beaten down, literally and metaphorically.__The film is both brutal to watch and stunning to contemplate, powerfully challenging audiences - particularly white audiences - to examine their consciences.__Slavery is revealed for the unrelenting horror that it was. About time.__One of the best and most courageous films of the year.__12 Years a Slave is at times difficult to watch but always impossible to turn away from.__This is not medicine for America to swallow; it's filmmaking of the highest caliber.__"12 Years a Slave" lays out an institution so twisted and wrong that its honest portrayal has been avoided for centuries. Yes, it's dark and brutal. It needs to be.__One of the finest historical movies ever made.__But the much talked-about 12 Years a Slave is more than a beautifully shot art piece. It's history made violently real.__Other movies and books have gone here, but few so far and with such overwhelming clarity of purpose.__The film offers a formidable indictment of the cruelty of which human beings are capable.__12 Years a Slave is likely the most painful, clear-eyed feature ever made about American slavery. In that light, it almost seems faint praise to add that it will also likely prove to be the best film of the year.__It is Ejiofor - bewildered, sorely tested, morally towering - whose staggered dignity anchors the film.
Free Birds is not (sorry) a turkey of a film. But it doesn't really soar terribly high either.__A lot of agreeable kookiness compensates for the ramshackle script in this tale of turkeys traveling back in time to prevent becoming an essential part of Thanksgiving dinner.__The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents - at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans.__Everything about "Free Birds" feels perfunctory, from its generic title and holiday setting to its starry voice cast and undistinguished use of 3-D.__A stale turkey hash that heaves a lot of ingredients in the oven but never turns on the gas, a frantic attempt to come up with an animated film built around Thanksgiving Day traditions.__A forgettable - and occasionally borderline offensive - animated tale of turkeys trying to take back Thanksgiving.__All sidekicks and sight gags, with little story cohesion or purpose.__The concept is inane, and the execution is manic and unoriginal.__Like the ungainly avian creatures at the center of the herky-jerky adventure, this 'toon seldom gets off the ground.__Finally, there's a movie vegetarian parents can enjoy with their impressionable offspring.__It isn't cute. It isn't really funny. It just kind of is.__A welcome foray into underexploited territory, conceptually at least.__A seasonally pegged 3D cartoon bore that sets the bar so low, it could give a slug a concussion.__A solid premiere effort that shows Reel FX's potential to produce quality full-length animation. But the story-line, with its hypothetical constituents, seems a little desperate at times, even for a kiddie film.__This cheerfully gonzo kid flick. It's no masterpiece, but if you're hoping for a family film that will keep everyone reasonably entertained, this will fly.__A film that was probably close to completion before anyone involved realized they were portraying a fight between turkeys and English settlers as the largest conflict in the European colonization of North America.__Likable and amusing, if slight.__Often, you can point to a middling animated film's visuals as its saving grace. But this colonial world, which should feel like an expansive autumnal panorama, feels oddly inert and two-dimensional.__A more than worthy (and weird) holiday diversion for the whole family.__Like so many modern animated features, Free Birds packs too much in; the picture feels cramped and cluttered, and, despite its occasionally manic action, it moves as slowly as a fattened bird waddling toward its doom.
If this long-delayed and blatantly pandering CGI malarkey is anything to go by, Hollywood's current craze for fairy tales isn't going to have a happy ending.__There isn't much to this beyond the poorly staged, rapidly edited violence; the witches, all but devoid of backstory, are basically canvasses for cartoon splatter.__The movie settles for showers of gore with intermittent moments of spoofiness.__The whole kidding trope, which you can bet was ordered by McKay and Ferrell, is pretty lame, and defeats the leads' attempts to bring shadings to cardboard cartoon characters.__At least it puts forth a sound message: Kids, avoid overdoing it on sweets -- especially candy that doubles as drywall.__It's a grim fairy tale, all right.__Eighty-eight minutes of trash.__I doubt that they had Strike Anywhere matches in the 14th century, and I'm pretty sure nobody said things like "Whatever happens, stay cool."__What on Earth are Renner and Arterton doing in this godforsaken thing?__The good news is that the actors appear to be having fun. The bad news is that we're not.__Wirkola tears through "Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters" with such giddy abandon, it ends up being splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun.__For all the perspiration in jazzing up an old yarn, there's not a whiff of originality in how Wirkola engages with the perverse pleasures enshrined by the Grimm brothers, two of their era's shrewdest storytellers.__There isn't much swashbuckling chemistry between Mr. Renner and Ms. Arterton, and the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status ...__It isn't a movie so much as a mechanical process.__A rarely funny spoof that's heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing.__The movie has been sitting on the shelf for a while, and like, say, a house of candy you might find in the woods, it's gotten a bit stale.__This may be the longest 90 minutes you ever spend in a theater. You've been warned.__Even if he's slumming, Renner gets it best: his dry delivery fully acknowledges the movie's ridiculousness. If you're planning on entering this fractured fairy tale, you'll want to follow his lead.__While the film rarely provokes any strenuous eye-rolling, it also can't drum up even the slightest interest in the fate of its characters, let alone suspense.__The film isn't funny enough for comedy or scary enough for horror, and the anachronisms are ludicrous.
Despite much old-school splatter, it's seldom frightening and oddly unfunny.__An effectively relentless gore-fest.__Five years from now, will you want to watch this bloody $14 million extravaganza or Raimi's shoestring original, which was Amateur Hour elevated to pop art? Evil Dead just bleeds money.__A stylish and worthy homage: inventive even as it is derivative, never quite jokey but never taking itself too seriously, and clocking in at an entirely appropriate 91 minutes. Any longer would be unmerciful; any shorter, ungenerous.__Though it never channels the raw DIY energy of the original Evil Dead series -- what big-budget version could? -- this polished, clever remake remains true to the spirit of the original, which was at once viscerally terrifying and weirdly lighthearted.__A gore fest that's just effective enough to whet fans' appetite for a sequel, even as it kills everyone else's appetite for dinner.__There isn't much to do here except turn the gore up to 11; if you've ever wondered what it would be like to jam a chainsaw into someone's mouth (and who hasn't?), this will give you a good working idea.__Sure, this is a higher-budget re-tread. But a remake shouldn't exist simply to ramp up the graphic violence, even if special effects have improved immeasurably in the past 30 years.__So long as you grit your teeth and keep your eyes on the screen, it's an enjoyable, if almost academic, exercise in bad taste.__Raimi set the bar high, and if Alvarez can't quite rise to his level, he overcompensates by drowning everything in blood. It's overkill, but in this case that's not such a bad thing.__It's a fun spookshow - if chainsaw violence is your idea of fun - but it's sure not my "The Evil Dead." But that's OK. It's someone else's, now.__What this "Evil Dead" gets most right is its tone, paying homage yet staking its own territory; it's scary without being downbeat, fun without being too jokey.__The new "Evil Dead" has none of the first movie's handmade charm or hilarity, intentional or otherwise.__While it's impossible to surpass the original - so much of its fame is a function of its time - Alvarez's version still manages to measure up.__This Evil Dead is polished and meticulously planned, and it benefits from the attention to detail as well as from Alvarez's obvious love for the spirit of the source material.__Bloody havoc? Check. Exuberant gore? Check. Fun? Meh.__It's not scary. It's not shocking. It just wallows in viscera.__This blood-soaked remake improves on its cheeky source material, paying homage while establishing its own identity for younger horror fans who never knew there was an earlier "Evil Dead."__Whether you think it's a good movie will depend largely upon your stomach for gruesome violence. Then again, if you are going to see a movie called "Evil Dead," you're probably going to be OK.__"Evil Dead" turns Raimi's homemade horror treat into a professional-looking, overscripted bore.
Ultimately, it's popcorn nihilism without the big laughs that helped distract from the casual approach to life and death in 'Red'.__This is a likable, almost gentle comedy and also a violent action film about the possibility of a nuclear bomb going off in a major city.__Willis is self-evidently capable of kicking the asses of men considerably younger than himself. But at some point shouldn't he consider an alternative pastime?__No movie with this much ass-kicking should feel so lifeless.__Ridiculously action-packed and just as endearing, Red 2 is why we go to sequels despite our well-earned cynicism about studios churning them out.__It's nice to see oldsters cavorting in kaboom movies, but a little of this stuff goes a long way.__What's interesting about 'RED 2' is that, not only is it better than its predecessor, it is miles better ...__What was once engagingly silly is now much closer to insultingly dumb.__The best thing about RED 2, like its predecessor, is its lightness of tone. Too many movies with comic-book roots come on too seriously, even when the comics themselves have a loose, fast, jocular wit about them.__As in the first film, the seasoned-pro cast provides the few fleeting pleasures to be found.__It's quite possible that Helen Mirren has never had to speak such terrible dialogue in her life.__Recycled, Expensive, Dull.__Sequels are, for the most part, inherently stale, so it's no shock the luster has faded in "Red 2." The bigger surprise is just how clunky and unsatisfying this follow-up feels.__Cars careen, lazily written infiltration plans are executed, and the violence is plentiful and toothless.__If everyone delivered their lines with the rat-a-tat-tat precision of Malkovich, Mirren and Hopkins, the studio might have had a better movie on its hands.__How bad could the boneyard be compared to sitting through this execrable piece of non-entertainment? Better dead than "RED 2."__This sequel to the action comedy about veteran espionage agents charging back into action lacks elegance and wit and is devoid of thrills, except for those brought by Byung-hun Lee as a Korean contract killer.__Enemies and allies have changed sides so many times so randomly, that you're not sure who's fighting whom or why. You just know they all look a little old to be engaged in this sort of reckless behavior.__Passable summer entertainment - an Expendables with people who can act.__Any movie that gives Helen Mirren a chance to shoot really big guns, wear an ermine astrakhan and channel Bette Davis as Queen Elizabeth can't be all bad, and "Red 2" isn't, though it comes close.
Larry the Cable Guy and Madea are an oddly perfect pairing. They're both comedians in drag - Larry just gets to wear pants__The same slapdash, lightweight effort as Madea in any other season, with a few Yuletide flourishes.__Slapdash, with dialogue and plot points that were cliches in Dickens' era, the pic sends up, then reaffirms, all the values the media sell us each holiday: compassion, forgiveness, tolerance.__The humor seems sour and perfunctory from the start.__You can see, and hear, the clanking of his melodramatic machinery - the gears and pulleys of emotion - but by the time the movie is over, you've been wedged into those gears; they have you.__By the standards of Tyler Perry's Madea series, A Madea Christmas is better than average.__The one fascination of A Madea Christmas is how little care the country's most popular and powerful indie filmmaker takes in shaping his own material.__A crass weapon in the crusade against the War on Christmas, the yuletide-themed Madea avoids pushing buttons in hopes of meeting the requirements for annual replay on cable.__With a character who can essentially say and do whatever she wants, you might expect a bit more.__The prolific multi-hyphenate media mogul has pumped out an endless array of movies in recent years, but his latest effort ranks as one of his very worst.__Bah humbug.__Comedy characters change and grow. Sometimes, as we see in Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas, they become so much like old relatives that their edge is gone.__An exceptionally poor piece of holiday cash-in product, rushed and ungainly even by the low standard set by Perry's seven previous Madea films, yet it should be every bit as profitable.__Perry seemed to be holding his nose and trudging through the disappointing Madea's Witness Protection, but this time Madea has her groove back, and she's a riot.__Only one terrible sub-plot away from being a legitimately good movie.__I don't know, maybe it worked as theater. Onscreen, it's torture.__None__None__None__None
This is a cleverly made, smartly written, totally satisfying armrest-gripper.__Just when the movie has us in its grasp, the script falls to pieces and turns into a crass female-in-peril button-pusher.__Crude as it is, The Call milks its jump scares and don't-go-down-to-the-basement tension for all they're worth. See it with a full house, if you absolutely must see it at all.__Let's call The Call what it is: high quality trash that both diminishes and is redeemed by all the talents who have deigned to bring it to life.__If you're going to watch a movie in which two people talk on the phone for most of the film, it's not the worst thing in the world for one of the folks involved to have the face of Storm from the X-Men.__This is as brain-dead as a movie can be and it assumes the audience will have the I.Q. of a rutabaga.__It's a lot better than you might expect a movie like this to be.__"The Call" consciously decides to slowly drown itself in the tub.__Yes, it's cheese, but it's good cheese.__I'll say one thing for "The Call": Its ending is actually a bit of a surprise. Just when you think it couldn't get any stupider, pow!__Can't someone come up with screenwriting software that signals when a script has made the fatal slip from hyped-up suspense to sheer ludicrousness?__... a breakneck, truly thrilling thriller, one that builds excitement through both brains and brutality ...__The material has the mild impact of a special episode of a network crime series, with Eklund's villain a figure of mannered creepiness rather than profound chills.__If it were any more intense would require a complete physical and medical clearance for admission into the theater.__A sputtering, so-so B thriller with a neat hook but very little personality.__The Call cribs from so many other psychological thrillers that it might as well be called "The Girl With the Lovely Bones Cellular Silence of the Lambs.''__An effectively creepy thriller about a 911 operator and a young miss in peril, "The Call" is a model of low-budget filmmaking.__The shoddy attention to character, plausibility, and detail is particularly surprising coming from Anderson, a director of smart indie thrillers like The Machinist, Session 9 and Transsiberian.__Thinking about seeing The Call? You may want to put that on hold.__Maybe Anderson wants to sell out, but he's not very good at it.
Gangster Squad looks the part, but it's so superficial it practically evaporates before our eyes.__Some of the clothes and makeup feel as glossy as paint, but, those aside, we seem to browsing through a display of secondhand goods.__It might sound like a stretch, imagining Penn playing that intense, indiosyncratic a villain. But the lauded, veteran actor pulls a left hook, then a right, and after a wild bodyshot at the tail end of the film, you see the true mania behind his eyes.__Director Ruben Fleischer and screenwriter Will Beall can't decide whether to make a spoof or a serious drama, so they wrongheadedly attempt both.__Gangster Squad" is a highly stylized, pulp-fiction period piece based on true events.__Despite a cast of gifted actors, lush 1940s production design and suave costumes, it's bereft of inspiration, plowing familiar terrain past the point of tedium to impatience.__Gangster Squad is to the great tradition of the Scarface genre what plastic is to cutlery - tiny, imitative, disposable.__Any resemblance to history here is restricted to some snazzy spectator shoes and cans of Schlitz beer.__"Gangster Squad" talks tough and hits hard, but it is a victim of its own brute force.__A cartoonish 1940s shoot-'em-up that's impossible to take seriously.__Director Ruben Fleischer leans hard on the violence card, but with little return in the way of excitement, and at the expense of character and story.__Slick, sick, self-consciously stylish and defiantly shallow, Gangster Squad is one of those movies you can't talk about without invoking other (often better) movies.__Gangster Squad is The Untouchables moved west and cheesed up.__A triumph of production design but a pretty dull kill-'em-up otherwise.__Apart from the gore -- and there's plenty -- this is basically L.A. Confidential without the script.__A bullet-riddled bloodbath with an all-star cast, Gangster Squad is a lurid and ludicrous Mob thriller that glorifies a gangland lifestyle.__There's only so much style can do to spiff up shriveled substance.__"Gangster Squad" would have been more fun as an animated feature, with fanciful animals in the principal roles.__When the gun smoke clears, the body count is finished and the blood is mopped up, "Gangster Squad" is little more than another Hollywood wannabe overshadowed by the legacy of "L.A. Confidential"...__A complete whitewashing of one of the most vicious and racist paramilitary organizations in American history: the Los Angeles Police Department.
You don't need a heart to like this movie. You need an MBA.__Similar to Eddie Murphy's hard right turn from daring and profane comedy to family-friendly romps, Vaughn and Wilson have gone all soft and gooey here.__It's a testament to the duo's jazzy comic chemistry that they wring some laughs from this dated, frankly sinister premise.__There are plenty of films out there competing for your money ... 'The Internship' doesn't even deserve a part-time gig ...__Like many an intern, this sweet, negligible comedy, starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as Google's oldest interns, doesn't live up to its potential.__One of those movies that milks its stars' inherent charisma for as long as it can, but it does so mainly because it has little else.__A pleasant collection of mild laughs.__The Internship doesn't break any new comedic ground...But it's an amiable, occasionally laugh-out-loud fish-out-of-water tale that gently mocks our modern technological age while simultaneously embracing it.__Today's weather forecast in Mountain View? Giddy with a chance of delirious.__The Internship just might be the saddest movie of 2013. That few will realize this makes it even sadder.__Google, the corporate entity, is so lovingly portrayed that the film itself resembles nothing so much as a massive product tie-in.__The Internship is a big wet kiss to Google wrapped in a buddy comedy that asks us to believe that nobody over 40 knows anything about computers or the online universe.__The fact that this overlong, often preposterous comedy succeeds at all (which it does, only occasionally) proves that the Vaughn/Wilson charm can still work a measure of magic.__This is the biggest product placement in history, with the Google brand treated as something we should all happily bow down before. There's something seriously disturbing in this.__Though by no means a good movie, The Internship floats along for fairly well for about half its length, thanks to the easy interplay between the two stars and a certain melancholic topicality.__The film becomes just one big product placement, with callow co-stars and by-the-numbers plotting.__Levy's so busy showing us the riderless cars and cheery Google bikes, he forgets to have his movie make any sense.__Everything about it feels stale: the actors, the story, the comedy, everything. And, to make matters worse, that everything goes on for an interminable two hours.__A movie sorely bereft of ideas, laughs and justification for the comic duo's undifferentiating self-regard.__The director, Shawn Levy, and the writers, Mr. Vaughn and Jared Stern, have dreamed up a feel-good comedy that plays like a demo reel of deja views.
Snitch runs close to two hours, and it's a credit to Summit Entertainment that they didn't reduce it to 90 minutes of Mexican drug loons trying to run John's truck off the highway.__The film tries to paint in shades of gray with vague criticisms of the war on drugs, but the absurdity of its he-man Everyman plot ends up turning its moral palette a muddy brown.__In the end, this is a movie that lives or dies on Johnson's performance, and luckily, the actor is perfect ...__Yes, this is a film where The Rock Wikipedias "drug cartels." But somehow it works.__Despite its apparent compromises to noble finger-wagging (initially) and requisite fist-pumping (eventually), Waugh has fashioned a sturdy character-first entertainment out of Snitch.__Dwayne Johnson tries so hard to be taken seriously in the ponderous and preposterous drama Snitch that it hurts to watch him in much the same way it hurts to watch the weightlifting competition at the summer Olympics.__Ultimately, unfortunately, this is a property that probably would have been better as one of Johnson's old, less ambitious films - straightforwardly violent, and crammed with two-fisted revenge - than as this more polite, issue-oriented thriller.__What a pleasant surprise.__When the list of the year's most eminently forgettable films is drawn up at the end of 2013, "Snitch" will likely be near the top.__"Snitch" is protein-and-starch filmmaking at its utilitarian -- and belly-filling -- best.__The dialogue is preachy, the drama too earnest and the action kind of sluggish, though it's hard not to get a jolt when Johnson jumps behind the wheel.__Based on a true story, it has the weirdness of real life, which is good. But also like real life, it has that funny way of not making much sense or being all that enjoyable.__In its focus on an ordinary family facing a nightmarish scenario, Snitch is a terrifying but relatable story.__Mr. Johnson's screen presence, however charismatic, is out of sync with the rest of the movie.__Whatever lizard-brain fun might have been had in watching Johnson do battle against a drug cartel is weakened by the occasional hard tug at the social conscience. The film winds up divided against itself.__In "Snitch," Dwayne Johnson delivers a strong, disciplined performance as an ordinary civilian trapped in a Kafkaesque corner of the legal system.__Someone please get director Ric Roman Waugh a tripod!__Its nominal outrage over the severity of our nation's sentencing laws for first-time drug offenders is quickly subsumed by a jacked-up narrative of a father going to extremes to save his son.__Ultimately, the social-issue element of the movie gets buried in the wreckage, but it's comforting to know it's there.__Nobody is going to confuse a Dwayne Johnson movie with "Les Miserables." But "Snitch" gets a decent amount of drama (and action, of course) out of the argument that there's paying for a crime, and then there's overpaying.
He's spent the bulk of his career hiding in franchises, hypermasculinizing himself. We can live with this. But this new movie makes you wonder whether Diesel can.__David Twohy's film is scarcely original, but the sheer survivalist grind of our hero, against comical odds, becomes appealingly mad ...__A vibrant stylistic mishmash that works brilliantly in chunks but is ultimately too scattered to sustain any cohesion.__Riddick, an alternately kick-ass and clumsy piece of sci-fi claptrap that puts its empty head down and gets the job done.__Fans of lean, mean, testosterone-steeped sci-fi action are likely to find Riddick kind of a blast, however -- even though it offers few surprises.__The movie's cheap but has a sense of humor, and it's smart enough to let Riddick just get back to being a badass.__Much of the film is over-the-top, but that won't be a surprise to those who saw the previous two installments. Diesel is in fine form, growling his lines and being the most menacing person on screen even when he's in chains.__Twohy is trying to do something with his original character. It's just not clear what that something is anymore. Maybe it's time this franchise fades to black for good.__A modestly budgeted bone Universal Pictures threw at Diesel so he would keep starring in "Fast and Furious" pictures. Those movies are bank; "Riddick" is rank.__The dark palette and extreme close-ups turn every fight into a muddy blur; the staging, which should feel claustrophobic, is too often set in vast (and unconvincing) landscapes.__The movie jogs along nicely without ever getting a case of the stupids; far from being a bloated "John Carter," it's just a pared-down yarn of survival: "Die Hard" on a planet.__In lieu of blockbuster spectacle, Twohy spins wittily choreographed scenes of small-scale carnage, most of it initiated by Riddick himself.__"Riddick" can be cheesy and silly, not to mention excessively violent, but it's also fun.__Move along, there's nothing to see and no one to root for in this murky franchise reboot.__The dust churns, the clouds gather, the bullets fly, the men fall. The Diesel rises.__The first (and one hopes the last) film to borrow heavily from both Alien and Old Yeller.__It's B-grade cinema made with A-level intelligence and imagination -- skillfully directed, surprisingly well acted and gratifyingly preposterous.__Riddick's at his most fun when the pressure's on, and he retreats to plan something special for his new visitors. All the build-up pays off with tense showdowns in the dark, thrilling restraint and ominous suggestion giving way to slasher gore.__In an era of high-falutin' tentpole sci-fi, there's something to be said for a filmmaker still devoted to crafting plain old genre pleasures.__The lack of imagination in Riddick, the third installment in director/writer David Twohy's increasingly forgettable sci-fi franchise, is so stunning that it's almost like a special effect in itself.
Along comes Marlon Wayans to do in A Haunted House what he once did in Scary Movie. And do it much, much worse.__A movie that offends every moral sensibility but delivers few comedic rewards.__Does it even qualify as a movie? Why did it take two people to write and cost $2.5 million to make?__You might chuckle at Wayans huddled in the tub, frantically trying to scrub himself clean of something slightly more earthly-freaky than evil spirits. But watching him get it on with stuffed animals? Ick.__There are vague hints that the story is "really" about the difficulties and anxiety of commitment, but then one of many variations on a fart joke distracts from any actual idea.__If the opening gag in your R-rated movie is an extended flatulence joke you should reconsider whether you're qualified to make such a movie.__Harkens back to the initial days of the oughties spoof craze, when screenwriters actually lampooned film genres rather than whatever the hell happened to catch their eye on YouTube as they sought inspiration.__Disrespect is the name of the game for this flat, by-the-numbers Paranormal Activity spoof, which suggests that letting your girlfriend move in with you is pretty much tantamount to opening the gates of hell.__The craftsmanship here isn't just lacking, it's nonexistent, and the found-footage conceit is little more than a rickety structure to house an endless gauntlet of hackneyed jokes involving sex, flatulence, pot, and feces.__A frenetic and freewheeling satirical comedy that only sporadically scores a bull's-eye while aiming at easy targets.__This parody of Paranormal Activity and other found-footage horror films too often substitutes raunch for wit.__The homophobia that saturates [this film] is no mere joking around. It comes from a place of hate and [the filmmakers] must be held accountable.__Mean-spirited, badly made and unfunny is one set of disasters; adding in storytelling incompetence adds to the catastrophe.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
There's nothing pretty or exciting about this movie (inexplicably, it's in 3-D), even when all anyone's doing is fighting.__The pacing is cloddish and tone unaccountably dour.__A singular viewing experience: a multi-colored downer fantasy which combines bursts of imagination with a bleak worldview, resulting in something that rarely feels mainstream.__Believe it or not, for all its additions, it's too respectful. You want it to be funnier, crazier.__47 Ronin is admirably devoted to its material, but it's almost tedious to watch.__Solemn as a funeral march, humorless as your junior high principal, as Japanese as a grocery-store California roll, Keanu Reeves's let's-mope-about-and-kill-ourselves samurai drama has exactly three things going for it.__An overlong, underwhelming movie now hitting theaters that certainly wasn't worth the wait.__"47 Ronin" can't entirely paper over the void at its center, traceable partly to the shadowboxing of computer-aided filmmaking or studio tinkering.__Memo to Hollywood: Find another use for Keanu Reeves.__The basics of the story remain unchanged, but it's the wanna-be-blockbuster additions that rankle, be it the incoherent direction of first-time feature director Carl Rinsch or the copious CGI beasties who look like rejected Lord of the Rings villains.__[Rinsch] careens from one set piece to another with a blend of passable 3-D and dialogue so wooden, it seems dubbed.__While the visuals are lovely to behold, this unremarkable version of the classic 18th century Japanese legend is stiff and uninvolving.__"47 Ronin" would have been more fun if it kept swinging its sword instead of falling on it.__The eagerness of the major studios to cozy up to Asian markets yields awkward results in 47 Ronin, a lumpy 3D epic from Universal that fuses Japanese historical legend with generic CGI-heavy action fantasy.__As impressive as these visual elements prove to be, the film struggles to grab and maintain audiences' interest, whether or not they know the underlying legend by heart.__Insufferably boring, culturally hegemonic, and profoundly ugly.__None__None__None__None
A sometimes wickedly funny but ultimately sour, loud, draining tale of one of the most dysfunctional families in modern American drama.__This star-studded loopy melodrama is brash, foul-mouthed, self-consciously offensive, intermittently insightful and has a gaping hole where its heart should be.__August: Osage County is all about the acting. That makes sense because the storyline doesn't offer much that could be considered new or remarkable.__August: Osage County is easier to watch on screen, and maybe for that we should be grateful. But there's also something to be said for sitting shell-shocked afterward, shaken and relieved to be free from witnessing more of this family's downfall.__Although a couple of performances here may earn Oscar nominations, by the time you've sat through the wreckage, you're left with the sense that this really must have worked better onstage.__Letts loves manic people, twisted situations and barbed lines that cut with glee and he's disturbingly good at delivering all three.__It is Roberts who makes August: Osage County watchable, and more: As Barbara, the actress' wariness and weariness, her caustic humor - deployed to hide a deep sadness - all ring true.__Offers a nightmare vision of what happens when gaudy histrionics poison a powerhouse ensemble.__Watching it, you may feel like slipping out of the room, closing the door quietly behind you.__Not a great movie but a fine guilty pleasure of acting excess.__The problem was that director John Wells did not understand the play, or at the very least, he did not make his actors understand the play, even at its most basic level.__By the time the movie's climax comes round, the combined fate of this trio is heartbreakingly sad.__With a talent roster this large and a script this pointed, there's not much more director Wells can do than get out of the way - and indeed, that's what he does.__The film can't transcend its theatrical, non-naturalistic roots. An experience that should be shattering is merely battering.__The cloistered farmhouse setting, the surfeit of familiar faces, and the furious emotional pitch all contribute to the stifling sense of claustrophobia that's so key to Letts's writing.__These are tremendous actors, and maybe it all worked better on the stage.__For those who appreciate fiery dialogue delivered by fine actors, "August: Osage County" is heaven-sent.__There are things to enjoy in "August: Osage County," mainly around the edges. But there's a serious case of miscasting at the center.__Cluttering this adaptation with so many identifiable actors and zooming in on them for Nora Desmond-like close-ups detracts from Letts' wounding blitz of sentences.__The director John Wells's adaptation of Tracy Letts's play sits awkwardly on the screen.
What at first seems formulaic comedy gains a deeper resonance as we see how they represent two responses to cruelty and injustice -- first outrage, and with time, eventually, forgiveness.__It's smart and unsweetened.__Even as Philomena embraces the expected feel-good dynamics, it avoids taking the usual path and doesn't paint all of the "evil" nuns with the same brush.__We wouldn't care about any of this if the performances were weak. But both actors find complexity and depth.__At its core, this clever, wrenching, profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty.__Director Steven Frears deserves special mention. A lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy, sentimental junk. The tear-jerking moments here are heartfelt and real. It's the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today.__Dench is a delight, playing dowdy instead of her standard regal, and Coogan is appropriately droll and disillusioned. Together they manage to make a sad story feel somehow bright.__A true story that takes unexpected, unusually poignant turns.__The chemistry between Steve Coogan as a snooty journalist and Judi Dench as a retired nurse searching for her son brings humor and warmth to a harrowing tale of the plight of unwed Irish Catholic mothers in the 1950s.__Go beyond the manner of its telling and you find a story of cruelty and evil, of shocking acts committed under a veneer of civility and sanctity.__"Philomena" is a tearjerker of rare honesty and craft.__An utterly charming combination of road trip, odd-couple comedy and heart-touching true story that will leave few dry-eyed, "Philomena" rests comfortably in the lap of the great Judi Dench.__The story touches on some of the thorniest issues of Catholic doctrine and tempers its righteous anger with a tone more sad than bitter.__Judi Dench plays the title role in "Philomena" with her usual authenticity, which is reason enough to see it, but there are so many more.__Director Stephen Frears manages to successfully walk the tricky line between comedy and dark drama. It keeps the audience off-kilter a bit, but in a good way; we shouldn't always need to know what's coming next, in terms of tone or plot.__Much of the beauty of Philomena, which was directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen), lies in its odd-couple characters and the superb actors portraying them.__Dench, Coogan and sure-handed director Stephen Frears ("The Queen") keep the focus on character, and in "Philomena" they've got an earthbound angel.__It's simple and well-told, although nothing about it is breathtakingly original.__If not for the expertness of [the] actors, Philomena would be a sloggy journey indeed. Fortunately, Dench and Coogan are more than capable of turning water into wine.__A subtly told tale of tragedy and redemption, with much of the sentimental payoff you're expecting but several intriguing plot twists along the way.
This is a deliberately off-kilter, cheerfully violent, hit-and-miss effort with just enough moments of inspiration to warrant a recommendation.__A movie with a PG brain and a NC-17 body count, unsuitable for audiences of any age.__An all-star cast fails to rise above bloody japes and heavy-handed humor in this tale of a renegade Mob family hiding in a small French town.__A black comedy that doesn't begin to jell but has a sweetheart of a cast and the odd diverting moment.__The casting of Robert De Niro as an ex-Mafioso hiding in witness protection is witty in only the silliest, most superficial way. It's a joke with its own tinny, built-in laugh track.__The Family is a film at once strange and intriguing. It can't seem to settle on a tone.__The film isn't worthy of De Niro's stature, in the gangster sub-genre or otherwise.__A love letter to Scorsese constructed with all the grace of Mr. Bean.__If cultural treason were a capital offense, "The Family" director Luc Besson would be on death row.__"The Family" does have its entertaining moments. But anyone who thinks it's a real knee-slapper needs therapy. Stat.__It doesn't even try for basic credibility. But buoyed by hot performances, it sustains a zapping electrical energy.__Curiously airless, weightless and tonally uncertain, Luc Besson's mafia comedy falls flat.__Besson's history is one of making crowd-pleasing entertainment and The Family is no different.__Not known for subtlety, Besson gets the expected laughs, and then some.__Remember when Robert De Niro was an interesting actor? These days his talent, like his character in "The Family," is in the witness protection program, never to be seen again.__The Blakes think they're vigilantes, but in most other movies they'd be the bad guys.__The thing that saves the movie time and again is Besson's uncanny ability to shift tone, sometimes even within a single sequence, from light comedy to serious action, to genuine emotion and even romance.__[An] oddly paced, overly violent, sometimes amusing but sometimes jarringly unfunny movie.__Besson opts for simple black comedy; laughs and occasional shocks come courtesy of the characters' violent behavior, which is usually relayed through joking, elliptical editing.__No one's ever going to accuse Besson of having a light comic touch, but the mayhem in this minor mob comedy, more often than not, brings the laughs.
an insufferable family adventure whose impressive animation is consistently undercut by cartoonish self-awareness.__The only solace from the uninspired characters and crammed-in factoids are the gags about poop and puke - juvenile, yes, but also appropriate for the film's "back to nature" ethos.__You'd think it'd be hard to screw up a movie about dinosaurs, and yet Hollywood keeps doing so.__Walking With Dinosaurs is too good a visual treat to miss, especially if you catch the 3-D version. But don't expect to enjoy the predictable, paper-thin story.__You could write "Walking With Dinosaurs'' off as harmless filler for the under-5 set, except that the only female dinosaur, Juniper, exists solely to moon over Patchi, who as a hatchling lost part of an ear to a winged predator.__Collee piles on references to such distinctly human concepts as ninjas and ballet, while 21st-century expressions ("Worst migration ever!") and a forgettable selection of pop tunes feel instantly biodegradable.__The movie looks great, the writing is peppered with moments of wit, and there's even an educational component built in as dinosaur facts are displayed on the screen.__The photo-realistic look is striking, but the dialogue is occasionally wince-inducing. Think a sub-par Flintstones episode.__However well-intentioned the movie may be, it spills over with flat cutesy humor, making a slog out of an experience that should be filled with wonder.__It's unlikely that a dinosaur wrote the script-the Writers Guild of America makes no provision for Cambrian membership-but this animated feature is dimwitted all the same.__Aesthetic attention to detail, even when it's painstaking, goes only so far when the content is mediocre.__The good intentions are fossilized under the cutesy poop.__Walking With Dinosaurs 3D is about as dumbed-down as nature cinema can get (at least their lips don't move), made even worse by stereotyped male-female roles that really do hearken back to the Stone Age.__Kids love dinosaurs. But only the littlest kids will love Walking with Dinosaurs.__Unfortunately the filmmakers must have been worried that the science lesson, though perfectly engaging on a visual level, would bore small children, so the movie is stuffed with glib, unfunny wisecracks along the lines of Shrek.__Educational content, clever CGI, and John Leguizamo as a prehistoric bird.__Not only saddles its prehistoric attractions with sassy banter, but also inserts them into an impossibly generic coming-of-age adventure.__Unfortunately, there's no majestic visual this movie can't undercut with bathroom humor as the charmless characters chatter simply to fill the space. Not even aurora borealis is spared.__First-rate CG effects do battle with third-rate dialogue in this 3D adventure based on acclaimed BBC series.__None
Peirce wants to make a hit, and, even with source material this strange, it feels as though she has. But if so, that's all she has made.__Chloe Moretz is unnervingly talented, but Carrie is not a role she was born to play. She hasn't a victim's bone in her body and fluffs the early scenes.__It is a timeless thing for all of us, the ritual of high-school expectation and heartache. Once again, as it did nearly 40 years ago, Carrie turns it into an experience of biblical proportions.__The movie is very good, both as a first-order viewing experience and as a contemporary gloss on Brian De Palma's classic 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's novel.__Rather than fixing some of the problems with De Palma's approach and trying something fresh, Peirce compounds them.__Peirce is gifted, but she lacks the ability of directors like DePalma to transform schlock into something deeply personal.__The new Carrie isn't atrocious - just flat and uninspired and compromised by the kind of mindless teen-movie "humanism" that De Palma so punkishly spat on.__Moore is terrifying as a guilt-addled true believer, and Moretz caresses her role when she gets the chance. And the hot topics do indeed remain hot.__Nothing but a fancy bit of corporate Hollywood graverobbing - slipping into the copyright cemetery, digging up a generous loved one, and calmly stripping her of every bit of gold and silver they can pawn.__Kimberly Peirce's new adaptation of the classic Stephen King novel is a grave but listless thriller.__Its bloodshed may be all dressed up, but it ultimately has nowhere to go.__Kimberly Peirce's remake of Brian De Palma's Carrie isn't a total fiasco like Gus Van Sant's remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, but it's equally gratuitous.__With nothing new to offer, "Carrie" is reduced to attempting the impossible: repeating De Palma's long, tense buildup to Carrie's prom, one of the most stylishly executed horror-film sequences in history.__Literally a pallid imitation of the original.__She blows stuff up real good, in a way that would make the devil - or Bruce Willis - proud.__What's scariest about Carrie in 2013 isn't that this wounded teenage girl has the power to kill -- it's that there are thousands of girls like her with no power at all.__The results are distressingly anemic, pig blood and all.__A well-made, highly satisfying and not particularly deep high school revenge movie.__If you're going to take another stab at this tale of a taunted, traumatized teen who exacts fiery revenge on, well, everyone, then Kimberly Peirce is the director to do it.__Ms. Peirce plays up the story's religious themes and Carrie's burgeoning power as she discovers her telekinetic gifts, even as the dread of the female body that deepens Mr. De Palma's version somehow goes missing.
I watched this movie with three chatty strangers on [a] Thursday night in an otherwise empty theater. Universal couldn't say "no." Looks like that's our job now.__This spends little time on exposition and doesn't go in for any false pathos; compared with most recent comic-book movies, this is lean, unpretentious filmmaking--and to my taste, a lot more fun for it.__Too bad director Robert Schwentke ("RED") and the writing team handling the 3-D screen adaptation don't hold up their end, failing to do much with a premise that felt like it could rate with, say, "Men in Black."__Mr. Bridges is almost always fun to watch, but even his squinting and Slim Pickens-style whooping can't make the time pass faster.__A half-hour into the film, and it feels like the eighth day of jury duty.__With its low-stakes chase scenes, obvious-from-the-get-go villains and nonsensical plotting, this feels more like a 96-minute-long episode of Scooby-Doo that's been laboriously translated into another language and then back into English.__It's an unpleasant way to pass a couple summer hours.__R.I.P.D. is a dud that squanders a decent cast and succeeds neither as the comedy nor the action film it purports to be.__Even though the once-and-forever Dude abides by the rules of the game, he can't raise the pulse on this bomb.__Despite its flaws, "R.I.P.D." is a fairly entertaining and frequently funny movie.__One can't help but wonder what the heck Jeff Bridges is doing there.__The film is a visual mess, with cheap-looking effects hampered even further by crummy and unconvincing 3-D.__Benefits from a hilariously free-associative performance by Jeff Bridges.__R.I.P.D. does offer a pretty good idea of what the afterlife might look like to someone suffering macular degeneration.__The results feel rote and trite, like a mid-1980s NBC pilot designed to take the 9:00 hour between Misfits of Science and Manimal.__Nothing short of wiping their memories with a real-life neuralizer is going to convince moviegoers that the supernatural buddy-cop comedy R.I.P.D. is anything more than a thinly disguised Men In Black ripoff.__God, where do I start?__... the execution is pretty lively, irreverent, visually engaging, and every now and then almost actually witty.__It's not funny. It's not exciting. It's not engaging. It's a waste of time and money. Having seen it, I can understand why it was hidden from critics. The disappointment is that it wasn't hidden from everyone else as well.__Not so much of a movie as it is a movie-like substance ...
Lives constructed on pretense can only stand for so long. Watching them collapse is appalling but undeniably entertaining.__There is all this talent -- and so little reason for it in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.__A sharply observed, post-economic crash comedy-drama that boasts a formidable performance by Cate Blanchett and addresses such pertinent real-world concerns as class, gender and corporate criminality in urban America.__You have to dig deep in Allen's back catalogue to find a single performance as affecting and well-judged as the one Cate Blanchett delivers.__It's narratively uneven but the occasional lapses of focus are rescued by Cate Blanchett's riveting lead performance.__This also benefits from one of the strongest casts he's assembled in years: Cate Blanchett is exceptional in the lead, and there are strong supporting turns from Alec Baldwin, Sally Hawkins, and (in a surprise dramatic turn) Andrew Dice Clay.__Jasmine resembles one of those '50s wives -- widowed or dumped -- who find themselves with nary a skill to survive, or at least not in the manner they'd grown accustomed.__Just when it seemed like Allen was going to settle for cranking out a comic bauble every year for the rest of his career, he comes up with a vital and vibrant knockout of a movie.__As Jasmine's story is revealed, and as Blanchett manages the fragile mask of her character's sanity, the film builds to a mighty emotional pitch.__A wrenching portrait of a woman whose life has fallen apart.__Blanchett is steady as she goes, delivering one of the most exhilarating performances of the year.__Despite some thin writing, it's Allen's weightiest work in years.__Blanchett excels at every turn, from the haughty airs and headstrong sense of entitlement to the fragile and inevitable disintegration that made the hair on my arms stand up.__There's never been a better director of women than Woody Allen. Actresses in his films have earned five Oscars from 11 nominations. Cate Blanchett in "Blue Jasmine" should make it an even dozen.__Allen is a famously hands-off director, and while this method succeeds on occasion, too many scenes in Blue Jasmine betray a directorial negligence.__Blue Jasmine ranks with Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris at the top of Woody Allen's recent movies.__Blanchett owns this movie as thoroughly as her character owns her delusions.__Blanchett in "Blue Jasmine" is beyond brilliant, beyond analysis. This is jaw-dropping work, what we go to the movies hoping to see, and we do. Every few years.__It isn't always easy to watch. It isn't exactly fun (although parts are funny). Blanchett's performance sometimes overpowers the story. But it's an essential work in Allen's later canon.__Plenty of fine actresses have delighted in Allen's snappish comic rhythms, which the writer never really loses, even in drama. Or in drama borrowed from Tennessee Williams.
Kevin Hart's (Along Came Polly) audience loves him, but if you're not in love yet, this probably won't start the infatuation for you.__Once Hart finally gets onstage his act can barely live up to the hype.__Any comic who can play the Garden must be good, but you wouldn't know it from this jumble of random routines and on-the-bus footage.____He is, maybe, a little too frenetic, too frequently at full speed. But when he gets rolling, the laugh lines come quick, one after the other, and he kills.__He tells elliptical stories that go on so long and take so many weird detours that they end up being funny even when they shouldn't be.__If you were to judge Let Me Explain purely on its performance portion, filmed at Madison Square Garden during Hart's 2012 tour, the film would merit a full extra star. But at 75 minutes, it feels too skimpy to rave over.__Let Me Explain finds Hart at the peak of his powers, so the film's long coronation feels justified, if gaudy. Strip away the preamble and just give him a mic, and he'd earn it all the same.__Once Hart is on, he's hilarious; be warned, however, he takes a long time to get under way.__It packs plenty of laughs, which is ultimately what you want out of a stand-up film.__[Not] as strong as such previous dispatches as "Seriously...Funny."__Hart's talents get a great pedestal in this film -- once it shuts up and finally lets him take the stage.__His fans will love it; their main complaint may be that it ends too soon.__His energetic stand-up routine at the Garden can be riotously funny. It also can be frenetic and repetitive. More judicious editing would have showcased his talents better.__The film is flat and lazy, and the audio mix is so low it sounds as if the audience is barely laughing. His cable comedy specials have better production values.__Diminutive and energetic, he exudes comedy with every spirited step and elaborate gesture. He's hilarious, but almost as important, he's self-aware enough to joke about his own shortcomings.__This frantic energy at times touches on genius, at other times suggests desperation. And the directors don't do him any favors by the annoyingly frequent close-ups of audience members in convulsions of laughter.__Some of Hart's set -- including jokes about his security team and an inspired recounting of a disastrous trip to a dude ranch -- is hilarious. And his profane outrage is often funny enough to sell the weaker writing.__None__None
It's difficult to escape the impression that the movie is impressed only with its cleverness.__Once Side Effects gets into its crime story, medication is swept aside by movie nonsense. The storyline goes into tangles that have to be dealt with very rapidly if the audience is not to start laughing.__As a thriller in the Hitchcock mould, 'Side Effects' is great fun: its characters are well acted without being entirely likeable, which makes their jeopardy all the more enjoyable while putting us at a clinical remove.__Soderbergh is less interested in making statements than he is in skillfully fulfilling genre expectations.__A crafty teaser that presents itself as one kind of film before gradually evolving into another kind altogether. I, for one, enjoyed both enormously.__Steven Soderbergh is one of our best and most versatile directors.__Side Effects is a cracking thriller that ranks amongst Soderbergh's best, featuring electric performances by Rooney Mara, Jude Law, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Channing Tatum.__Side Effects virtually demands a three-word review: Just see it.__The main thing to keep in mind while watching Steven Soderbergh's playful new thriller is not to take the movie too seriously or else you'll feel betrayed by the end.__Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns maintain a tone of taut creepiness, but the plot's double and triple crosses are more ingenious than believable.__"Side Effects" does a nice job teasing current anxieties about depression, medical ethics and class striving with the classic thriller quandary of "Who's playing whom?"__[It] will both keep you on your toes and at the edge of your seat.__A stylish take on the psychiatric-thriller genre that, despite progressive narrative absurdities, mostly delivers a dose to the pleasure centres.__In some ways the film is more traditional than you think it will be, becoming a psychological puzzle piece. But Soderbergh lays the puzzle out so neatly, you can't help but be engrossed.__It's a gripping, maddening and thoroughly satisfying thriller, made with artfulness and integrity.__If this does prove to be Soderbergh's final film - and I wouldn't hold my breath - he picked a heck of a one to go out on.__Like a gel cap in a sip of orange juice, the psycho-pharmacological thriller Side Effects goes down easily, even if its long-term impact turns out to be barely discernible.__The movie descends into a TV-grade police procedural, with twists so sharp and a plot so convoluted you may need meds to clear your head.__Side Effects was shot on digital video that makes it look as if we're peering through dirty glass, but it's still a lavishly dread-fueled suspense movie full of twists, reversals, double crosses, and dangerous liaisons.__The film as a whole is consistently enjoyable and sometimes thrilling, a classic Soderbergh showcase for provocative storytelling and marvelous acting.
The latest installment of the slick, highly profitable parody franchise.__It's supposed to be funny, but you'd have an easier time reading a zombie's pulse than you would finding a single good laugh ...__For the art-house crowd, who may, I suppose, stumble drunk into the wrong theater after too much Chardonnay, there are nods to Black Swan and 127 Hours.__A film composed almost entirely of jokes that were much funnier when you read them on Twitter years ago.__Like so much of this whole series, the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious.__Scary Movie 5 must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.__A hate crime against cinema, a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator.__This is the sort of movie where you feel bad for Sheen and Lohan, because they hadn't actually hit rock bottom until they agreed to appear in it.__You know that friend of yours, the one who can't tell even the simplest joke? Watching him struggle for 85 minutes would still be funnier than this movie.__85 or so minutes of random nonsense from filmmakers so clearly dispirited by their mercenary assignment that they seem to be running out the clock from the very first frame.__[A] numbingly inane if cheerfully up-to-the-minute new entry in a franchise presumed to have breathed its last seven years ago.__Put it this way, there's a spoof of "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" in which gorillas throw their feces at the wall to see if it sticks, and you can't help wondering if this is actual documentary footage of the script meetings.__Spoofing movies ranging from Black Swan to Mama to Paranormal Activity, this installment of the profitable series is woefully, painfully unfunny.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Every fantasy creature except zombies get a workout in this overstuffed spectacle about a teenage girl who discovers she has angelic blood in her veins.__"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones" plays like a "Scary Movie" parody.__This desperate Twilight wannabe hits more than its own share of clunky notes.__Every moviegoer will have his own breaking point, when "The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones" surpasses the mundane and enters the ridiculous.__Hollywood has more than enough high-caliber young adult lit to mine. Filmmakers should tap into richer human stories. We mere mortals would dearly appreciate it.__It desperately gathers cliches like a teen fantasy Frankenstein that doesn't realize its secret identity: parody.__Mortal Instruments manages to occupy 130 minutes of frantic, numbing, activity.__Everything chugs along briskly and reasonably entertainingly until running off the rails a bit with a wildly overcomplicated finale.__The action flick is overly long, complicated and, even by teen romance standards, cringe-worthy in its cheesiness.__More than just another watered-down tween franchise wannabe.__Alas, the titular City of Bones is more of a basement.__An almost random collection of sexy-supernatural teen signifiers aimed at squeezing the penultimate dollars out of a declining trend.__City of Bones isn't the worst of its kind, but crap served with flair is still basically crap.__References to "Star Wars" and the Harry Potter and Twilight universes pose less of a problem than the increasingly messy action scenes and an overabundance of main characters, more than enough to fuel several franchises.__Though it has flashes of promise, Bones traces the footsteps of its fantasy film predecessors too closely to blaze anything close to an original narrative.__There are too many characters, and too many of them spend too much time morphing into something else.__A ludicrous, borderline-nonsensical supernatural concoction with a slightly redeeming sense of its own silliness.__It sticks so closely to the YA formula that it feels like a mashup of a watery fantasy with soap opera. Suds overflow.__The fact that there is already at least one sequel planned feels more like a threat than a treat.__On the page, all of these elements may cohere into something distinctive, perhaps through the help of colorful prose. Onscreen, not so much.
A golden comic premise, directed to dross by Ken Scott, who also made the Canadian original ("Starbuck," from 2011) on which this Vince Vaughn vehicle is based.__Softer and schmaltzier than the original. Vince Vaughn has played this guy before, to better effect.__Calling Delivery Man a "comedy" is a bit of a stretch, because it's rarely funny. Dumb, yes, but not in a way that's worthy of more than a half-hearted chuckle.__Delivery Man can be pegged as yet another in a seemingly endless series of Apatow-era man-child redemption stories ...__"Starbuck" was a funny and warm-hearted trifle. So is "Delivery Man."__Vaughn never quite convinces as the perpetual slacker in this blue-collar family (he doesn't even look like he's from the same gene pool) and too many of the characters feel puppeteered into place; you can see all the strings.__Nothing quite seems to fit, as if the movie's been assembled from bits and pieces of other movies.__Delivery Man, with its democratic band of half-siblings and its feel-good view of humankind, is what it is: a reproductive remake that will make you laugh. More than once or twice.__It's all far-fetched, silly and light. But then it's supposed to be.__"Delivery Man" is nowhere near the worst film of 2013, but it is definitely the most exhausting.__Let's just say, whatever your mood going in, you will likely feel a good deal better coming out.__A soggy comedy more focused on stimulating your tear ducts than your funny bone.__The concept's execution is sloppy, full of inconsistencies and plot holes. The situations teeter on funny, but never achieve it. And sections meant to be heartwarming feel lukewarm, far-fetched or inappropriately comical.__[An] overly sweet but heart-tugging comedy.__"Delivery Man" offers a kinder, gentler Vince Vaughn in a pleasantly ramshackle comedy several rungs below his usual fare in both budget and high-concept assault tactics.__The low-key appeal of the original is replaced here by aggressive mugging, a rinky-dink "funny" score, fake uplift and an overall air of feeble banality.__The moral here is that you should never try to learn the identity of your biological father because he might be Vince Vaughn.__It's hard to tell the same joke twice. There's really just one too many offspring in this scenario, and it's Delivery Man.__America has successfully exported the slacker and now is getting him bounced back to us like crabs.__This must be the sweetest comedy Vaughn has ever made, and he's in top form throughout, especially trading barbs with Chris Pratt as his friend and overmatched attorney.
By the time Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro start training for the big match -- it's called Grudgment Day -- you give in because, surprisingly, both actors have reported for duty, especially De Niro.__This one probably never could have been a contender.__Pleasant but underwhelming, it feels like something that belongs on the undercard, never reaching the heights of a main event.__"Grudge Match" at its core is an affront to the cinema gods, an attempt to capitalize off two iconic films for a few cheap laughs.__The jokes are clumsy, the dramatic scenes stale and lifeless; like the climactic bout, the movie itself is a freak show, a fantasy matchup between two icons with nothing better to do than spend down their legacies.__Stick with your memories of Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta, because "Grudge Match" isn't a fight worth fighting.__This is a wretched movie, trading on characters we revere, yet doing nothing to honor them.__The picture itself isn't awful. It's just listless and lackluster with lots of dead air between the laughs.__The underlying premise of Grudge Match is appealing, even if the execution is lackluster.__A match-up that comes about three decades late.__Drab and plodding as a matter of principle.__The result is maybe more interesting than we might have expected, but it's not particularly funny.__[An] overlong, drab, not-so-funny sports comedy ...__Even by low standards, Grudge Match is astonishingly undercooked.__When Razor and the Kid are supposed to be publicly promoting their bout and instead devolve into bickering buffoonery, there's nothing but ill-timed punch lines where the chemistry between Stallone and De Niro should be.__Grudge Match reeks not of ringside liniment and sweat but rather a late-career cash grab for its stars as they exploit far better work done years earlier.__While Stallone (67) and De Niro (70) have done a commendable job keeping their waistlines in check, the vision of the two actors shuffling about the ring in an awkwardly choreographed slapfest is not inspiring.__Remembering the greatness of Rocky and Raging Bull while watching Grudge Match only made me sad.__It's exactly as cliched as it sounds. What's unexpected, however, is the sensitivity and sense of perspective that Grudge Match brings to much of this secondhand material.__"Raging Bull" it ain't -- it's not even "Rocky IV."
This Is Us does what it needs to do for its target audience. But anyone looking for actual substance or insight will be disappointed and maybe even a little bored with its repetitive nature.__The fact is that they are as criminally cute as a basketful of puppies. This Is Us manages to frame that boyish appeal astutely ...__It might not make you a fan of One Direction, but it will certainly make you understand the group, which is the job of any good documentary.__The film is a successful witness to the great charm possessed by all five members of One Direction.__"One Direction: This Is Us" leaves the larger questions it points toward teasingly unexplored, making the film little more than a harmless keepsake.__With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history, it's a shame that a filmmaker wasn't hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional.__Adoring hordes will no doubt devour shots of shirtless head hunk Harry, simmering "quiet one" Zayn and the others goofing on their minders, while nonacolytes will giggle over the Jackass-lite pranks that seem to fill most of their downtime.__It's not that Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson aren't charming and likable. The problem is that the movie offers no way of differentiating them beyond their hairstyles.__For the most part, the movie embraces harmless fun, which can be enjoyable for the audience members, whether they're 1D fans or not.__An airbrushed image of celibate wholesomeness without groupies or even girlfriends, and where evidently nothing stronger than milk passes these young men's lips.__No personal revelations surface in "This Is Us." Also, no narrative, no conflict - no differentiation between band members, even, besides the designation of dark-eyed Zayn as "the mysterious one" (he likes to paint).__A tour documentary that's so streamlined, it could only have been produced by a machine.__One Direction: This is Us is movie fan fare as slickly assembled as the manufactured English/Irish singing group itself.__A reasonably intriguing, if rather sanitized, look at these seemingly likable young entertainers.__Here and there, the faintest glimmer of actual drama presents itself.__For audiences willing to spend some time basking in the glow of the teen sensation of the moment, this docu-music-infomercial is as palatable, and as disposable, as the group's hit songs.__This doesn't set out to be a movie that gets at anything more than making the One Direction guys look adorable, if maybe just a little darker than your average boy-band bunch.__The stage footage, from Madison Square Garden to Mexico City's stadium, has some snazzy allure. The 3-D effects make fans feel like they could reach out and squeeze them.__Essentially a slick, airbrushed promo reel of a bunch of genuinely sweet superstars who can't believe their dumb luck. That's charming. But it's also a little boring. What it's most definitely not is a documentary.__Even calling the film a documentary feels deluded.
All the wonder and surprise of the first movie is gone. It's just aping the violence in other movies and other comic books.__If it works at all, fitfully, it's because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz, who basically carries the entire film on her own small shoulders.__Sequel offers exactly the blend of R-rated nastiness and candy-colored action fans expect.__Even the novelty of a deadly, blasphemous Hit-Girl wears off, and all that's left is over-the-top violence and under-the-belt humor.__What was once shocking now just elicits a shrug.__The year's most unpleasant movie.__The savvy wit and inspiration on display in the first film is absent in this dumbed-down, warmed over retread. Consider its ass kicked.__"Kick-Ass 2" can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up: a vessel for unhinged vengeance and destruction or a meta-critique of those same impulses.__Writer-director Jeff Wadlow establishes a premise and follows it without compromise, but the trail leads to a very ugly place. In the end, the journey wasn't really worth it.__It revels in carnage while lacking the visual style and gleeful humor of the original.__I miss Nicolas Cage.__There isn't anything good to say about "Kick-Ass 2," the even more witless, mirthless follow-up to "Kick-Ass."__Cartoonishly violent, with blood spray, vomit spew, severed limbs, impaled torsos and more, Kick-Ass 2 has none of the punky flair of the Matthew Vaughn-directed original.__It's a smart, edgy, unpredictable action-comedy, the tonal opposite of overwrought sculptures like "Man of Steel."__It no longer seems very smart (the YouTube and texting references are so 2010) and it's also not much fun anymore.__The meta-satire hits you over the head until not just your Spidey sense is tingling.__...an even more pronounced cartoon that maintains the first film's habit of mocking comic conventions while rarely subverting them.__"Kick-Ass 2" has a mean-spirited vigilante streak the first film lacked (it seemed more concerned with justice, in its way), as well as a fatigue.__What seemed edgy and brash in the original film is now routine and old-hat.__A joke isn't as funny the second time around, and maybe especially not if you shout it.
The AIDS epidemic was not a happy-ending story. But it was certainly a test of the human spirit. Ron Woodroof passed that test.__Just about everything is right with Dallas Buyers Club, beginning with Matthew McConaughey's literally transformative portrayal.__A solid biopic is made transcendent by McConaughey, who shed nearly 50 pounds and deserves to gain an Oscar for his ferocious, funny performance.__One of the best films of the year.__A straight-up portrait of a man who figured out a way to cling to life longer than anyone expected and, in the process, learned to let the world in.__Played with raw, rattling fury and grace by Matthew McConaughey, Woodroof is a tarnished protagonist of the first order.__"Dallas Buyers Club" takes audiences back to the worst of the AIDS crisis, where the disease was a death sentence, and the public's terror and hostility were at its height.__Vallee, working from a script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, infuses the film with some humor - Woodroof's posing as a priest as he smuggles drugs from Mexico is a hoot - but he never lets us forget that the stakes are deadly serious.__Once we get past McConaughey's stunning transformation, we're transfixed by a performance that reminds us of why this guy became a movie star in the first place.__McConaughey delivers the performance of his career, characterized not just by an astonishing physical transformation but by a wellspring of deep compassion and fearlessness.__A trio of terrific performers imbues a riveting AIDS drama with heart and mind as well as pertinence.__Dallas Buyers Club" explores an era that's been too-little seen on film: the early AIDS years, when people were dying and helplessness and fear seemed to float in the air.__The movie, based on a true story, shows how empathy has the power to destroy intolerance where it stands.__The simplistic Dallas Buyers Club is worth seeing, if for no other reason than McConaughey's transformative and touching performance.__This is the performance of McConaughey's newly resurgent career.__The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit.__In many ways, the film is all about Matthew McConaughey, and Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee is wise enough to train his focus on the actor.__Does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey.__However creaky this might be as drama, it's a fascinating look at an underground economy and the politics of medicine.__The screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack doesn't yield to pat pronouncements or solutions, refusing to turn Woodroof into a huggable savior, even when his views about gays shift.
An entertaining movie with two solid performances that only occasionally stalls because of its sometimes heavy-handed treatment of Hunt and Lauda's differences.__Considering the subject matter, Rush delivers the expected visceral jolts; what's surprising is how endearing it is, even when its two protagonists are behaving like little more than boys with very fast toys.__The script is another Peter Morgan special. Like, say, The Queen and Frost/Nixon, it's a speculative duet built around a moment of newsworthiness.__If you don't already know the story of that season, lucky you; even now, it exerts a ridiculous thrill.__Rush is an outsize Hollywood spectacle about two outsize personalities in conflict, a sleekly assembled thrill machine that makes up in excitement for what it lacks in nuance.__Rush is not a particularly deep film. But more importantly, it is not a film that mistakes itself for deep. And this self-knowledge makes Rush, in some ways, a wiser film than many that aspire to loftier goals.__Stripped-down characters and skeletal dramaturgy limit this movie about the real-life Formula 1 racing rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, but harrowing track scenes and an affecting second half provide some vivid compensation.__This is a deeply adult drama, not least because Howard shows the costs of being so driven in a sport in which a driver is encased in a potential fireball.__One thing's for sure with this film: You carry the "Rush" out of the theater.__Rush has an elemental simplicity about it. Two men in competition, driven (so to speak) to win. They are enemies. But they need each other, too, and as they roll around at 170 m.p.h., they come to understand why.__"Rush" is the kind of Hollywood studio production that has sadly become all too rare - a smart, exciting, R-rated entertainment for grown-ups that quickens your pulse and puts on a great show.__'Rush' ranks among the best movies about auto racing ever made, featuring two great performances from the leads.__This is no mere thrill ride by two real-life rival speedsters, although it is certainly that. The film also provides a sobering look at what it takes to be a true champion.__The on-track action is blistering, the filmmaking sure-footed (even as cars fishtail into catastrophic crashes), the characters bigger than life.__Howard proves that directing action is one of his underrated strengths. The racing scenes are dynamic and easy to follow, with a sheen that brings the 1970s into sharp relief.__This is entertaining enough, but ultimately it's spuriously triumphant Oscar-baiting fluff.__Hemsworth and Bruhl are outstanding. Their story is what drives the movie, two men different in every way except for their unyielding desire to win.__"Rush," while never dull, rarely feels dramatically alive; it hits its marks dutifully and darts onward.__Mostly a lot of noise and nonsense, a garish enterprise that almost - though not quite - trivializes the tale.__In a way, "Rush" is a philosophical drama about the varying ways men move through the world. It's just a really fast drama.
This is pretty silly stuff, Twi-lite if you will, but played with maximum solemnity, no discernible humor and minimal excitement.__[A] bizarre Saturday Night Live sketch about a girl with a bratty alien inside her.__The Host isn't very good as a romance. There's not very much passion on screen, which makes the film a poor cousin to Twilight.__The movie's structure is awkward. There's no real narrative thrust.__The Host's infelicities-drab dialogue, ridiculous plotting, more emotional crises than there is story-are enlivened by its thematic eccentricities.__Fear and dread of "the other" have long ruled American science fiction, fantasy, suspense thrillers and politics... How jarring then, and refreshing, to see The Host... take the invaders' point of view.__Neither romantic nor fake romantic, and not at all ridiculous, The Host has an atmosphere that is cold, austere and sardonic.__Ronan, youthfully elegant as always, tries hard, but the material defeats her.__A goofball teenage sci-fi romance, "The Host" is an End of Days parable that seems like it was written at a slumber party.__If only the movie played as nicely as it looked.__The Host raises many questions, among them, how has it taken this long for Diane Kruger to play an alien?__Long, tedious and often unintentionally hilarious.__It's a mushy and unsuspenseful melodrama.__Pick up the book. It does a far better job of breathing life into this monochromatic new world than the film.__Dopey, derivative and dull, "The Host" is a brazen combination of unoriginal science-fiction themes, young-adult pandering and bottom-line calculation.__There's only so much value that Niccol's slick presentation can add to Meyer's shallow material.__Ronan is better than the material she's given as Melanie/Wanda. The star of Atonement and Hanna conveys more intelligence than her foolish dual roles call for.__A sci-fi writer like Philip K. Dick ("Blade Runner") might have used this premise to explore notions of memory and identity. Meyer uses it to create a teen soap opera.__During the dull stretches of The Host -- and, sadly, there are many of them -- you may find yourself rewriting the movie as a French farce.__An invasion of the body snatchers is preferable to realizing that the true horror perpetrated here is not on the characters but on the audience.
As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs.__If Wright doesn't quite sustain this astonishing mixture of sadness and silliness all the way through, he gets major points just for attempting it in the first place.__The gonzo side of the plot is not quite as engaging as the human drama, and the scenes in which the characters meet up and try to mesh again are some of the best in the film.__Wright & Pegg continue making the sort of films that the 12-year-old versions of themselves probably always dreamed of being a part of; that sense of joy and practically disbelief that they actually get to do this for a living is right up there on-screen.__The film's strength is its comedic bent - there are some very funny moments contained herein.__Robert Frost famously mused 'Some say the world will end in fire/Some say in ice.' I prefer Edgar Wright's vision: It will end in a pub.__The movie throws itself headlong toward the ridiculous when it begins to live up to its title.__Most of the credit belongs to Wright, whose chaotic style belies the film's meticulous construction.__To my surprise, a diamond has emerged from the gutter. Its name is The World's End, and it'll knock you on you ass from laughing when you're not rubbing your eyes in disbelief.__Although its humor is not for all tastes, no one can say this crazy picture doesn't have the guts to live up to its title.__It overflows with middle-aged angst over lost youth. And laments the generic nature of our corporate-driven culture.__Let's hope Wright, Pegg and Frost concoct more wild doomsday scenarios together. Their work makes for a good time at the movies ...__This is cheeky British irreverence at its best, and there's even a bit of meaning and moral behind it all if you can see through the laughter.__Life's too short to waste your time on this, even if the end isn't near.__Don't feel excluded if you haven't seen the zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead and the buddy cop comedy Hot Fuzz... because The World's End stands on its own as hilarious high-end nonsense.__I pretty much unreservedly loved The World's End, whose compact dramatic structure and steady flow of good jokes puts most mainstream American comedies-too often loosely bundled collections of hit-or-miss sketches-to shame.__Seriously, what's not to like?__The movie shifts midstream ... and never regains its footing.__Wright knows how to keep the energy spinning, but he also doesn't know when to stop.__This inspired nutball comedy is like its heroes on their mission: It just gets progressively more nuts, more blotto.
In the end, 21 and Over is more exhausting - and exhausted - than funny or wild.__One of those brashly formulaic all-night-long youth-party flicks that's redeemed by the speed and personality of the actors.__These guys get into more trouble in one night than members of this film's target audience will encounter in their entire college lives.__All, or at least some, might be forgiven if there were just one likable character or memorable joke.__Among the ingredients "21" is missing: the infectiously random silliness of a Zach Galifianakis, the smug hunkiness of a Bradley Cooper, and any sort of Vegas-y gloss whatsoever.__21 & Over powers along with a winning Abercrombie bonhomie, IE naked guys and racism. Hilarious racism.__21 & Over provides lots of fun while the beer flows. Too bad the R.A. felt like he had to come in and ask everyone about their major.__Lucas and Moore don't bother to come up with a single funny joke. Instead they apparently hope that combining racist and sexist insults with unfocused mayhem will be diversion enough.__Everything is done to excess with the needle on the gross-out meter buried in the red.__This is comedy on a familiar train where every stop is reassuringly predictable.__I don't think I've ever seen someone ralph in super-slo-mo while riding a mechanical bull before, so kudos for originality there, I guess.__A raucous boys' night comedy that goes for the outrageous and hits it often enough.__21 and Over is pretty much for people with an IQ of 21 and under.__A cynical college-age "Hangover" redo with far, far fewer fully developed characters or inventive adventures. (And that's saying something.)__Here is a youth comedy that is leering, offensive, politically incorrect, at times even disgusting, and yet not a bummer.__Bleech. Tasteless. Even worse, unfunny.__You can't hate 21 & Over, and you can't laugh at it. The most you can do is just pity it for not being as outrageous as it thinks it is. And as any guy will tell you, being pitied is the ultimate humiliation.__An alcohol-fueled journey that becomes progressively more farfetched and, as the film's run time ticks on, increasingly unwatchable.__Writer-directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore find a nice balance between the over-the-top high jinks and an emotional core, which unexpectedly crystallizes relatively late in the movie.__This play-it-safe debut delivers, but doesn't exactly surprise, proving Lucas and Moore like their protagonists wasted, but not their opportunities.
Hafstrom tries to pretend his stars are about 40 and, for the most part, it works.__Escape Plan is the newest vehicle for aging action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger and, in this case, it's a lemon or possibly an Edsel.__Try not to think too hard about it, and Escape Plan is stupid, stupid fun.__Schwarzenegger misses no opportunity to be hilarious. How many actors can make you chuckle even when they're being waterboarded?__As Hollywood vehicles for aging action stars go, it's at least serviceable. Of course it's ridiculous, but what else would you expect?__A mildly amusing, if ultimately pointless prison-break thriller from Mikael Hafstrom.__Escape Plan is set in an ultra-modern prison, but it's fossilized entertainment.__All in all, "Escape Plan" does what it sets out to do.__What do aging action stars do in their retirement? Nothing. Because they never retire.__It's not a movie about two old guys who come back, but a straight-ahead action movie meant to be taken on its own terms.__"Escape Plan" is mostly a gray, thudding metal machine of throwback exploitation, but the goateed, goofy Ah-nold is so happy to be in the thick of an old-school bruiser again that he makes it feel like the dumb-fun flashback party it is.__"Escape Plan" doesn't aim high, but it delivers, providing the brute force entertainment values we expect from B movies.__Schwarzenegger seems to be the only one here who correctly takes the film as a lark.__While it's fun to remember '80s popcorn-movie thrills, fully recapturing those thrills might be impossible.__Finally, a Stallone / Schwarzenegger film that isn't completely beneath them.__Just don't get your hopes up.__While predictable and silly, "Escape Plan" is by far the most enjoyable Stallone film in years - it's pure, dopey escapism.__Don't expect this film to restart any careers; if anything, it will remind people why a couple of prominent ones ended.__This latest pairing of the two aging macho superstars actually has a functioning intelligence. And a sense of humor. Oh, and don't worry. Its violence quotient is everything fans of muscle-bound cinema could ask for.__Mercifully free of tongue-in-cheek meta-humor, "Escape Plan" is a likably lunkheaded meat-and-potatoes brawler that never pretends to be more sophisticated than it is ...
As a director, Gordon-Levitt demonstrates considerable technical flair through stylistic flourishes and coaxes great performances out of his co-stars.__Joseph Gordon-Levitt turns the gym-tan-laundry routine into an art form with Don Jon, his vibrant and viciously profane directorial debut.__Offbeat, frank and often surprising gem.__The movie becomes increasingly soft-edged and sappy.__Joseph Gordon-Levitt's debut as a writer-director-actor resembles a porn addict's Groundhog Day, and not in a good way.__At least 80% of it is snappy, droll fluff, while the other 20% is what you get when you persuade Julianne Moore to be in your movie: in a word, better.__Gordon-Levitt's characters feel real and "Don Jon" is a convincing, authentic, funny, modern romance.__Really, "Don Jon" could have - should have - gone on another 20 minutes. Then again, when was the last time you felt that about a romantic comedy? Or any movie?__The movie has a keen understanding of how easily we can hurt other people by not considering them.__Who would have thought one of the most amusing and oddly insightful romantic comedies would be built around the power and the potent pull of porn?__Gordon-Levitt enlivens Don Jon with such a sense of swagger, as a director, writer and actor, that the film feels fresh.__Gordon-Levitt keeps things riotous for the film's first hour, and if he eases into an ending that's a little Hollywood-standard, after having so much fun tweaking form and content, I'm guessing audiences will cut him some slack.__[A] deceptively sincere movie about masculinity and its discontents that Mr. Gordon-Levitt, making a fine feature directing debut, shapes into a story about a young man's moral education.__By the time Jon learns that "you have to lose yourself in another person" (a nice turn of phrase), it's too late for us to lose ourselves in the movie. "Don Jon" is already gone.__Writer/director/star Joseph Gordon-Levitt takes an intriguing subject - human attraction - and nimbly probes it with wit, insight and a disarming forthrightness.__R-rating aside, it should be required viewing for every 15-year-old boy on the planet.__Rarely has a film offered such raw and honest talk -- with visuals, too -- about male sexuality.__The film manages to be extremely efficient, conveying its points, making the audience laugh, getting viewers invested and even breaking our hearts in just 90 minutes.__An overheated disquisition on the pleasures and limitations of masturbation.__Joseph Gordon-Levitt's writing/directing/starring debut is like its diamond-in-the-rough title character. It shows a lot of unrealized potential, with enough charm to ease you past its shortcomings.
Since every funny moment here involves cynicism, arrogance, heartlessness, and self-destruction, you never believe the movie when it's telling you how nice and contrite these characters are.__The true comeback story in this fictional comeback story doesn't belong to a character named Burt Wonderstone, but to an actor named Jim Carrey.__This comedy about a magician who must hit bottom before rising again to the wonder of his beloved craft pulls plenty of sweet moments and a slew of laughs out of a story that might have been thin air.__This may be the kind of semi-bad, semi-inspired comedy that could not only stand repeated viewings but perhaps improve with them.__A generic, fitfully funny mainstream comedy that doesn't nearly get the best from its name-brand players but doesn't qualify as a desecration, either.__A veritable festival of bad toupees and repeated gags that just lie there, "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' runs a bit more than an hour and a half but seems much longer - like it had been edited down at the last minute.__The Incredible Burt Wonderstone isn't.__"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone" isn't incredible, but it's a nicely performed bit of programmed Hollywood hilarity.__... has its share of engaging-to-great bits, including, truth to tell, one gag performed by Carrey that made me laugh louder and longer ... but it falls kind of flat as a complete moviegoing experience.__It's as if Carrey has been waiting, through a series of bland and corny showcases, to find a role that doesn't derail or divert his intensity, but embraces it.__Burt Wonderstone is a lazy, underwritten imitation Will Ferrell movie.__It's a long, limping slog from the halfway point to the finish line, even if the actors have built up enough goodwill by then that it's bearable to coast the movie out.__No amount of smoke and mirrors can hide the burst seams, frayed wires and bad-hearted humour of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.__Perhaps it's a magical disappearing humor act that afflicts this throwaway.__"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone" can't transcend the fundamental problem built into movies and television shows about magic. It isn't really magic if you're watching it second hand.__Did the producers appeal to a denominator even lower than common by making their film as dumb as possible, or did it just turn out that way?__There are some funny bits and characters around the edges of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, but its core is empty of humor.__Calling it "The Mildly Diverting Burt Wonderstone" would have been more accurate, but how many tickets is that going to sell?__[It] fumbles so badly that you can almost make out the flop-sweat on its brow.__Magicians have been pulling rabbits out of hats for ages. And yet, with all this talent, no one can make a decent script materialize.
It's not the sheer predictability of the ensuing frolics that's hardest to take, or even the dismal attempts at humour ... but the sheer misery of watching actors you once respected demean themselves in such utterly worthless fodder.__Barring a few off-color jokes, though, the movie feels like a Carol Burnett sketch dragged out to feature length.__It's tired and dated with too few laughs to justify the stultifying attempts at drama and the impossible-to-swallow plot contortions.__Looks great, some terrific ingredients, but when you slice it up, what a disappointment.__Sarandon, Keaton and De Niro mesh beautifully, fully convincing as a trio of old friends and carting in lots of characterization that would be otherwise lacking in Zackham's rote screenplay.__For all its surface amiability, The Big Wedding might be one of the more frustrating films of the year.__The Big Wedding is a would-be screwball comedy that forgets to throw in the screws.__Many Hollywood films are founded on privilege, but few are as open and nasty about their racism, misogyny, and homophobia. It's a feel-good movie for people who only comfortable around people who look and act just like them.__The Big Wedding aims low and achieves every aspiration.__I suppose it's always nice to get an invitation but please, this "Wedding"? Send back your regrets.__A shining example of a dull studio comedy.__It never feels real, and its only saving grace is that it clocks in at a mercifully short 90 minutes, which is just about the amount of time you need to realize you never want to see these characters ever again.__"The Big Wedding" doesn't have a single moment of recognizable humanity.__Sadly, superior talent can propel a movie only so far. Bad scripts beget bad movies, even when four Academy Award winners are involved.__It's a mess, and not in a good way.__Like many big weddings - a lot of things go wrong and not much goes right.__This movie plays like an episode of "Gilligan's Island" done as straight as an episode of "Lost."__The screenplay is chopped up into smutty sound bites constructed around the notion that casual obscenity delivered by respected actors of a certain age is hilarious. But it's just embarrassing.__A game cast and lots of gamey R-rated shenanigans can't compensate for the silly comic contrivances that dominate The Big Wedding.__It might take a glass of champagne or two to get through The Big Wedding.
Glorious vision of youth and truth, love and loss, your name is Mud.__An evocative highlight of the American movie year so far.__Sadly, Nichols, who made the superb Take Shelter, gets mired in mood this time around. But there's still an evocative sense of childhood exploration, and a gritty performance by Matthew McConaughey.__For at least three-quarters of the way, this is a fine film, and one that kids and parents could see together.__There is an enchanted-fairy-tale aspect to Mud, but its bright, calm surface only barely disguises a strong, churning undercurrent.__A modern fairy tale, steeped in the sleepy Mississippi lore of Twain and similar American writers, and with a heart as big as the river is wide.__Nichols has a strong feeling for the tactility of natural elements-water, wood, terrain, weather.__Nichols takes his time with the story, dwelling on how the boy is shaped by the killer's tragic sense of romance, yet the suspense holds.__"Mud" isn't just a movie. It's the firm confirmation of a career.__"Mud" unfolds at its own pace, revealing its story in slivers. The performances are outstanding, especially from Sheridan, who plays tough, sweet, vulnerable and confused with equal conviction.__The film is drenched in the humidity and salty air of a Delta summer, often recalling the musical, aphoristic cadences of Sam Shepard, who happens to appear in a supporting role.__A wonderful, piquant modern-day variation on "Huckleberry Finn.''__One of the most creatively rich and emotionally rewarding movies to come along this year.__It's a movie that holds out hope for the movies' future.__Mr. Nichols's voice is a distinctive and welcome presence in American film.__Nichols' wild narrative tributaries all eventually intersect, and at no time does he let one's attention stall.__What you do need to know is that the acting is top-tier all the way. McConaughey, on a career roll, is magnificent.__Mud has the feel of a novel ... that's rooted deep in American soil. Yet it was written specifically for the screen by [Jeff] Nichols, who has conjured up a coming-of-age story set in the South that doesn't resort to using caricatures and cliches.__Nichols lovingly sketches his characters and their world; he takes his time doing so, but it's a pleasure to watch the small interactions and the humid reality of secret coves and Piggly Wiggly supermarkets and seedy hotels.__Writer/director Jeff Nichols creates richly realized characters in a tale that moves like a cottonmouth viper, advancing slowly until it strikes with sudden violence.
Patton is best at contagious bliss. She might be the best at it. When she smiles, you smile. You want her to have what she wants even when how she wants it is stupid.__A romantic comedy so light and brainless you almost expect it to float away.__Man, "Baggage Claim" is terrible.__Nothing in this movie would actually happen, so what's irritating is that it presents itself as a savvy, "Am I right, ladies?" dating commentary.__"Baggage Claim" is so archaic in its depiction of feminine self-worth-and, frankly, so insulting-it's amazing that it's coming out in 2013, not 1963.__A painfully predictable romance, and a terribly unfunny comedy.__A shrill, embarrassing comedy that insults the female audience for which it is intended.__Paula Patton is one of those actresses who seem to light up the screen whenever they appear, but even her considerable charms can't quite make Baggage Claim tolerable.__Paula Patton puts on the well-worn shoes of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts, ending up with a predictable vehicle perhaps best left in lost and found.__It would have worked better if the silly premise had been played for farcical satire, rather than following the cookie-cutter rules of the romantic comedy playbook.__Convoluted, predictable, and mostly unfunny ...__Predictability and cliches get in the way of comedy here, especially with a lead character who rarely comes across as more than blandly sweet.__Baggage Claim is the lost luggage of rom-coms.__Benign but hopelessly dumb, "Baggage Claim" tries to spin the staples of romantic comedy into a mad tea party (its perfect suitor is named Mr. Wright), but lacks the energy and edge.__Glossy, flossy and blithely secure in its own cheerfully fake worldview, "Baggage Claim" bypasses the intellect entirely, happy to satisfy on a silly, screwball, wish-fulfillment level.__The results are so forgettable - and, yes, fake - it hardly seems worth the effort required to criticize them.__There's little chance of finding realism or romance, but the laughs are there.__Takes the bold position that women aren't truly fulfilled unless they're on the arm of a good husband, a notion that's been ridiculous since cavemen stopped dragging women around by the hair.__For a chick flick that meets the first two criteria of the Bechdel Test (it has at least two women who talk to each other), "Baggage Claim" fails the third (about something besides a man) big time.__Patton, who excels at projecting confidence and cool, can't seem to get a handle on the movie's insecure heroine, and overcompensates with broadly cartoonish gestures and facial contortions.
The movie lacks the nerve to treat death as anything more menacing than the tooth fairy.__Markus Zusak's enormously successful young-adult novel seems to have been adapted as a movie for middle-aged children.__"The Book Thief" may not be perfect, but it may steal your heart.__Pretty visuals give an unexpectedly painful twist to other parts of the story.__You just wonder if this film's audience might be happier at home, curled up with a book. "The Book Thief," perhaps.__A tale of WWII Germany as seen through the eyes of a young girl, "The Book Thief" is unobjectionable, sentimental, and not a little dull.__Given the tough-minded tone of many young adult books turned to films, "The Book Thief's" frolicsome tone feels dated and inappropriate.__Screenwriter Michael Petroni has done a first-rate job of adapting Zusak's book. Director Brian Percival's pace is sometimes leisurely, but the small moments are important, and the ending is quietly memorable.__And so another awards season brings another film (adapted from another international bestseller) offering up the unrelated and uncontroversial lessons that reading is good and Nazis are bad.__A misfire in far too many meaningful aspects, The Book Thief is so bad that it's tough to decide whether it's better used as a sleep aid or watched while under the influence as an object of derision.__The Holocaust has never looked so beautiful.__Has some wrong notes and touches of preciousness, but mostly it's a moving and effective presentation of life under Nazism, as seen from an unusual angle.__With superficial sleekness, it flattens the intricate story to excessive simplicity.__Gorgeous photography and a potential new star in 13-year-old Nelisse, but this is the rosiest view of Nazi Germany since "The Sound of Music." Without the music.__The movie tries heartily to contain writer Markus Zusak's myriad plot points, but the result is a rushed conclusion, which tempers the intended tear-jerking climax.__If you can't do a thing right, sometimes it's best not to do it at all. Thankfully, "The Book Thief" gets more right than it doesn't.__Fortunately for Percival, he cast the right actors to guide us through this tricky terrain.__The narrative rushes through Nazi book burnings, Kristallnacht, the roundup of Jews and Hitler's fury over the Olympic triumph of Jesse Owens, a surface treatment of major events that barely conveys the horror of the times.__This plush, mawkish period drama, adapted from Markus Zusak's 2005 best-seller, might be useful as a means of introducing the Holocaust to small children, but it's indefensible on almost any other terms.__"The Book Thief" tries so hard to warm our hearts amid grotesque suffering, it goes a bit mad under the strain.
What Cianfrance has written has scraps of surprise and a fine chase sequence, but it doesn't reach for the stars or the emotional cosmos -- or, at least, it doesn't know how to get there.__This naturalistic drama is ambitious to the point of being unwieldy... But once the story has advanced from one generation to the next and its thematic sweep has become apparent, these flaws seem much more tolerable.__"Pines" is hardy stuff, but it's at its toughest when Gosling's on screen.__The Place Beyond the Pines is hackneyed and dull: Not a single moment rings true.__This is a story about legacy, the sins of the father, the restlessness in our souls. It's powerful, it's bold, it hits you hard.__Cianfrance and his sterling cast keep it all together, vanquishing doubt and soap suds. There's a palpable sense of teamwork that brings out the best in all of these players.__Its three stories are so loosely connected, its themes so scattered -- morality, justice, fate, fatherhood -- that it never manages to make a point.__"The Place Beyond the Pines" is an ambitious drama about the ways in which one bad decision can reverberate across generations.__Carefully observed and consistently compelling, it feels like an instant American classic, if a minor one.__With the arrival of The Place Beyond the Pines, the American dramatic film has found a loyal, gifted advocate in director Derek Cianfrance.__As the sum of some admittedly imperfect parts, "The Place Beyond the Pines" still manages to cast its own haunting, sorrowful spell.__[A] thoughtful and often powerful film ...__With more than 50 speaking roles, the film easily could have sprawled out of control into a predictable epic. But "The Place Beyond the Pines" holds enough intimacy - and surprise - to satisfy.__Cianfrance hasn't figured out what he wants to say, but he spends a lot of time and energy trying to say it.__Fine, fine, it's an epic. Now let us up for air, please.__You watch what happens, often dreading the worst. Even when the worst comes, though, it comes with honor and a kind of grace.__"The Place Beyond the Pines" earns every second of its 140-minute running time.__If there are better films this year, then we are in luck. If it opened in December it would seem a major event.__The movie is intimate in its telling, sweeping in its issues and stumbles only occasionally.__Its ambitions - even its unrealized ones - are a great part of its power.
I can barely remember who lives or dies. I barely cared.__The screenplay for this violent retro schlock was written by Sylvester Stallone, and the movie feels like something out of the early eighties.__'Homefront' just isn't the Southern-fried smackdown it should have been__The deeper we go into this story, the more ridiculous the coincidences and plot twists.__Everyone cast against type. Everyone breathtakingly bad, reciting dialogue by Sylvester Stallone that begs for a "mute" button.__By making Statham a regretful lawman, it neutralizes his main talent, effectively neutering him. It also telegraphs the kind of mostly watered-down movie we're about to see.__Stallone plopping Statham in this bore feels like an alpha setting up his successor to fail, like Zeus swallowing up his challengers before they force him into retirement.__Homefront aims to be retro, greasy comfort food but despite its lowly ambitions, there's barely enough spice here to merit a decent burp.__There's something almost refreshing about a movie that delivers exactly what's expected of it.__[It] isn't Statham's best - or most brutal - work, but it's not bad.__Homefront is ridiculously overdone.__Ryder rockets to such heights of emoting that she looks like she could black out from lack of oxygen.__There's little in the way of character, visual style, or suspense.__The basic ingredients of a throwback action movie are all there; what's missing is action and style.__[Statham's] paired with a precocious adolescent daughter and an adorable kitten that only accentuate his charm.__"Homefront" is hard not to like and impossible to respect.__The worst sin is visited upon Statham: Sure, those fists fly, but his poetry has become a chopped-up hash.__Pardon me, "Homefront," but I'm having a little trouble finding James Franco, as a bayou meth lord, to be much of a match for Jason Statham, as an ex-DEA agent hiding out anonymously with his daughter.__For one brief moment in "Homefront," you will think: This is going to be awesome.__The entertainingly one-note Statham tossed together with chronically versatile James Franco-in a movie scripted by Sylvester Stallone, no less.
It's a local-government corruption thriller that doesn't care about logic or consistency or the people watching it.__Somewhere in here there's a cogent, timely attack on the links between business and politics.__If you're in the mood for some slick trash featuring great actors slumming it without phoning it in, "Broken City" is a crackling good time.__Most of the roles are so ambiguous you end up scratching your head in the final reel, and some of the loose ends are so irrelevant they seem to have ended up on the cutting-room floor.__What follows is not a review; it's an autopsy...one long (illustrated!) spoiler.__The picture comes out swinging with both a conscience and a set of brass knuckles; it also features a Russell Crowe who doesn't, thankfully, sing. What's not to love?__Crowe, so tanned and coiffed that he looks like he belongs on a copper coin, plays the mayor as a boss out of the '40s, a heartless string-puller who thinks he owns the city.__[An] overproduced, underobserved, yet agreeably twisty new political thriller ...__Did these people - or even these people's people - not bother to read the script first?__It is not that Broken City -- boasting a cast worth big expectations -- is bad, exactly. But it is deeply mediocre. When they say television dramas are getting the better of the movies, this is the sort of middling outing that proves it.__Broken City is one of those movies in which characters keep reminding you that nothing is what it seems, and sure enough, there's more going on here than mere infidelity. But the audience is hard-pressed to follow exactly what it is.__The film is a collection of crime noir oddments that don't add up to a full meal.__When any film works, it's a miracle; when it doesn't, it's this.__A more-than-pleasant change from the month's parade of horror films and trash comedies.__Like the film's shady mayor, "Broken City" is a little too slick for its own good.__There's rarely a believable moment ...__You may want to account for low expectations, but the crime drama "Broken City" turns out to be much better -- and funnier and more suspenseful -- than both trailer and release date portend.__While Broken City is hardly revolutionary, it's a slyly entertaining cop saga that leans more heavily on acting and dialogue than gunplay and chases.__In the end, Wahlberg knows what he needs to know and takes sober satisfaction in a job well done. And the audience knows everything, too, but is less satisfied.__Few, if any, of the characters are believable and the twists the story takes are telegraphed well beforehand, or fairly guessable. Much of the plot gets bogged down with excess exposition.
Beautiful Creatures is like the Twilight movies but with a chaperone making sure the boys dance a foot apart from the girls.__'Beautiful Creatures' is stylish, campy fun at times.__The movie is claimed ... by narrative incoherence, Tim Burton-envy and the usual demons of digital effects.__This surprisingly beguiling attempt to blend fantasy, coming-of-age drama, melodrama, camp and social critique isn't always successful - but it's nearly always entertaining.__A dash -- only a dash -- of Tim Burton ghoulishness might have helped.__This fantasy about witches and warlocks walking among us was clearly produced for the Twilight crowd, but a witty script and the enjoyably hammy performances from Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons broaden its appeal.__Beautiful Creatures rests entirely upon the shoulders of leads. And in that sense, it completely works.__As supernatural types, Oscar winners Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson overact so strenuously and with such outrageously awful Southern accents that you fear the damage this crock may do to their reputations.__Within the needlessly complicated script and CGI special-effects overkill, there are some promising moments.__Beautiful Creatures is good fun and I want to know what happens next for Lena the teenaged witch.__A clear bid to ignite a franchise capable of filling the hole left in teenage hearts by the end of the Twilight saga.__The original young-adult book had even more going on, but filmmaker Richard LaGravenese has tried to simplify it. Even so, the movie's mythology seems confused if not outright contradictory.__If only we could hope that Beautiful Creatures would stick to a single film or a maximum of one sequel, before its modest charms wear out.__...a new vision of witchery that is more playful, coherent and intelligent. If you're thinking a deep-fried, more hormonally charged Harry Potter, that's not it, but it's close to the intention at least.__Beautiful Creatures tries terribly hard to establish its own mythology of magic and witchcraft and Southern-fried adolescent angst.__A movie so schizoid in its extremes of pleasure and pain that it's hard to know how to weigh its contradictions, or even where to begin separating them.__Beautiful Creatures is an oddball creation: a morality play with no basic understanding of morality.__In the end, "Beautiful Creatures" is lacking in the one element it most needs: magic.__The comedy defuses and deflates the drama, frustrating those who would be swept away by belief.__This is silly stuff, but powerful all the same.
The actors hit the jackpot, but only in terms of their paychecks. The audience gets a tension-free, tight-assed, Casino ripoff that leaves them thoroughly fleeced.__The mannered speech is fun, the players are charismatic, and director Brad Furman maintains an agreeably brisk pace.__It looks like everybody's lying, and that's only because the acting is pretty bad.__The movie mostly wants to look timely and seem topical. Instead, it feels irrelevant.__Various subplots are given short shrift and the whole thing feels more like a Cliff's Notes version of a longer piece than an actual finished motion picture.__You want the movie to get outrageous, but it's too dignified to go there. Much like its central villain, it can't decide what it wants to be.__Takes us inside the world of Internet gambling which proves every bit as fascinating as you'd imagine, by which I mean, not at all.__He's back! Behold, the second coming of .&#8201;.&#8201;. Badfleck.__You see "Runner Runner's" hand before it's played, and there's nothing to keep you playing.__The film will make a decent rental in a few months time. But to lay down good money now, to see it in a theater? That's a chump's move.__After an intriguing setup, Runner Runner devolves into a by-the-books thriller.__"Runner Runner" is less than mediocre, but it's not repellent, which means that to watch it is to root for it - and to be disappointed.__Even with Affleck doing his Rat Pack best, by the end of "Runner Runner," the chill is gone.__"Runner Runner" is a bummer. Bummer.__Runner Runner is a run-of-the-mill rise-and-fall story, treating its hero to fabulous, exotic luxury before tugging the rug out from under him.__The movie is like a set-up to a set-up.__It feels like a halfhearted bluff and has the stale smell of yesterday's after-shave.__Even with its glossy Costa Rican setting, Runner Runner is a vacant excursion with plot holes the size of a small Caribbean island.__Here is a film in which a man is covered in chicken fat and thrown into a pit of crocodiles, and you still can barely keep your eyes open.__Even when you have no clue what they're talking about, you know exactly where the movie's going and can pretty much tell from your watch how and when they'll get there.
Given its title, you can be forgiven for assuming that Adam Wingard's home-invasion thriller will be just another blood-soaked body-count flick. But You're Next is better than that. A lot better.__By slasher standards, the writing is good, with interesting turns and surprises. And the acting isn't bad, either, though Vinson is the one to remember.__Fairly routine brunette-fighting-for-survival stuff with a liberal dose of dark humour.__Home invasion thrillers seem to come along every five minutes... Kudos then to indie director Adam Wingard for kicking in with some fresh ideas.__Maybe, in another time and place, and with different actors and a better director, it might have worked. But this thing collapses right from the get-go.__Satisfies the expectations of Midnight Madness gore hounds - and then it happily goes about exceeding those expectations.__A well-executed horror-comedy ...__Most of these characters are disagreeable, so the prospect of their imminent demise isn't too upsetting.__A wickedly clever play on the genre that takes you by the scruff of the neck and drags you through 90 minutes of the most inventive mayhem, murder, and pitch-black comedy you're likely to see this year.__Although there's a twist in this tale, most of it - the brutal home invasion, the anonymous creeps in spooky masks - is stuff we've seen before. And Wingard doesn't think of a new way to show it, either ...__This uninhibited slasher movie has sick-joke humor and variety -- it's more of a hack, chop, slice, dice and puree film.__Injecting the home-invasion thriller with fresh DNA, Adam Wingard's "You're Next" strays just enough from formula to tweak our jaded appetites.__A film of repetition, a bloody dance consisting of three steps: stab, scream, repeat.__It clicks as an exercise in suspense and well-paced, slowly unfolding answers.__A clever, genuine and crisply chilling take on terror that should appeal to cinephiles and Saturday night popcorn-throwers alike.__A taut, garish gut-wrencher about a family attacked by masked gate-crashers, it's presented with audacious mastery of its pulp material.__A smart, feral flick with a wicked sense of humor.__"You're Next" draws on the home invasion/haunted house scenario, but outclasses [other films] with its wit, irony, and technically proficient terror.__The film begins as an utterly routine horror flick with all the usual musty tricks, but that's just rope-a-dope. The expectation of stupidity makes the cleverness to follow stand out.__Wingard does pull off a few stylish setpieces: He is clearly talented. But the movie, which was shot two years ago and has been kicking around the film festival circuit since then, feels dated and trite.
The film's scant plot plays second fiddle to Hoffman and Harwood's nuanced exploration of love so long unrequited.__Dustin Hoffman's directing debut about retired musicians in the third act of their lives has a winning, classy charm for older audiences.__The first thing to note is that Hoffman has apparently had a grand time working with these professionals, all of whom as residents of the home are splendid.__"Quartet" is one of those movies that looks so effortless, it's easy to forget just how much could have gone wrong.__'Quartet" is a lovely little charm bracelet of a film, a fairy tale for the geriatric set blessed with a wonderful cast and a carry-on attitude.__Hoffman, in his directorial debut, has crafted a hopeful movie with a warm atmosphere, but one that's realistic, too.__The premise may sound insufferable, but this light comedy about a nursing home for retired classical musicians isn't half-bad.__Whatever his imprint on the film might be, it's overshadowed by the performances of its stellar, veteran cast, to whom Hoffman wisely gives ample rein.__Stay for the credits; they're a lovely, poignant reminder of the passage of time, and of lives spent immersed in art and music.__Hoffman directs with elegance, allowing the denizens to be dignified, as well as adorable. We get a strong sense of each major character.__Always cute and breezy, "Quartet" often forgets that its protagonists are in a sobering stage of life, and that there's comedy to be found there as well.__In his first attempt at directing since Straight Time, Hoffman makes this bauble shine by buffing out some of its sentimentality.__Quartet shows us how art illuminates our lives, and shows us artists and performers who can still, after all these years, do some illuminating.__Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut is simply an old-fashioned charmer, relying on the considerable talents and charms of its seasoned British cast to win you over.__Hoffman trusts his actors, and directs this thoughtful comedy with a sure hand.__"Quartet" is about what happens when a performing artist's physical gifts start to fail with the years; whether acceptance or resistance is the wisest response; where to put one's pride. The movie just couches these issues in a cozy love story.__The material settles for amiably familiar observations about the difficulties of growing old and the glories of being surrounded by beautiful music.__It has a good heart. I'll give it that. Maybe what it needs is more exotic marigolds.__Masterpiece Theatre comfort food, a chance to watch fine actors act without too many complications.__Quartet is a bit shameless in its approach, but for those who enjoy a whimsical drama that includes scenery chewing from grand dames and hammy fellows, it's a welcome if often predictable treat.
At the heart of the problem with this movie are matters of logic and cogency.__The many strands of this amiable yet overstuffed romantic comedy don't hang together, though each, on its own, has a modest charm.__What is most distressing about Admission is that it serves as further evidence that Tina Fey, despite her dominance of the small screen, has not yet mastered the big one.__This is certainly an interesting idea, though the movie is badly handicapped by Fey, who must venture beyond her usual snippiness into scenes of genuine poignancy and proves unequal to the task.__Granted, this is not automatic laugh-riot material, nor should it be, but didn't Fey recognize how hackneyed it all is?__If Fey ends up making movies as good as this one over the next few years, television's loss will have been cinema's gain, for real.__You'll be glad you enrolled.__This would be a good movie for a parent to watch with a high-school-age child facing down the college admissions slog-it's mildly snarky but resolutely uncynical.__Some films are electric - Admission settles for alternating current.__When in doubt, ma'am, just ask yourself: What would Tina Fey do?__In their central roles, Rudd and Fey have a natural, unforced chemistry. John and Portia are cute as buttons, but they're also goofy, confused and flawed people.__Only Mr. Rudd emerges unscathed. He protects himself by being consistently affable in the face of heavy odds.__Everybody in "Admission" is funny - Tina Fey, Paul Rudd, Lily Tomlin, Wallace Shawn - but they're not funny in "Admission."__While most college-themed comedies aim for low-SAT yucks, "Admission" tosses out jokes and cultural references that aim higher.__Admission settles for skin deep.__A genial, predictable and ultimately forgettable romantic comedy.__Cheerful, skittish entertainment that never takes its subject seriously enough.__Fey and Rudd achieve a couple of comedy mindmelds ... but they're fleeting, as Admission's outlandish contrivances continue to get in the way.__Infused with an almost relentless blandness, it's defined by soft comedy (a few laughs here and there), flaccid drama, and likeable actors.__You could call it a dramedy, I guess, but that manufactured term suggests a blending of the two elements. Here they exist almost as separate genres squeezed into the same movie.
[Payne has] made an "American Gothic" for 21st-century, post-recession America. Who needs a pitchfork anyway, when you can have an ice cold bottle of Bud?__The deft achievement of this movie is that it has a hardness that doesn't delight in the meanness of mockery as the Coens often do.__An intimate road movie about one family that also lingers on the landscapes and fabric of an old-time, dying vision of the American Midwest__"Nebraska," it turns out, isn't as bleak as it first looks.__A desolate comedy-drama about fathers, sons, life's highways and missed off-ramps.__"Nebraska" is a wonderful comedy shot in black-and-white and told in shades of gray.__One of the best films of the year ...__Payne remains a deeply humanist filmmaker: He loves people no matter their flaws, and he once again conveys that sympathy through a beautiful, haunting film that initially feels slight but grows large in your memory.__Sad? At times. But also very, very funny in other instances.__In a career-refining performance, Bruce Dern gives us a character in Woody Grant who's hardened by booze, hard to like and -- if his bad-dad tendencies don't cut too close to your bone -- pretty durn amusing.__The pain and hope and sense of loss are all there in Dern's eyes, in Woody's stolid willfulness, his shaky gait.__There's no lying or condescending from this director. "Nebraska" feels pure.__Alexander Payne has crafted an ornery American comedy with a brusque Midwestern edge and a core of authentic feeling. It provokes wise, wary laughter even as it makes you choke back tears.__It's ideal material for Alexander Payne, a director with great affection for the interstate.__Payne has never before been this melancholy, or this sincere. Nebraska looks into America's soul and finds a troubling emptiness.__Nebraska is the work of a great director hitting his stride.__It has moments of uncanny grace, made all the more beautiful by their dryness: a family, briefly, pulling together; a son suddenly understanding his father's dream; a tiny moment, at the end, of unexpected triumph.__"Nebraska" bears Payne's trademark combination of low-key humor, poignancy and an overall feeling of Beckett-esque resignation.__I said that Alexander Payne makes no mistakes, and that is true here. This is a road picture, but beautifully self-contained and sure-footed.__Payne, shooting in widescreen black and white with cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, elevates the material with images, simply composed, of serious and paradoxically ordinary beauty.
Overall, it gets by, but bets are hedged when single-minded efficiency and ice in the veins would have been enough.__A cool, violent, efficient adaptation of the taciturn anti-hero (the creation of Donald E. Westlake, writing as Richard Stark), who's out to restore order in a bloody world in his own bloody way.__For an old-fashioned crime thriller, you need real pros. Mr. Statham is to acting what Taco Bell is to nutrition.__Poster quote: "Parker," a film that's a little better than you'd expect!__Parker's vengeance isn't thrilling, there's a pointlessly developed non-love triangle, even the glam settings look cheap, and the tough-guy exchanges are inexplicably flat.__Hollywood hasn't butchered Parker-which is to say that it has let him remain a butcher.__Although working with material that is lackluster even by his standards, Statham manages to demonstrate a commanding screen presence that cannot be dismissed.__"Parker" winds up with the worst of both worlds: It's pointlessly violent and nauseatingly cute.__You can use electricity to make ice, which is pretty much what Statham does in Taylor Hackford's jaggedly satisfying thriller, Parker.__A formula action movie that hits its formula marks as if no one expected more. I do expect more. So do Westlake fans. This Parker spits in our collective eye.__The movie is a morals-free procession of bang bang bang! and blood blood blood!, and men slamming each other with blunt objects and slicing each other with blades.__The action scenes are crisply directed, brutal, and invigorating. There are several of them and, in the aftermath of two, Parker is left a bloody mess.__Though Parker starts off fairly strong, the action gets more predictable as it meanders toward its conclusion.__Under Hackford's direction, there is more to "Parker" than explosively staged action sequences (though there are plenty of those).__It's made with such skill and smarts that it stands above such eye-rolling blow-'em-up fare as Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Last Stand.__In a world of pumped up, hyped-up action stars, Statham is one of the few who looks like a genuine man of action. Like Parker, he gets the job done. And then he moves on.__Hackford struggles to find an equivalency for Westlake's spare, hard-boiled prose.__"Parker" should have stayed parked.__"Parker'' is watchable chiefly for Statham, who exudes effortless cool and excels in hand-to-hand combat, as well as demonstrating his skill at wielding some very unlikely weapons.__Screenwriter John J. McLaughlin has rendered a faithful adaptation of "Flashfire," one of the 24 novels filled with Parker's meticulous schemes and personal machinations.
These are the subjects that Holofcener does exceptionally well -- the myopia, vanity and insecurities of the moderately privileged.__Enough Said is Nicole Holofcener's best yet - it's what we wanted from the new Bridget Jones book, a smart comedy about dating in your 50s.__Enough Said is a romantic comedy about hurting the people you love, who you want to love - and making mistakes that may be impossible to recover from.__In the terse space film provides, Holofcener capturing her characters deftly. We know their fears, needs, lonesomeness. We trust the cars they drive, the food they eat, the rooms they keep tidy, or not.__What a concept -- an adult romantic comedy that's equally wise and playful, with mold-breaking performances by James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.__The easy chemistry between Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini is wonderfully charming - you're rooting for them even as the falsehoods pile up and the poison begins to flow.__The jarring shifts between effective drama and failed humor make watching Enough Said a bumpy and sometimes frustrating journey.__For all of us who've been waiting way too long for a smart, funny, snappy romantic comedy for grown-ups - here it is.__Holofcener delivers her most confident character comedy to date - a work of deceptively informal mastery - and Gandolfini's gentle performance just about breaks your heart.__A small-scale movie made much bigger by achingly good performances from Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini in one of his final roles.__I can't say enough about the way "Enough Said" keeps its scintillating sense of humor as it grows deeper and more affecting.__Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini have made only a handful of films in recent years, and they're delightful together. They contribute lived-in, vanity-free portraits of fully realized individuals hoping against hope for a new chance at lifelong love.__Something in the combination of Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini doesn't seem right, or perhaps it just doesn't look right.__Feisty, funny, fizzy and deeply wise, "Enough Said" sparkles within and without, just like the rare gem that it is.__"Enough Said" is a precious little jewel of a movie.__What makes this material work so well is the chemistry between Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini; the terrific scene in which they embark on their first date is delightfully awkward and amusing.__Louis-Dreyfus manages the difficult trick of keeping us engaged with her character, even while driving us crazy. She's never been better.__Despite the movie's limitations, it's very satisfying to watch Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini enjoy each other's company on screen, as characters, because it's satisfying to watch them enjoy each other's company as performers.__Holofcener elicits relaxed and relatable work from the entire cast, and she displays a strong ear for the patter of upper-middle-class passive-aggression.__Gandolfini's achingly honest work is at odds with the rest of Enough Said, which should have been titled Not Enough Said.
Time and again, Stewart squanders the opportunity to do anything remotely interesting or worthwhile ...__There's little to fear from this rather tame genre outing.__Dark Skies is sort of supernatural, but it's really more super natural....[it's] about the fragility of family, a muted meditation on how precious it is.__Stewart has some lofty ambitions, some of which he almost fulfills.__Those elements are employed with consummate dexterity.__Dark Skies is a bore that even the most forgiving genre buffs will find difficult to defend or endure.__It's not that Dark Skies is so awful you need to be warned away from it. It's just that it's so bland you might as well find something better to do.__Really the biggest problem with Dark Skies is that Stewart can never quite decide just what story he is telling or whether to focus on this character or that, instead struggling to string together scares regardless of how they fit together overall.__The movie builds a moderate, if less than monumental, level of spookiness, regardless of your ignorance. It's a workmanlike piece of suspense.__A pretty good buildup to OK payoff without any real surprises en route makes Dark Skies feel just enough above average to make one wish it had one memorable spark of conceptual inspiration up its sleeve.__A smart little chiller, one that can be read as a metaphor for the American family in crisis during tough economic times or merely as a tense exploration of things that go bump in the night.__It's a generic repository of everything that's currently en vogue in commercial horror: a PG-13 haunted-house movie with body possession, lots of digital shocks, and some of the surveillance-cam creep of the Paranormal Activity series.__Sci-fi and horror fans know to keep watching the skies - but they won't be missing too much if they decide to skip this.__Mostly ... it all ends up feeling like a lost, minor episode of "The X-Files:" A little scary, a little silly and catnip for those who want to believe.__Dark Skies is an alien-abduction thriller where the biggest acts of appropriation involve the lifting of plots from other - and often better - films.__Writer-director Scott Stewart doesn't want to play his hand too early. By the time the movie is over, it's easy to see why he kept his cards close to his chest. He's not really holding anything.__None__None__None__None
It's filthy, nasty, sexy, absurd, appalling, and exhilarating, and it succeeds as a musky union of novelist Cormac McCarthy's bleakness and Ridley Scott's sense of chic.__A great writer's pompous idea of pulp fiction, treated with stultifying seriousness by everyone else involved.__Each scene serves as little more than an index card for the mechanistic plot, which Scott films in a glossy and fluid style befitting an industrial promotion for the movie's high-tech weaponry.__The Counselor is the cumbersome end product of a high-minded writer trying to slum and a slick director aiming for cosmic depth.__It's not so much a bad film as it is a disappointing one. A very disappointing one.__It's like a mumblecore movie about a bunch of Sarah Lawrence philosophy majors, made by coked-up rich people for 100 bajillion dollars.__Novelists don't always make good screenwriters-this is the first film for which McCarthy has written the screenplay himself-and The Counselor's nihilism soon becomes tedious.__Movies can be like undercover cops: They become too enamored of the worlds they explore.__The action is all but blatantly telegraphed, even as McCarthy keeps shuttling his characters around from Amsterdam to Mexico.__The Counselor [is] a droning meditation on capitalism in the form of a thriller about cocaine trading on the Tex-Mex border.__The film seems an hour longer than it is, with too many scenes that go nowhere.__"The Counselor" is guilty on all counts.__Sexy, complicated, smart, violent. Cool.__It contains memorable dialogue, vivid characters and several superb scenes, and yet it still manages to be wrong, a complete miscalculation.__Considering the deep bench of A-list talent involved, Ridley Scott's new Southwestern noir, The Counselor, is a jaw-dropping misfire.__Nearly every plot twist is telegraphed by reams of stilted dialogue provided by novelist Cormac McCarthy in his first original screenplay.__As cold, precise and soulless as the diamonds that figure briefly in its plot, "The Counselor" is an extremely unpleasant piece of business.__An uncommonly erudite thriller built around the pulpiest of stories.__Everyone's speech is awash in gaudy psycho-blather and Yoda-like observations.__Mr. Scott's seriousness isn't always well served by the scripts he films, but in Mr. McCarthy he has found a partner with convictions about good and evil rather than canned formula.
It's a film whose plea to the audience resembles Jobs' appeal to the crowd in that iPod-unveiling scene: "Believe this is important and exciting," it asks, "because I say so."__The irony is that a man who treasured innovation and sleek, stylish design should be the subject of a film that's so bland and bloated.__Other than people who are mildly curious about the guy who put the smartphone in their pocket and the tablet computer in their knapsack, I'm not sure who "Jobs" was made for.__Jobs is the equivalent of a feature-length slow clap.__A missed opportunity.__Like the man it's about, "Jobs" is thin and unassuming, but keeps surprising you with ideas and innovation.__If Jobs had been a producer on Jobs, he would have sent it back to the lab for a redesign.__The performance at the center just isn't up to the job.__He was a charismatic leader, and the greatest salesman the industry ever saw.__There's a void inside the man that Kutcher never manages to fill.__After a while, you don't care.__The movie itself, ultimately worshipful, ends up being Jobs-like in the cold way it treats flesh-and-blood people.__At its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good.__Not that the real man's career wasn't marked by conflict, but does Jobs have to be such a drag?__It seems like an extended Apple ad, with a few gossipy asides, but less entertaining.__A blandly superficial treatment of a deeply complex man.__It's a daring performance that instantly undermines Kutcher's pretty-boy features and makes them seem ugly and brutally uncompromising.__[A] merely serviceable film ...__It's an American success story of epic proportions, but Joshua Michael Stern's biopic of the Apple co-founder is hardly epic.__"Jobs" turns out to be the IBM PCjr of biographical dramas, hampered by creaky formatting and thinking entirely inside the box.
Michael B. Jordan is simply brilliant in his portrayal of Grant, whom Coogler presents as a generally happy, if complex and somewhat troubled young man.__The intimacy of debut writer-director Ryan Coogler's approach to the film and the no-frills, believably real quality of the main performances combine to drive the senselessness of Oscar's killing home with visceral impact.__Writer-director Ryan Coogler's [film is an] assured and evenhanded debut.__It's hard not to watch Fruitvale Station with a coiled dread... Yet, Coogler's greatest achievement may be in reminding us that Grant was a work in progress with people who loved him in spite of his flaws and because of his hopes.__You wonder if Coogler would have felt freer had Grant somehow lived that night, if the director weren't put in a position where he felt the need to honor the dead by bringing him to dramatic life. But he believes in his ambition.__We feel the death on the platform so acutely not because it's a stupid act of randomness, but hardly untypical racist violence, but because we've come to love this man.__Michael B. Jordan (The Wire and Friday Night Lights) plays Oscar with the heart and compelling charm required to make us feel close to him.__It's a story of one young man's tragedy, a story that resonates with so many other tragedies. Oscar Grant wasn't some mere symbol; this film makes him flesh and, unfortunately, blood.__An eloquent memorial for a man who barely experienced life, and a haunting reminder of how quickly it can be lost.__Empathy and authenticity keep you on the edge of your seat at Fruitvale Station.__Some of this narrative feels cliched, but Coogler and his actors make it work by leaning toward understatement.__"Fruitvale Station" isn't just a story of one family's tragedy, but a wounding snapshot of a society struggling somewhere between melting pot and battlefield.__It's a film to make you weep with sorrow and anger, and one of the most necessary films of the year.__Whatever role prejudice have played a part in the shooting - Oscar and his friends were black, and the officers were white - Fruitvale Station refuses to turn the incident into a statement on race and divisiveness.__Coogler immerses the viewer in Grant's world, creating empathy for his struggles while also examining the realities that limit his options.__Fruitvale Station sums up Oscar's life, but the act of summing up can tell us only so much, since a young life is still a maze of promise and indecision.__By using a fly-on-the-wall approach, Coogler is able to tell his story in a straightforward style that gets the message across without seeming preachy.__In naturalistic and unforced strokes, he allows Grant to exist as a complex, even contradictory human, inviting the audience simply to sit with his life, his loss and what they both meant.__Fruitvale is easy to see as something more than a movie - a diagnosis, perhaps, or a part of that sticky vortex we call the zeitgeist.__Oscar Grant had friends, he had a sister and a mother and a grandmother, a girlfriend, a child. In concise measures, Fruitvale Station shows us these connections, these bonds.
Even in a work of science fiction like this, Gleeson seems beyond real. All those foam-faces being made in the dark? They're for him.__Some people will revel in this warm front of innocence; others will reach for their Voltaire.__There's a lot of comic and fantasy potential here, but much of it gets squandered.__To get to the parts that are un-terrible, you have to suffer through the most idiotic plot developments and ill-defined characters imaginable.__You may as well check your cynicism at the door, because Curtis & Co. are going to find a way to trample all over it - adorably.__With more attention to detail, this could have worked, but the time travel aspects are so badly executed that the movie as a whole falters and eventually rips apart at the seams.__The film takes few of the liberties you'd expect from its genre, and it conforms to an internal logic throughout.__It's all so perfect and sparkly that Curtis would rather not break the mood with drama or plot.__Perhaps, like me, you find the oeuvre of British writer-director Richard Curtis a bit -- how shall I put it -- twee?__The latest sprawling romcom/family drama from Richard Curtis way outlasts its charm.__A soap opera of babies, poignant moments, minor crises, and lessons about savouring each day.__The script is so willy-nilly about the complexities of the issues it introduces that it winds up collapsing.__A mostly charming romance, leavened by deft comedy, interesting sidelights (there are a few wonderful jabs at the world of the British theater) and a lovely cast.__For moviegoers who can't fathom any situation worth $10.50 to witness everlasting love, steer clear of "About Time." But the drama offers something for almost everyone else ...__For all its glutinous cuteness, damn if "About Time" doesn't sneak up and sock you in the tear ducts. I tried not to fall for it. I failed.__By the time you get home from the multiplex, it will be as if the whole thing never happened.__It likely won't top the box office of such previous Curtis enchantments as Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral, but like most soppy encounters, it'll do.__Nighy makes it all OK, or mostly.__Time travel can be a nifty device for stirring and complicating romantic drama.__A pleasant, gentle comedy about learning to love life; about enjoying every moment, even if you have to play it over twice to get it right.
By the time the kamikaze crows start dive-bombing the church windows, and the shape-shifting demon appears in a hoody and a Venetian carnival mask, the whole thing has degenerated into a mumbo jumbo gumbo.____A generally effective sequel.__Once the "what is real, what is fantasy" questions are answered, and exorcism part deux commences, The Last Exorcism Part II abandons its half-intelligent, tender exploration of Nell's vulnerability and desirability.__When the creators of The Last Exorcism Part II swapped pseudo-verite realism for psychological realism, they made it a lot harder to take their franchise seriously ...__Viewers are taunted with the possibility of witnessing a possessed chicken.__The Last Exorcism Part II is an effectively unnerving, slow-burn supernatural horror tale.__Now Bell can break out of the genre. She's served her time.__Without spoiling anything, I will say that The Last Exorcism Part II ends on an open note that teases a legitimately engaging setup for a potential third movie. But really, the producers of this series should quit while they're behind.__Unfortunately, no one involved seems to have bent over backwards to make the movie either original or even all that scary.__An abysmal sequel that abandons the found-footage concept, along with the pockets of wit and originality that made its predecessor salvageable.__This matter-of-fact, brick-by-brick approach to building scares and tension probably won't work for audiences who just want to scream a lot, so Gass-Donnelly undercuts it all by haphazardly tossing in jump scares of the cheapest, most predictable kind.__An actress who suggests religious piety, carnal fire and satanic aggression with equal dexterity, Ms. Bell provides a pulse an audience can connect with amid the standard-issue atmospheric accouterments.__Creepy atmospherics don't compensate for the lack of genuine scares in this unimpressive follow-up.__A sure-handed sequel, but not a terribly thrilling one.__None__None__None__None__None
The movie is too calculated to shock. Korine just wants to be the danger he's warning us about.__It's campy and comic at times, but Korine also gives the film a downbeat, melancholic edge, with voiceovers, pointed repetition of dialogue and images, and hallucinatory camera work, sound and editing.__Neon bright and all raw energy, Spring Breakers is a pulsating paradox of a movie, both a tangerine dream and a cultural reality check, a pop artifact that simultaneously exploits and explores the shallowness of pop artifacts.__Korine's story is a searing indictment of today's hedonistic, nihilistic youth, and his script is loaded with sharp, telling dialogue that exposes the rotten moral cores of its characters.__The film stands, overall, as one of the director's richer provocations ...__Once a year, St. Petersburg is awash with thoughtless, unpleasant people making poor decisions. This spring, Korine is one of them.__An authentically cracked expression of the crazy, conflicting signals bombarding today's teenagers.__Korine gestures toward social criticism, but essentially this is just an hour and a half of bongs [and] beers... thinly dressed as Natural Born Killers.__Having fun has rarely felt this dangerous.__... 'Spring Breakers' is a gas to look at and to hear, and it's easily Korine's most successfully sustained work."__A half hour, four hours, two days after walking away from it you might still flashback to its seductive, neon-lit, dayglow world.__A mash-up of last year's teensploitation opus Project X, Pulp Fiction, Natural Born Killers and a Girls Gone Wild video.__"Girls Gone Wild" meets "Natural Born Killers" with a chaser of social satire.__Korine is tap-dancing so fast that it's never really clear exactly what he's up to, but none of it adds up to much in the end.__Korine likes the poetics of transgression, and he trowels on the bad behavior with a heavy but mesmerizing hand.__What should be infuriating makes sense in the context of the director's twisted cinematic rulebook.__In another movie, these girls would be sex objects. In Spring Breakers, we're all too aware of what lurks under the pretty packaging.__It may be irritating, but "Spring Breakers" is like a sunburn we can't help scratching.__Starts out like a salacious, rump-centric and blithely bare-breasted hip-hop video and ends up in the realm of scary and inspired trash.__A candy-colored fever dream is the most unforgettable movie of the year so far.
Isaac's folk-singing Llewyn Davis may be an arrogant loser and the butt of a cosmic joke but he's something more than a cartoon. So is the movie ...__This is one of the strangest yet most satisfying movie experiences of the year, one of those films in which you can't really appreciate what you've seen until it's over. You just have to trust that the trip is worth the trouble. And it is.__The broad, black humor of the Coens' early features has ripened over the years into a sadder, more philosophical brand of comedy (A Serious Man) that puts them in a class with Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch (yeah, you heard me).__The Coen brothers have crafted another unique period piece.__Celebrating and mourning a bygone moment, "Inside Llewyn Davis" is a tuneful wake intended to arouse us from our slumber to desires worth remembering.__You don't end up rooting for Llewyn Davis because there's not much to root for. And this imparts a weird sort of impersonality or cold-bloodedness to the film's core.__In the end you feel Llewyn's pain even as you realize he is a pain. Llewyn Davis is nobody you'd want to be inside.__Inside Llewyn Davis plays like some beautiful, foreboding, darkly funny dream.__"Inside Llewyn Davis" is a transporting cinematic experience with a churl at its center, and how you feel about the movie may depend on how you feel about the churl.__This soulful, unabashedly lyrical film is best enjoyed by sinking into it like a sweet, sad dream. When you wake up, a mythical place and time will have disappeared forever. But you'll know that attention - briefly, beautifully - has been paid.__If it weren't for a single forced, cheap scatological gag, I'd call this the Coens' most nearly perfect film.__Isaac, who also shared the screen with Mulligan in "Drive," may remind some moviegoers of the young Al Pacino. And like Pacino, he has a gift for being appealing even when he's unpleasant.__When the Coen brothers commit to something, there's no half-stepping. Every street corner bristles with authenticity. Every song lands exactly where and how it should.__Inside Llewyn Davis is one of the Coens' smallest movies - this one doesn't have the broad appeal of True Grit or No Country For Old Men - but like Llewyn's music, it comes from the heart and is deeply felt. It is also one of their best.__The whims of fate and vagaries of artistic success have never been so clearly defined, or so musically.__It's about a sensitive, confused young man in desperate pain, negotiating an identity crisis during an important moment in American cultural history.__It never becomes more than one scene, followed by the next, and then another. Yet those scenes are easy to watch, and they have the Coens' signature humor.__Some quibbles. But it's well worth seeing.__There's not much of a plot to speak of, just a piercing, evocative sense of a time and place and the characters contained within it.__The sad-funny story of a stubborn, talented Greenwich Village folk singer becomes a stunning, tragicomic paradigm of an artist's struggle in America.
The weaponry is so ridiculously bountiful that the movie must be a defense against something. But it's just another lousy action movie. And for more than an hour, it's less than that.__The movie's tongue in cheek humor will buy off most of the target audience. And Arnie? He's indestructible.__Schwarzenegger can still hold the screen, but these days he grinds through his one-liners like a truck driver taking a steep hill ...__The result is diverting enough for a low-expectations Friday night, but the ingredients were in place for something more.__Not the most iconic choice for Schwarzenegger to announce that he's back, but not one that's completely prefab, either.__Just bold enough, brutal enough, and dumb enough to feel like a return to form.__Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) handles the action sequences effectively if not spectacularly, though The Last Stand could have dispensed with the occasional attempts at sobriety and cut straight to the chase (or chases).__The script is a mess, built on lazy cliches, stilted jokes and easy payoffs. What the movie does have, though, is enthusiasm.__Slapdash in its character portraits, the movie is slambang in its action scenes; it springs to life whenever it promises death.__To call "The Last Stand" gratuitously violent is to pay the movie a compliment. It's sort of the whole point.__Dig just a shade beneath the surface, trade in the text for the subtext, and a more interesting picture emerges - a little richer, sadder, almost poignant.__[Kim] can't disguise the fact that Schwarzenegger, playing this seen-enough sheriff, doesn't so much look world-weary as simply tired.__[It] just seems to want to gin up a lot of high-fiving for a lot of shooting, and right now is the least palatable time I can think of for that.__It persistently tries to drag the audience down to its mindless level.__Proceeds to interpret classic Westerns like High Noon and Rio Bravo in the vein of proudly cartoonish violence.__For sure, The Last Stand is no Terminator, but it is a fun, if predictable, action-thriller.__"The Last Stand" is the movie equivalent of an idiot who, to avoid scorn, starts acting like an even bigger idiot, so as to get in on the joke, too.__Sorry, big guy, but making small talk with the locals at the diner just isn't you.__By the end, even Schwarzenegger looks worn out. Maybe being governor wasn't such a hard job after all.__The movie isn't about eloquence, it's about giving Mr. Schwarzenegger a chance to take on new enemies that include advancing age.
Aims for Bruce Springsteen with its blue-collar big themes and stadium-rock emotion but ends up as a bandana-wearing cliche.__This is a movie that might have been a great drama at four hours with a more ambitious script and a director with a vision or something to say.__The movie has an undeniable, dour force, but it's basically conventional macho filmmaking, and it's extremely violent.__Good actors really earn their pay when they have to negotiate bad scripts.__A down-and-dirty revenge picture whose classy cast elevates it above its gritty, grimy trappings.__One of the best movies I've seen this year.__We're supposed to take this more seriously because it takes itself more seriously.__If the downbeat plot is depressingly familiar, it's partly salvaged by the quality of the performances.__Grimy and unapologetically melodramatic, Furnace pounds out a steady beat of pulp, violence and possible redemption among folks who have seen better days.__Yes it has a fine cast, and all do good work. But this overly obvious film about the downward spiral lives of lower-class brothers barely scraping by in life goes through mostly expected motions.__Although Out of the Furnace takes place just a few years back in this new millennium, Scott Cooper's solemn, blood-soaked drama about brothers and broken dreams feels like it's of some different, ancient time.__Out of the Furnace is a boozy, searing portrait of disenfranchised people trying - and not always succeeding - to eke out an existence. But the movie celebrates their struggle and makes you share their scalding pain, like molten steel on bare flesh.__This is fire-breathing melodrama masquerading as social commentary.__A long, grim exercise in garden-variety pointlessness, disguised as nihilism.__You know where it's going, but the actors make the trip worth taking.__It's Bale, and his almost biblical quest for justice, who burns his way into your soul.__A somewhat formulaic Rust Belt noir, but Bale delivers a visceral, go-for-broke performance as a man who puts family above the law.__"Out of the Furnace" offers a bleak vision of America's rural economic woes before flattening out into a routine thriller about good men doing bad things.__[An] unusually deliberate but otherwise predictable drama.__It has everything a viewer would expect when Hollywood goes blue-collar...But Furnace is saved by a couple of surprises and mostly by the performances from its big-ticket cast.
Suppose Armand Assante had played the mother, not as a father, as a mother. Suppose Isabelle Huppert had taken the Colin Farrell part. This may be no more than playful, but heaven knows Dead Man Down needs as much of that as it can get.__A way-too-leisurely thriller whose destination is fairly obvious from early on, but to which the talented cast apply themselves with effortful seriousness.__Explores a common ground for noir thrillers before stumbling and imploding in a climax that feels like it might have been hijacked from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.__While a mob thriller can be as nasty as it likes, what it can't be is silly.__More a dark fairy tale about vengeance than the action-packed crime thriller it purports to be, the film is at times exhilarating, bold, and beautiful -- when it's not busy being ludicrous, fragmented, and just plain stupid.__It takes forever to get going, unspooling its hopelessly convoluted, unwieldy plot for so long that it loses whatever marginal narrative momentum it possesses.__Dead Man Down is a very serious thriller featuring very serious stars being very serious about the seriousness at hand.__This blend of Scandinavian gloom and Hollywood hokum never jells.__Yep, there's a whole lot going on here, but this is one of those plot-heavy scripts that carries its weight with confidence - the intricate twists don't cheat.__Perhaps if Farrell and Rapace and Oplev had all stayed in Europe - and tried to do a similar script, with half-as-much firepower, and twice as much brainpower - they might have had something worth watching. Instead it's just something worth ducking.__The film has been directed in a murky, rhythmless fashion by Niels Arden Oplev, who directed Rapace in the original, and terrific, Swedish-language The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.__A moody twist of hyper-violent vengeance and heartache where death is hand-delivered, mercy is hard to come by and love is never easy.__A derivative collection of brazen plot holes and latenight-cable cliches.__The cautionary adage about weaving tangled webs in the process of deception certainly applies to Dead Man Down, an overwrought thriller brought to ground by its own contrivances.__As a gritty thriller, Dead Man Down doesn't stand out among its bullet-riddled brethren.__The movie might have been better if its Swedish director, Niels Arden Oplev, had played with the genre cliches stuffed in this turkey instead of going for straight-up action.__It's all so much turgid brooding, dialogue underlined with import, and leaden symbolism involving Rapace's white and red dresses, none of which is salvaged by a typically understated Farrell performance.__In the end, a viewer can do little more than appreciate Dead Man's shimmering look and wish all involved better luck in their next endeavor.__The screenplay by J. H. Wyman is squirm-inducing in its preposterous dialogue and haphazard plotting.__That crack cast still keeps things involving, especially Rapace's emotionally and physically disfigured Beatrice.
It's all you can do not to laugh. Oh, go ahead. But be forewarned that there are many miles to go before we get to the end and it will feel like an eternity before any of it makes sense.__If movies need us to suspend disbelief, you have to supply your own clothes hangers for Getaway.__This latter-day B movie can be rather fun in its preposterousness and bargain-basement style.__Getaway is pretty much a 90-minute car chase. That's it.__The only participant to emerge with its reputation intact--though not its paint job--is the Shelby Mustang muscle car, which also delivers the film's most nuanced and psychologically complex performance.__Getaway has some of the crass trappings of a charmingly crass, go-for-broke action pic like the delightful Crank. But it's too dumb - and far too cynical about what audiences want - to even know how to have fun with them.__It may be the dumbest movie released this summer.__For 89 minutes that feel like 89 hours, cars speed out of control and crash doing only PG-13 damage. The damage to your brain while watching it is incalculable.__Don't be alarmed if you walk out of Getaway feeling confused. It's not you. This grainy, clustered video game of a movie makes no sense.__By the time the movie actually arrives at its finest moment - a nearly two-minute single shot from the Mustang's hood as it chases the villain's van through dense traffic - you've become so numb to speed and sensation that you may barely notice.__Director Courtney Solomon doesn't know how to shoot action; his herky-jerk style is a constant distraction and never lets momentum build.__You've probably seen this movie before, watching a child play with his toy Hot Wheels cars after eating multiple bowls of sugary breakfast cereal.__After a while it all becomes mind-numbing. How many chase scenes and car crashes (they do all start to look alike) can one person take?__One can only guess why Ethan Hawke felt compelled to make a high dive from the sublimity of "Before Midnight" into the twisted rubble of "Getaway."__If you can't even deliver blatant car-nography, what's the point?__It's hard to remember another action entry that expends so much energy on frenetic blacktop choreography and attention-deficit editing with so little to show for it.__Getaway might have been enjoyable as a mindless bit of dumb, late-summer entertainment if it had been vaguely coherent.__[A] video game posing as a movie, a preposterously plotted kidnapping story starring a high-performance Mustang.__"Getaway" could have been an excellent two-minute film.__"Getaway" is so bad that what's most surprising about it is that Nicolas Cage didn't manage to star in it.
Hill's eye for back alley scuzz is as strong as ever, but the story, adapted from a French graphic novel by Alexis Nolent, is so die-cut it gives neither him nor Stallone anything to work with.__On its own degenerate terms, the movie works.__It's a series of fight scenes that build to a climax that is surprisingly unsatisfying in the way it ultimately plays out.__Sylvester Stallone shoots people in the face. That's it for subtext in this formula action swill. Why do I sound like I should expect more. Because the credits list the director as Walter Hill.__Bullet to the Head doesn't try to adapt its star to 2013. It just pretends that we're still living in 1986. And for 91 minutes, it just about works.__Stallone can still be entertaining, but here he's got no character to play, nothing fun to say, and the craziest hair/hairpiece/scalp growth this side of John Travolta.__The Geritol action genre lumbers on in the lackluster "Bullet to the Head," starring Sylvester Stallone, or at least a beef jerky replica.__In "Bullet to the Head" violence is abrupt, shattering and consequential. It's not for laughs. It's graphic and unsettling, and it makes us feel uneasy, as we should, about the world the characters inhabit.__All sorts of blockheaded action thrillers rolled into one, with occasional mentions of "flash drives" so you know it's not actually a script from 1986.__Entertaining if nonsensical ...__Plays like such a floundering exercise in macho overcompensation that you almost feel sorry for it. Almost.__"Bullet to the Head" is an adrenaline shot to your movie memory if the blunt, gleefully dumb, no-nonsense ways of '80s-style action flicks are your nostalgia drug of choice.__By the end I could have used a Bulleit to the mouth.__[Its] sole redeeming quality is that it ends. Eventually.__No one here seems to notice that there's not much going on, including Mr. Stallone, which somehow makes it easier to watch.__The plot fails to deliver a single surprise ... and the characterizations are thin even by the standards of the tough-guy genre.__The magic is in the details, from the little surprises to the colorful casting.__Bullet to the Head indicates that we're rapidly approaching an era of big-bang movies with stars on mobility scooters.__It's just director Walter Hill tweaking his formula from the "48 Hrs." franchise.__Cut together like a beer commercial on poorly lit cheap video without much panache.
its dramatization of a U.S. dream team's journey to the international showcase is leaden with predictable character types and storytelling cliches, neither of which its well-executed but oddly infrequent dance sequences are able to overcome.__The actual dancing scenes are occasionally electrifying, if far too sparse, but other than that and the welcome sight of co-star Chris Brown getting clocked in the face, the film barely gets off the ground, much less sticks the landing.__A dead-in-the-soul cash grab of a movie set in the competitive world of B-boy dancing that thinks cliches, phony melodrama and product placement can substitute for real storytelling and actual characters.__Battle of the Year clearly features lots of brilliant dancers, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy watching them move. But you wish there were more dancing here.__Should satisfy the planet of b-boys and girls to whom it thoroughly preaches, while amusing anyone else who simply can't ignore the promise of an all-corn buffet.__The 3-D is a pain, and the excitable editing, slo-mo and speeded-up action frustrate attempts to watch the athleticism on display ...__The miracle of the new 3-D dance film "Battle of the Year" is how it can be so relentlessly boring while there is so much frenetic activity on screen.__The raison d'etre of popping-and-locking scenes is trumped by tired team-building bathos, whose flagrancy is anything but conducive to spreading the film's hug-it-out bro-love.__The story is a derivative quilt, patching together cliches from every sports movie since 1976.__This 3-D spectacle is less the dance movie that's going to make b-boying cool again than a shill for sponsors' gear.__At the risk of sounding 100, I think it's regrettable this film had to be shot in digital 3-D.__A frenetic mess that makes Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloolook like a Fellini film.__Battle of the Year is too inept to make this tired premise sing.__If you can get past the mountain of cliches and poor acting and hackneyed story lines and the fact that someone let Chris Brown be in a movie, "Battle of the Year" is actually ... still pretty awful.__Fatally frontloaded with endless training montages, awfully written, indifferently acted drama, sports-film platitudes and jaw-dropping product placements that only the hardiest of viewers will make it through to the payoff.__Chris Brown gets punched in the face, so it's not a total wash.__Everything about Benson Lee's predictable dance flick "Battle of the Year" strikes me as old.__Destined to please only bad movie buffs desperate for a fix of awful dialogue, blatant product placement, and clunky exposition.__It's undeniable that the good-natured "Afterschool Special" vibe here plays to the film's corny strengths, and the dancing is impressive. So much so that it's almost impossible not to cheer during the final round.__The dorky, jingoistic charm wins points just for daring to dress the team in red, white and blue Kangols while the judges scream, "Korea strikes back with an aerial assault!"
Despite all the gross-out humor, the most offensive thing about this is the lazy filmmaking; every shot feels like a first take, and the haphazard editing precludes any comic timing.__It is utterly disgusting throughout.__As a film critic, I've seen nearly 4,000 movies over the last fifteen years. Right now, I can't think of one worse than Movie 43.__How many directors does it take to screw in a star-studded piece of aggressive stupidity and call it a movie? An even dozen, and there is no punch line.__The line between gross-out humor that's inspired and the kind that's witless is fine indeed, and "Movie 43" obliterates it with poop and movie stars.__"Movie 43" is the "Citizen Kane" of awful.__Deadly dull, unfunny, offensive, and stultifyingly clumsy.__Movie 43 is a near masterpiece of tastelessness. The anthology of 12 short, interconnected skits elevates the art form of gross-out comedy to a new height.__Once you're attuned to the movie's desperation to shock, you begin to have that jaded, ho-hum feeling.__You won't believe how tiresome bad taste has become.__Farrelly and his brother are two of my low-comedy heroes, but Movie 43 is amateur hour.__Your laugh mileage may vary (God forbid), but we can all agree on one thing: this is the biggest waste of talent in cinema history.__Some movies should be reviewed; others should simply be warned about. Movie 43 is now showing at theaters and drive-ins everywhere. Beware.__I see a bright future ahead for this sui generis work, which will be passed around sixth grade classrooms by odd-smelling kids for years to come.__[A] gauntlet of smutty, profane awfulness ...__If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous Howard the Duck, Gigli, Ishtar and every other awful movie I've seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn't begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of [Movie 43].__Movie 43 is gross, juvenile, disgusting, scatological, vile, reprehensible and in the worst possible taste. But heaven help me, I laughed.__An awesome array of talent doesn't prevent this witlessly profane anthology of comic shorts from being an utter disaster.__A gaping wound on the side of cinema, a January release that's yearning to be hidden from audiences, the ugly stinking maw of a Hollywood system that thinks you're an idiot.__None
Even those familiar with the history will be impressed and moved to see these events as Mandela experienced them, before the Nobel Prize and universal adulation recast the past in a glow of inevitability.__Nelson Mandela gets the Classics Illustrated treatment with this handsome, undemanding biopic.__The life of Nelson Mandela is simply too big, too complex and too important to be contained in one movie.__Elba has long been better than the film roles he's been offered, a tradition that continues with his leading role here.__You keep wishing, as "Mandela" plays out, that this were more than one movie.__Aside from some youthful randiness early in the film, it wouldn't be out of place at a state funeral.__This movie begs to be compared to epics such as "Reds" and "Gandhi." But while Elba embodies a dignified hero, the film itself is less than revolutionary.__[A] conventional, high-minded, rather pedestrian movie ...__There will one day surely be a great film about Nelson Mandela, one that shows the man in all of his glory as both revolutionary and peacemaker. Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom isn't that film.__There's so much crammed into this 139-minute movie that it often leaps from one event to the next too swiftly to make much of an emotional impact.__Though it's a story we've heard so often that we perhaps take it for granted, seeing all the events of this remarkable journey laid out for us in a two-hour and 21-minute feature underlines its not-to-be-believed qualities.__Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom does a worthy job of honoring both its subject and its audience.__Elba may not look...like the South African leader, but his sheer presence makes you believe he is channeling him. Still, [it] falls frustratingly short as a cinematic experience, trying to cram too much of Mandela's colorful life into too little time.__[A] vibrant, engaging film adapted from Mandela's 2000 autobiography.__The restrained intensity of Idris Elba's performance as Nelson Mandela ennobles this ambitiously sprawling biopic.__Unfortunately, this reverent and old-fashioned biopic is a prime example of the kind of inspirational movie that is, itself, uninspired.__A conventional biopic made anything but conventional by the magnitude of its subject's life and accomplishments, and by Idris Elba's imposing performance in the title role.__Superior acting aside, "Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom" feels like a film you watch because you should, not because you want to.__At almost 6 feet 3 inches, [Elba is] too big for physical similitude, but big enough in dramatic presence to measure up to his character's courage and moral stature.__Maybe Mandela is one of those historical figures whose life is greater, more larger-than-life, than any mere movie could ever do justice to.
This is a universal X-ray of bourgeois love, one that in a few decades will get around to something like Amour.__Hawke and Delpy remain as charming as ever, and their combined goofiness is more endearing than annoying.__Love is messy here, life cannot be controlled, satisfaction is far from guaranteed. Romance is rocky at best. But romance still is.__Though "Before Midnight" is often uncomfortable to watch, it's never less than mesmerizing - and ultimately, a joy to walk with this prickly but fascinating couple again.__"Before Midnight" is heartbreaking, but not because of Jesse and Celine. It's the filmmakers' passions that seem to have cooled.__Before Midnight is fascinating to watch, and so long as Celine and Jesse are communicating, there's still hope.__How (Jesse and Celine) try to rekindle that flame is what drives Midnight, a film that feels so authentic it's like overhearing a conversation you're not sure you should be hearing.__Having created and aged into their characters, both Delpy and Hawke are superb at doing what professional actors find so difficult - not seeming to act.__Offers a remarkably intimate and provocative study of a marriage.__Lovely. Insightful. Sad. Funny.__If the first two films belong with the greatest (if talkiest) movie romances of all time, the new film is richer, riskier, and more bleakly perceptive about what it takes for love to endure (or not) over the long haul.__Hawke and Delpy, who co-wrote the screenplay with Linklater, have the sort of rapport that makes you believe they've loved each other for years. This makes it all the more painful when they start to drift apart.__One of the best films of 2013 and the irresistible climax to Richard Linklater's trilogy of on-the-run amour.__This one is a slowly evolving quarrel between two people who know each other inside out, delivered with the same intelligence and discernment but, as you might imagine, something of a cold shower.__Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both fine actors, but you'd be hard pressed to sit engrossed in a conversation between any actors that goes on for more than a couple of minutes. Usually. But not here.__Linklater and his actors expose small fissures with an admirable subtlety.__What Linklater, Delpy and Hawke have achieved with their trilogy is at once fluidly cinematic and novelistic, with stories behind the stories and possible endings beyond the endings we're given.__The Before series has steadily gotten better as it goes along, which is more than any but the most optimistic among us dare to hope for from love.__Before Midnight is the fullest and richest and saddest of the three movies in the trilogy.__the actual give-and-take between the characters is uncomfortably emotionally accurate, which means it will make an excellent, if challenging, date movie for both new and old couples.
When Dhoom 3 is going at full tilt, as in an autorickshaw chase over corrugated tin village rooftops, it's an exhilarating ride.__"Dhoom 2" had fun with the mechanics of crime and crime fighting. This movie can't be bothered.__Acharya's camera seems to be dancing - and swooning - along with the performers. Cynics need not apply.__Dhoom:3 is crowd-pleasing populist fare.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Machete Kills is a film in which style sardonically routs substance, a cloying gag built around the iconic quality of Trejo's matchlessly craggy face, which resembles a plate of sundried corned beef.__Machete Kills plays like a joke that's been told a few times too often.__When a celebrity chef like Rodriguez is just going through the motions, we can smell that the grindhouse fad is way past its expiration date. It's time to put a fork in it.__"Machete Kills" is barely a movie. It's an inside joke wrapped in a fanboy fantasy, pieced together through a haze of ironic detachment.__Endless assault weapons, exploding helicopters, crashing cars and floors splattered with blood, limbs and entrails, all adding up to nothing.__Machete kills, sure. Unfortunately, he overkills.__Machete Kills dulls more than anything.__Until your eyes glaze over after about a half-hour, "Machete Kills" might put a twisted smirk of guilty amusement on your face.__Uses a dull blade to hack away at the same targets that the first film so deftly eviscerated, namely B-movies.__"Machete Kills" is exploitation cinema, in the same way that a teen who pays $28 at the mall for a Sex Pistols T-shirt is a punk rocker.__Machete Kills is what happens when you stomp - or slash - a good idea to death.__It's saved by an enjoyably loopy script, several surprisingly strong performances, and the inventive direction of Robert Rodriguez, whose low-budget creativity is a performance in itself.__Where the first film reflected its simple roots by not reaching for too much, here it too often feels like Rodriguez is trying too hard to impress.__It's the kind of movie you pause to watch when it's on TV, but after half an hour, you'll click over to something else.__A conceptual throwback, to days when Roger Corman and other low-budget mavericks gleefully deemed any crazy idea worth tossing into a movie.__Robert Rodriguez is America's most frustrating filmmaker.__"Machete Kills"? "Machete Bores" is more like it.__"Machete Kills" is just plain bad in a way that is in no way good.__The strongest example yet of the corner [Rodriguez] seems to have painted himself into, a sad funhouse of bad movies made in thrall of bad movies.__Even a movie where Sofia Vergara wears a strap-on crotch gun is less crazy than our national conversation about immigration
There's nothing wrong with Paranoia that a stronger director, livelier leading actors and several hundred fewer narrative conveniences wouldn't cure.__This is a film at odds with itself, wanting to be a 99 percenter rallying cry but wallowing in and fetishizing 1 percenter accoutrement at every turn.__Paranoia, a ho-hum thriller about corporate spying in the high-tech world, comes off as a lot more preposterous than paranoid, and it takes no more than a few frames for the eye rolling to commence.__Corporate thrillers just aren't what they used to be.__In a movie about a new generation's hunger to topple the old guard, pretty boy Hemsworth is outclassed by his veteran costars, who get more mileage from baring their teeth than he does baring his chest.__The movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense and, when it does, it would be better off not doing so.__Fixates on the perils and panic of our modern surveillance culture while itself proving to be borderline unwatchable.__You watch it and, despite all the au courant techno geekery on display, you feel like you've stepped into a time capsule. It's a nice feeling at first. If only the movie were better.__You're not paranoid -- it really is bad.__"Paranoia" is too sloppy and slack to inspire tension.__Paranoia? More like deja vu.__While Paranoia has been cast with some top-notch actors, the problem here is a lack of oomph both in the script, adapted from Joseph Finder's novel, and the pretty lame direction by Robert Luketic.__Director Robert Luketic's thriller Paranoia has a host of problems, but the biggest seems to be that no one in it is nearly paranoid enough.__Slick but muddled thriller about corporate espionage never gets our pulse pounding.__There's much sprinting and keyboard-clacking for an audience that might feasibly value the sight of either over the presence of genuine invention or suspense.__The film is all thunderous cliches.__Why blaze new trails when the old ones are so well-marked? This one is essentially "The Firm" with smartphones.__"Paranoia" is a plug-and-play Hollywood thriller, not the best the genre has to offer but hardly the worst.__Screenwriters Jason Dean Hall and Barry Levy swipe plot twists from the film adaptations of best-selling author John Grisham's novels.__It's tension free and as a result, forgettable.
Even if you think of fish as the species served with chips, this is a delicious treat.__You won't be treated to any rousing choruses of "Some Enchanted Evening" in Journey to the South Pacific, but this equally exotic Imax entry proves enchanting in its own right.__Splendid views of marine life and the dulcet tones of narrator Cate Blanchett help a message of mild ecological alarm go down easily.__Images of dynamited fish and rising sea levels blend with a strong sense of native commitment to keeping the oceans clean.__I'm always delighted by the clarity and monumental proportions of IMAX films; this one lived up to my expectations.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
All of Black Nativity proceeds with sort of clumsy obviousness.__By the time the credits rolled, my eyes were sore from all the rolling.__Even the movie's most wretched characters glow in the Harlem lamplight.__Takes Hughes' nativity story and shoves it into the far background of a sincere but tritely told modern drama about family, faith, and redemption.__Its pastoral ambitions compensate for its lack of finesse.__By the time the film reaches its biblically inspired dreamscape of a climax, "Black Nativity" qualifies as equal parts surreal and stirring.__Kasi Lemmons' contemporary adaptation is an uplifting holiday extravaganza with a musical score filled with familiar spiritual standards plus some new songs by Raphael Saadiq and Laura Karpman that underscore themes of faith, healing and family.__Almost every beat of Langston's tale, with its absent father figures and heated gun-pointing melodrama, rings false-hardly a fitting contemporary complement to the Greatest Story Ever Told.__The corny, greeting-card feel of the second half weakens what begins as a creatively rendered take on a holiday film.__Hudson soars (duh) on the vocal numbers, and Whitaker (double duh) is a tower of integrity and crushingly human. But "Black Nativity" isn't about stars, it's about unity, faith and family. As such it shines.__Black Nativity offers a whopping serving of Yuletide emotion. And it's a musical - with plenty of wailing and rapping on the side.__It's good to see Hudson in a major film again. As an actress, she's still a work in progress, but she has a commanding gift for depicting vulnerability and strength almost simultaneously.__I'm glad to see [Lemmons] working, but this tired product won't do anything for her reputation.__Black Nativity is a cut-rate musical melodrama that grafts overreaching references to black culture onto a facile family-values narrative.__The melding of a modern family saga with the Nativity is too awkward and hectic to let audiences sit back and appreciate some powerhouse singers and music.__"Black Nativity" struggles mightily.__"Black Nativity" deepens into a rich experience once the scene shifts to the inside of a church, but it's a long time getting there.__Powered by an infusion of gospel and hip-hop that cleverly bridges gaps between generations and values.__A family-friendly, Hallmark Channel-ready musical dramatic fable whose plot more closely resembles Spike Lee's "Red Hook Summer.''__It becomes increasingly clear that the entire movie probably should have been sung.
[A] nuanced and unsentimental coming-of-age film.__This adaptation of Tim Tharp's novel, directed with delicate restraint by James Ponsoldt, sneaks up on you. It makes you laugh, then it breaks your heart.__Teller and Woodley hum together, and the movie does their performances justice.__This coming-of-age movie should appeal to smart, sensitive young people who haven't been exposed to the better examples of the genre.__The film is engrossing all the way through, the sweetest, saddest, most humane movie I've seen all year.__So many films featuring teens seem overstimulated or familiar. This one strikes a deep, rich note and holds it.__By the end of The Spectacular Now, you're not quite ready to let these characters go.__James Ponsoldt's "The Spectacular Now" hits on something few movies do: an honest, believable depiction of teenagers, in love and out.__A cleareyed, disarmingly tender teenage romance that bears comparison with the best of its genre, both old ("Say Anything") and new ("The Perks of Being a Wallflower").__The Spectacular Now captures the exhilaration and confusion, longing and dread of young romance with raw honesty and insight. Nothing rings false, nothing feels "cute."__It's rare hybrid: a movie that can find an audience among both adults and teens.__In The Spectacular Now, the high school seniors look and talk like actual high school seniors.__The Spectacular Now is zesty, funny, sad, and wise beyond its characters' years.__The movie captures the raw excitement and heartbreak of adolescence so completely that it manages to replace a seen-it-all jaded heart with the butterflies that accompany fresh experiences.__It feels real, its emotions earned. It shies away from the Big Dramatic Moment for the most part, instead doling out little victories and small defeats, which is similar to the way most of us experienced our teen years.__Fairly close to great, a lovely movie about young people that is in no way a formula picture. Original, truthful and moving: It's not about the phenomenon of being young, but about the particular characters, who are as specific and vivid as actual people.__Woodley is genuinely wonderful in it. And Teller's right behind her.__James Ponsoldt, who directed from a script by Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter, is a bit too glib to do justice to this material, but the young actors, especially Woodley, are quite fine.__The two leads, Miles Teller's Sutter Keely and Shailene Woodley's Aimee Finicky are so well drawn and believably portrayed that it's impossible not to accept them as real.__Here is a lovely film about two high school seniors who look, speak and feel like real 18-year-old middle-American human beings. Do you have any idea how rare that is?
The movie's problems are, in part, those of a great artist trying something new. It's a fine mess.__The Grandmaster blends right in with Wong's body of work, a gorgeous meditation on the importance of sorrow and lament. This one just happens to have kung fu, too.__It ranks with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers as one of the most elegant and beautiful martial-arts films to play American screens.__You leave this deeply flawed, deeply beautiful film with no doubt that you've seen an indisputable cinematic grandmaster in action.__Wong Kar Wai is an expressionist master. A master of character - deep, rich, truthful character - especially in The Grandmaster, he is not.__"The Grandmaster" can feel stiff at times, and something is doubtlessly lost in translation. But the precision and magic of Wong Kar Wai's camera is so captivating it doesn't matter.__Beautiful but troubled, achieving in stretches the director's signature dreamy mood but dragged down by narrative confusions.__Granted, "The Grandmaster" is not a primer on Chinese philosophy. Yet it may score as crossover cinema for Wong fans and Lee fans.__As a kung fu film, "The Grandmaster," with its exhilarating fighting sequences, won't disappoint. As a Wong Kar-wai film, it rates high.__Writer-director Wong Kar-wai has made a martial-arts movie that is truly a work of art. His "The Grandmaster" is a picture of staggering beauty.__The director took great efforts to be true to Chinese martial arts, but he did so without sacrificing his own distinctive vision.__The fights that dot this erratically told story of kung fu grandmaster Ip Man can leave you giddy with excitement.__"The Grandmaster" is the work of a director whose work throughout his career has been visually exhilarating, sensuous, even sublime. To that end, "The Grandmaster" doesn't disappoint.__The movie ultimately winds up falling between two stools, failing as both a biography and an action film.__A deliriously beautiful martial-arts saga, a mix of exuberant violence and restrained eroticism.__Whereas many kung-fu movies are a feast that leaves us weary with sensations, the tastefully bittersweet "Grandmaster" puts us in the mood for more.__The action choreography (by the great Yuen Woo-ping) feels oddly rhythmless; likewise, Wong's depictions of the larger-than-life characters achieve little emotional resonance.__Still, a butchered Wong Kar-Wai movie is better than most filmmakers' purest work, so even if the plot occasionally zips by at too quick a clip, The Grandmaster is a lush, albeit rushed, meal that's worth consuming on the big screen.__I've never been a big fan of Wong's phantasmagoric prettiness, but at least here it provides a welcome corrective to the usual martial-arts mayhem.__Ip Man's story has been told many times before by other filmmakers. Wong builds upon it, establishing the noble fighter as a reflective but still ferocious grandmaster in 1936 in Foshan, Ip Man's home city in southern China.
Even Redford bailing water for 106 minutes can be a bit much.__This is an uncommonly absorbing movie.__We get the predictable plot points - storms, sharks, close calls with passing ships - but it feels like a uniquely handmade artifact.__All is Lost is a testament to a great actor, an experimental piece of cinema and a bit of a bore.__All Is Lost is very much Redford's triumph. His turn isn't pure disappearance so much as a brilliantly human example of cresting and plummeting, cresting and plummeting.__The movie is rigorous, serious and well-crafted, with Redford holding the screen using only his economical emotional reactions and physical presence.__For all its formal austerity, All Is Lost also offers itself as a widescreen multiplex attraction, keeping all eyes glued on Our Man's dilemma, and every mind wondering if he'll manage to cheat death.__Eventually, even the effort to survive becomes questionable. We are all isolated, we all succumb at some point. "All Is Lost" studies that point.__Redford could win first Best Actor Oscar of his great career.__All is Lost is about how human nature rebels against death, even when all hope is vanquished by adverse circumstances.__Chandor and Redford make every moment matter in this fascinating film (despite an ending that will divide audiences).__Robert Redford's true grit and some wizardly images, not the script, are what make this one-man survival epic ineluctably compelling.__One actor. One setting. No back story. No dialogue. One hell of a movie.__Even at the age of 77, Redford can command a screen, and he's the main reason to watch this man-against-nature story.__Redford brings the watchfulness that has served him so well to every moment of "All Is Lost," infusing what is already a perfectly entertaining adventure with rich veins of symbolism and meta-meaning.__Although you may never be bored with "All Is Lost," you are rarely fully engaged.__Redford isn't precisely stretching his range as an actor here or revealing a new side to us. Rather, he's finding the cleanest, clearest way to express a quiet man's wiles and resources.__This is gripping as an adventure story even if doesn't achieve the profundity to which it aspires.__A nearly perfect thing: Economic, elegant, and elemental, it's a cleanly observed tale of one man trying, choice by choice, to keep the odds going in his favor.__In lesser hands, his character's ordeal might have been portrayed with big punctuation marks and dramatic flourishes. Redford's reactions are honest, in tune with a man of the sea.
It's smart and droll.__The sense of detachment that is a signature of Sofia Coppola's work -- the coolly distant, stylishly dreamlike way she regards her characters -- works to her detriment in  The Bling Ring.__This is a funny, sarky, bang-on portrayal of the freakiness of celeb obsession. The story would sound outrageous - if it wasn't true.__Emma Watson is comedic gold.__All the characters are shallow and one-dimensional and, while one can argue that this is the point, it doesn't make for 90 minutes of engaging cinema.__Daring to face these often noxious, seemingly empty phenomena on aesthetic terms, and taking on a degree of their flatness and simplicity, Coppola renders them surprisingly substantial.__Coppola neither makes a case for her characters nor places them inside of some kind of moral or critical framework; they simply pass through the frame, listing off name brands and staring at their phones.__s Coppola offering a critique (a stated hope) or somehow being complicit? These questions seem to coil in on themselves, making The Bling Ring that weird yet common hybrid of tsk-tsking and celebration.__It starts out as an expert docu-comedy about coddled teens who burgle celebrity homes and ends up an irritating, shallow mood piece about irritating, shallow people.__It has nothing to say about kids who had nothing better to do than to thieve from the rich and famous.__This is consumerism run riot without a moral compass, not the redistribution of wealth, but its pure celebration.__A modern-day cautionary tale about youth run amok that, for all its ripped-from-the-headlines topicality, still exudes a dreamy, otherworldly perfume.__It's fun while it lasts, but ultimately forgettable, kind of like the people they stole from.__Is this anthropology, or simply entropy? It's partly the former and lots of the latter, with precious little insight.__Ultimately, though the pace is snappy, the film feels a little empty; these teens seem too soulless even for satire.__A comedy, of sorts, if what it says about our obsession with the famous and the frivolous weren't so totally depressing.__What does Coppola want us to think about these beautiful young idiots? What does she think? She's too cool or too wary or too close to her subject to engage.__If you feel outraged and a little sick watching the people in The Bling Ring, it's because Coppola wants you to feel that way. You're not reacting against the movie, but with it.__Why did Coppola make this movie?__A frustrating shrug of ambivalence.
The movie boasts an understated sweetness, largely fueled by Camil's movie-star charms. He's the kind of performer who doesn't have to work hard to win over an audience; he is instantly likable. In a movie like this, that's money in the bank.__This entertaining crossover vehicle for Mexican star Jaime Camil sets a familiar love story to a mariachi beat.__Serving mostly as a strong calling card for star Jaime Camil, the film has an appealingly loose, slightly ramshackle charm.__This bilingual romantic comedy is overly long and has a paper-thin plot, but it's too sweet-natured to dislike.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Ropey performances, join-the-dots plotting and nail-shreddingly awful dialogue.__There are enough genuine moments of surprise to make this genre exercise an invigorating one.__Sharp ensemble work ups this thriller's intelligence quotient.__The lawyers are supposed to be former lovers, but the film doesn't allow the leads to display any chemistry; likewise, it doesn't generate any suspense from its tried-and-true conspiracy premise.__The movie is low-key but each scene is packed with information. Full understanding demands full attention.__It's storytelling informed by sloppy, absolutist thinking, and it lends one more uncritical voice to the many who seem unable to distinguish between kinds and degrees of evil ...__The somber tone conflicts with the far-fetched story line, sapping it of the energy it needs to effectively sell its twists and turns.__It's a film that eschews intrigue and insinuation for government agents who monologue about the dangers of free speech and fair trials while garroting their victims.__This officious, aggravatingly overexplained drama gets more washed out and dull as it goes along.__It has a chillingly matter-of-fact cynicism that is very au courant.__Rife with convenient coincidences, predictable plot contrivances and breathtakingly perfunctory revelations.__Directed unfussily and well by John Crowley, "Closed Circuit" has enough on the ball in terms of atmosphere and crafty performances to take your mind off the gaps in logic.__"Closed Circuit" is steeped in the details of English law, and rather than being obscure or arcane, these details ground the film and give it an authentic air.__Closed Circuit will engage you from the explosive opening frames. It may also leave a deep impression about the limits of personal freedom in a society where electronic eyes are everywhere.__Not only an intelligent, well-told and deftly acted story, it provides refreshing counter-programming in a season filled with noisy, uninspired sequels and mindless action movies.__A crisply enjoyable, professionally executed paranoid thriller of the "everyone is out to get us" variety.__A credulity-straining thriller featuring a few good paranoid moments - and, perhaps most important, Rebecca Hall running in high heels.__Closed Circuit may be little more than a high-minded, shrewdly topical gloss on a shopworn genre, but its cynicism is bracing.__Director John Crowley trots his crew around London, working up a suitable amount of suspense. And paranoia.__Mostly, this movie is a series of well-acted implausible events, tied together by a lot of scenes of people running.
Khan's gift for effortlessly moving between comedy and love scenes is complemented by Padukone's striking beauty and comic chops.__Shetty's need to maintain his characters' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness.__The movie chugs along for most of its 2 hours and 20 minutes searching for comedy and characters in a frantically overplotted story.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This is the most depressing movie ever made about radicalism.__You can't help but applaud the effort, even as it falls short.__Redford the director keeps things moving smoothly, avoiding too many lengthy monologues while still getting the point across ...__A drama that's more than a look at what happened to a generation of socially aware hippies whose new drug of choice is likely Lipitor.__Redford is an adequate director, and he keeps things moving at a moderate pace, passing up exits to more spectacular vistas or hotter issues.__What gets revealed should rattle, but it doesn't.__You wish the movie were a little snappier, but Redford doesn't do snap; slow down with it, and enjoy the chase.__Directed in steady fashion by Redford, The Company You Keep manages to keep its multiple strands of plot - and the people caught in them - from collapsing in a jumble of confusion.__The film offers a lot to chew on for boomers -- and for aging punks and indie-rockers -- who may still be wondering whether they made a separate peace with The System or simply gave up the fight.__"The Company You Keep" is packaged as a political drama, but at heart it's a preachy nostalgia tour of Vietnam-era liberal doctrine.__The high celebrity quotient tends to work against the drama, reminding us what a privileged generation this was and how its endless examination of itself in popular culture was part of that privilege.__This film, with its prickly characters and complicated plot, rips along with continuous tension and power.__"It winds up being less than the sum of its parts."__At its core, "The Company You Keep" is a good, solid thriller about a fugitive trying to clear his name. But it's a much more interesting movie at the edges.__The navel-gazing grows obnoxious, especially as the people on screen seem more like archetypes than characters.__Redford is interested in telling stories again, rather than pounding us on the head for our civic and historical sins.__It's best enjoyed as an actors' showcase.__Nearly every scene had me asking questions about what just transpired when I should have been absorbing what was happening next.__Sarandon's showpiece sequence, in which Sharon, grilled by the reporter while in FBI custody, stands up for her actions, is easily the film's best.__Drawing skillfully on a first-rate cast, Redford builds a riveting, resonant political thriller that values the complexity of its characters and the intelligence of its audience.
It's that versatility that defines these singers, the ability to make following seem as important as leading.__The documentary tells similarly poignant stories in a fast-paced 91 minutes through interviews, contemporary concert footage and great archival stuff.__As long as you're hearing the singing and stories of Lisa Fischer, Merry Clayton, and the great Darlene Love, you can bliss out on their passion.__The movie takes its cues from Standing in the Shadows of Motown, another act of pop-culture revisionism that tried to give musical credit where it was due.__Just about everything in this movie is right. And anybody who gives a rip about unsung heroines of popular music and giving credit when credit's overdue had better come up with a good excuse not to see it.__You may never hear the Rolling Stones's Gimme Shelter the same way again after hearing Jagger's and Clayton's separate accounts of the recording of the song.__The enthusiasm and love of music on display is just unavoidable. "20 Feet" may not get the whole story, but it gets some good ones.__Music documentarian Morgan Neville uses a mix of live interviews and archival footage to let the singers, and their music, tell their stories of vocal triumph and thwarted ambition.__You know all those doo-doo-doos and whoa-whoas-whoas you hear in pop hits? Without them, supplied by the likes of Darlene Love and Merry Clayton, you likely wouldn't be singing along to the songs you hear on your car radio.__This spirited, thoughtful look at unheralded but ubiquitous artists gives supreme credit where credit is due.__This illuminating documentary looks into a small corner of the music industry to find deeper truths about talent, artistry and success.__Loaded with stirring anecdotes and even richer music, Twenty Feet also makes for a fascinating study in ego sublimation.__An engaging look at the nexus of art and commerce, talent and hard work. It's a story of standing out and blending in, sometimes at the same time.__A film that may be the happiest time you'll have at the movies all summer.__This film festival favorite is a genuine crowd pleaser, meant to right a few wrongs in the music industry, offer a window into the lives of some hard-charging entertainers, and above all make audiences leave the theater humming a song.__20 Feet from Stardom has it all -- electric, revelatory stories, engaging personalities, and a gusto that takes you higher and higher.__I have rarely seen a movie that better expressed the revivifying nature of music.__In a film that's often sad but not without its triumphs, director Morgan Neville smartly explores the complex role that ego and self-promotion play in this profession.__When any one of these women steps up to the microphone - well, they really soar. And they carry us along with them.__Their voices are powerful enough to tear you apart and put you back together again, and their stories will do the same.
Much Ado About Nothing is a delightfully spirited romp, filled with visual splendor, strong performances and flashes of post-modern absurdity.__The movie swings along, with a grace denied to some of Whedon's grander projects ...__The magic holds. It holds from beginning to end.__This fast and loose independent production is enjoyable as a home movie, but not much more.__A delightful mix of the modern and the Elizabethan, a sort of do-it-yourself re-imagination of a true comic classic.__There's no fire, and where their lines should ricochet with wit, they just spill forth, affably.__Whedon finds unexpected meaning in this famously saucy "skirmish of wit," the opposites-attract story upon which myriad modern-day rom-coms have sprung.__No matter what movie or television show he is making, Whedon is a master of wit, of clever wordplay that doesn't just entertain but crackles with knowing energy.__Though Whedon's trimmed the play down, to make it an appropriate movie length, he's kept the dialogue intact, and the pleasure the cast gets in saying the lines is palpable.__Much Ado About Nothing couldn't look more different than Branagh's traditional version, and yet its big-hearted spirit is equal to the task of celebrating a classic while highlighting the reasons to remake it.__Won't please every fan of the Bard (or "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), but ... could inspire a debate as lively as the play itself.__It's like watching a gang of talented people put on a show in a friend's back yard. Which it is, actually.__Finally! A romantic comedy that works.__Joss Whedon's take on Shakespeare's classic tale is swanky, sexy and sophisticated, as bracing as a dry martini poured from a silver shaker on a summer night.__The most interesting aspect of Much Ado about Nothing is that it illustrates Whedon's ability to make a movie that relies exclusively on performances and dialogue.__Whedon's Ado is a parlour version of the play, shot in black and white, with documentary intimacy.__Rarely has wisdom been more joyous than in this supple contemporary version of William Shakespeare's seminal comedy.__Everyone acquits him or herself charmingly, and with a deep appreciation for why Shakespeare travels well, and in defiance of those who would dismiss him as dusty. The fact is, he's writing about us. It's as simple as that, and Whedon well knows it.__I enjoyed Whedon's film both as a species of stunt and also as a legitimately entertaining entry in the voluminous Shakespeare adaptation sweepstakes.__It's a slight but smart, sweet but guiltless celebration. Kind of like what making it must have been for a director exhausted from months of wrangling a herd of superheroes.
One of the happiest sights you'll see all summer is a montage of Gerwig running and twirling across Chinatown with David Bowie's "Modern Love" on the soundtrack.__As Frances literally dances her way through the streets of New York, you can't help smiling and knowing she will be OK. She will figure out how to be the adult she was meant to be.__Few films top Woody Allen's Manhattan for capturing New York City's blend of rapture and apprehension. Noah Baumbach's Frances Ha comes close.__Writing with Gerwig, Baumbach has created a fey, sneakily charming generational touchstone on a par with Annie Hall and his own Gen Y col-grad comedy Kicking and Screaming.__In your twenties you decide on the final version of you. Sophie is working on it; Frances is stuck in her crazy, clueless, can't-pay-the-rent stage.__It's a tribute to Gerwig's performance, somehow both clumsy and elegant, that she wins us over despite ourselves, that we come to appreciate her aimlessness in a goal-oriented society ...__This is an odd film (creepier than it knows), and even if you feel the atmospheric company of Dunham-ism, with a little of Whit Stillman, Henry Jaglom, and Woody Allen, the core influence on Noah Baumbach's film is fifty years older or more.__Baumbach usually builds his films around difficult protagonists, but Frances is entirely endearing, at once silly and deep, hopeless and promising.__The dialogue and editing are zippy and generally charming, combining with the tart observations of 20-something culture to create a nice frisson.__A black-and-white salute to the French New Wave (the score is borrowed from Georges Delerue, composer of many a Truffaut and Godard film) that manages to be very much of this moment ...__The movie's a love letter to an actress and her character, but by the end you may feel like an intervention is more in order.__The obvious love of New York City echoes Woody Allen at his best. But "Frances Ha" is very much its own film, a story of life and love and messy rooms.__Baumbach ... makes the film a celebration of Gerwig's coltish, goofball appeal.__But there's just something so relentlessly likable about put-upon, impoverished Frances (Greta Gerwig) that it almost doesn't matter that her New York is just one big Williamsburg.__Late-blooming 20-somethings have never been so perfectly captured -- and Gerwig has never been more appealing -- than in this funny, tender, life-affirming movie.__A modern fairy tale about a girl whose golden heart refuses to tarnish.__Like Gerwig's performance, it's natural, it's realistic, perfectly believable.__The conversations sparkle with both intended and unintended wit, and in a certain cockeyed light, Frances' blithe denial of reality is a charming affirmation of life.__The film may be small, but it's really good.__Has the earnest, wonky charm of a homemade valentine.
Even as someone who finds Metallica's music silly (ditto the movie's incoherent apocalyptic fantasy sequences), I was floored by much of the visual imagination.__It's all very appropriately overblown, and director Antal gives the fireworks as much attention as he does each performer.__Metallica, those thrash virtuosos of doom, get the grand 3-D opera they deserve: a godless-apocalypse-meets-Vegas spectacle, full of fireballs and electric chairs.__Metallica is as fierce and intense as ever, and the greatest hits set the band performs is a barrage of heavy riff-age that captures the band at its most vital.__In the real world, concerts build to a climax, then return for two or three more; on the screen, alas, "Metallica: Through the Never" just kind of peters out.__It's all very handsomely arranged, but even with the concert footage, nothing ever feels live.__Despite swooping camera movements and elaborate stagecraft, the film produces detachment rather than immediacy.__The problem is that Antal and Metallica took two different movies - a fine live-band document and a supernatural end-of-days romp - and smashed them together to make both of them more boring.__An old-school music video stretched to feature length.__Through the Never succeeds as a concert film by serving up enough dazzling visual wizardry and good ol' thrash metal rock to make it a passably engaging experience.__If half an hour of bizarro side-narrative fever dream is the price of admission for a gorgeously lensed, best-seat-in-the-house hour of chugging rock brutality, I'll pay gladly.__Lets viewers feel like they're sliding up and down the fretboard of Kirk Hammett's guitar, volleying between the cymbals of Lars Ulrich and swallowing spit spewed by singer James Hetfield.__This movie is basically "Spinal Tap" minus the jokes.__The 3-D concert footage is unassailably cool. Less assured is the occasional storyline threaded through the film.__If you're looking for an orgasmic trip to heavy-metal heaven, this is it.__Through The Never plays like The Black Album of concert films: It's enormous, slick, and occasionally rousing, but largely fails to capture the sheer intensity of Metallica's superior '80s work.__The 13-year-old me would have loved it, and I wouldn't be lying if I said that at times the movie turned me back into that 13-year-old kid.__A sweeping, ambitious take on concert films, "Metallica: Through The Never" works well enough visually, and certainly musically, to make up for its feeble attempt to fictionalize the lengths to which a fan would go for his favorite band.__It's a damn fine concert movie and a musical thrill ride. Period.__Arguably, the band has never been as tight as it is with lurking bassist Robert Trujillo; director Nimrod Antal knows exactly where to place his roving camera to sop up every double-pedal drum flurry and wailing solo.
It's all done with care and authentic Japanese locations ... But there's scant drama.__A stodgy movie that mixes dubious history with a cliched, Madame Butterfly romance story, set in the period immediately following Japan's surrender in 1945.__Emperor falls prey to the temptations endemic to historical docudrama: the desire to pack a miniseries' worth of events into one feature-length film, with romance tossed in for added appeal.__Half crinoline romance, half crusty military-history lesson.__Offers a labored treatise on the Japanese national character, with endless speeches about honor, devotion, loyalty, and the people's reverence for their emperor as a human deity.__Just a dull procedural, with the bland Matthew Fox driving around in a jeep and asking questions and not having them answered.__The epigrams fly, but the movie never really takes off.__Director Webber and the screenwriters, David Klass and Vera Blasi ... largely [waste] Jones and some very nice period details.__The subject is intrinsically compelling, yet the central story is padded with an uninvolving love story that functions mostly as obvious symbolism about compassion for the enemy.__Wrapping a history lesson in a romantic melodrama can make for a lively movie, but only if the love story is juicier than the educational narrative.__Regrettably, "Emperor" does not match MacArthur's vigor, or mine his legacy. Instead, the movie is Fellers' tale and dryly told.__In the end, probably the best way to watch "Emperor" is to pretend that the Supreme Command of Allied Forces in Japan after World War II was Tommy Lee Jones.__Despite the promising setup, the filmmakers' execution muddles what's inherently dramatic material.__Mr. Jones's performance is the only spark within this otherwise dull, well-mannered exercise.__The effort to put a personal face on the major issue of occupation is as timely as Iraq and Afghanistan, but the execution is clumsy and cliche-ridden.__"Emperor" starts slowly and peters out from there.__This potentially interesting dilemma becomes thoroughly dull in the hands of director Peter Webber, who stages endless conversations about political fine points without giving us much to look at.__[Fox is] so deadly serious, you long for a little fun. And that's what Jones supplies.__A methodical but dull fact-based drama set just after World War II.__When it stops preaching, the film is on surer footing, even if for a drama in which peace hangs in the balance, the stakes never seem very high.
Thematic inconsistencies abound as Stevens aims for a tone somewhere between Grumpy Old Men, The Hangover, and Goodfellas.__Some actors don't need top-shelf material. Just the pleasure of their company is enough. And so Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin turn the insubstantial Stand Up Guys into solid entertainment.__It's just fun to watch Pacino, Walken and Arkin work together, very much enjoying the shared experience. Seeing Stand Up Guys is an offer you could easily refuse, but hey, why fight it?__If you don't think Al Pacino still has it in him, this is a welcome chance to be proved wrong.__Is it fun? Sure, some of the time. Is it good? That's a stretch. Does it tap the potential of these three actors? Fuggedaboutit.__The degree to which "Stand Up Guys" succeeds at all is completely dependent on Walken, who elevates everything around him by seemingly doing nothing at all.__Fisher Stevens directed from Noah Haidle's script, which is obviously the work of a young writer.__It's been a long time since a movie wasted as much talent as Stand Up Guys, a film that aims to be a geezer Goodfellas but whose execution is a misfire.__Makes its way under your skin thanks to its three lead actors, all of whom have a way of bringing a uniquely weirdly spin to their not-so-tough-guy lines.__I can't argue that performers the stature of Pacino, Walken and Arkin don't deserve better material, yet it's so nice to have them onscreen together I'm in no mood to quibble.__Actor-turned-director Fisher Stevens gravely misjudges the tone - when he isn't trying to get too cute about everything, he slathers his characters in unearned sentimentality.__"Stand Up Guys" is mostly a string of low-key, almost-amusing chats over breakfast tables and pool tables, as if just watching these actors exhale should be entertaining enough.__Elegiac and corny and not really convincing on any level ...__It's like watching your grandfather get naked on YouTube.__In the end Stevens, probably wisely, just gets out of the way and lets the old guys have a ball.__An excruciating and melodramatic comedy.__For a worthier project, we'd gladly contribute to these legends' retirement funds, but a shaky scam like "Stand Up Guys" isn't even worth the price of an early bird special.__There is a sense that everyone, this treasure trove of talent included, is waiting for something to happen, some bit of alchemy that will make the story coalesce into a whole and take it beyond the jokes about Viagra, hookers and regrets.__Arkin in particular can barely hide his lack of enthusiasm for the material. Some of the looks he shoots his co-stars appear to contain a secret code of some kind, deciphered as: 'Well, at least I'm in 'Argo.'"__Stand Up Guys is the sitcom Mikey & Nicky no one asked for.
As nervy and as excitable as the trade that it depicts.__The material covered in the production's 128 minutes is not only inherently non-cinematic but not remotely "thrilling," at least in the conventional sense.__The Fifth Estate is also as current as a news feed, filling in the disputed facts about Assange's life beyond the headlines and chronicling the revolution that has upended the media landscape in the last decade.__Director Bill Condon delivers an intelligent, dynamic, character-centered drama.__Condon and his screenwriter Josh Singer don't quite know what to make of this duo, perhaps because the men didn't quite know what to make of each other, either.__"The Fifth Estate" feels unfortunately small and safe.__A feeble, reactionary drama.__"The Fifth Estate" tries to be a cross between "The Social Network" and "Zero Dark Thirty." Only it's more like "The Sociopath Network" meets "Zero Dumb Thirty."__It may be a bit chilly, but "The Fifth Estate" is good, scary information well-processed.__The problem with director Bill Condon's fictionalized account of all this is that, like WikiLeaks itself, there's way too much data to sift through.__It's not Wiki; it's just weak.__The Fifth Estate takes on the important 21st century question of information flow vs. privacy rights and fumbles it into a middling mishmash of techno thriller and future-of-journalism lecture.__The first narrative film portrait of the white-blond cyber bad boy feels undercooked and overwrought, haphazardly written and overdirected.__Benedict Cumberbatch restores mystery to the personality of WikiLeaks' founder, Julian Assange, and fascination to his role as a global crusader for free speech.__As much it claims urgency with current events and issues, it seems out of date, even coming just three years after the real events.__The movie can't quite decide what it thinks of [Assange] - or even if it should decide at all.__The movie feels both too soon and too late; an often skillful assemblage of bits and pieces, telling a story we already know and, ultimately, letting it fade away without an ending.__A fairly dull thriller about a hugely influential Internet phenomenon.__It's an intellectual grappling match that leaves viewers feeling worked over, disoriented and not much the wiser.__Exhausting in a new way, the movie is a data dump devoid of drama.
The strongest scenes take place in dingy hotel rooms, on a deserted farm or in the rehab sessions. It's during these moments that "Home Run" swings for the fences, and often connects.__It's preaching the gospel of a 12-step recovery program with a heavy helping of Jesus for guidance. And the corn can get pretty high ...__Almost from the beginning the message overwhelms the medium.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The Great Beauty is an utterly ravishing portrait of listless luxuriance, a fantasy of decadent wealth and beauty that evokes Fellini's La Dolce Vita by way of Baz Luhrmann.__Celebrating Rome in all its decay, this florid comedy by Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo, This Must Be the Place) opens with a hyperbolically gaudy party honoring a celebrity journalist on his 65th birthday.__A riotous film that finds depth, clarity and refreshment in even the shallowest of pools.__Throughout the film, Sorrentino delivers gorgeous images, crazy images, startling and sexy and serene images; it's a visual bath of sorts - the great beauty is everywhere, Jep (and we) just have to be open to it.__Though there's precious little drama, Sorrentino's skills as an image-maker are indisputable.__It's a beauty, all right. It's more a style show than a deep philosophical treatise, but with surfaces this sleek and faces this interesting, I'll take style over substance any day.__Go ahead. Soak up the Beauty. It's one of the best films of the year.__Sometimes all you want from a movie is more. Sorrentino's opulent carnival of modern Rome is the most more you could ever hope to see.__"The Great Beauty" resembles a contemporary "La Dolce Vita," Fellini's surreal 1960 tribute to Rome's splendor, self-indulgence and superficiality.__Paolo Sorrentino's overwrought, Felliniesque opus ...__At times it seems that every frame is a tribute to the Fellini classics of the early 1960s.__"The Great Beauty" is drop-dead gorgeous, a film that is luxuriously, seductively, stunningly cinematic.__If the antics of the beau monde disgust or exhaust you, stay away from Sorrentino's film; look no further, on the other hand, if you wish to know whether, where, and in what guise the spirit of Fellini remains at work-and, better still, at play.__This is a Fellini project, if you like, but it is a film full of music, dance, Rome's creme brulee light and a sensual tenderness, so that it might have been made by Renoir.__The melancholy in this film is just as trumped up as the frenzy.__The Great Beauty is a subtly daring cinematic high-wire act - an entire film built around one character's unrealized, unspecified yearning. And it might just be the most unforgettable film of the year.__Sorrentino's juxtaposition of contemporary Roman indulgence and the Eternal City's place in history's imagination makes for a bittersweet epic in which a solitary character, Jep, stands in for the director, and us, and experiences an epiphany.__Never have cynicism and disillusion seemed more intoxicating than in "The Great Beauty," which is such an overwhelming visual and auditory experience that its elements of cautionary moral fable threaten to get lost amid the gorgeousness.__There's an exhilarating sadness to it all that amounts to cinematic poetry.__[Sorrentino] stuffs, nearly engorges, this 2 hour-and-20-minute film with outrageous and gloriously visual anecdotes.
A routine music business cautionary tale, the film shuffles its decks ever so slightly by casting a Latino actress as its lead, but doesn't do enough to shed the exasperating confines of the star-is-born genre.__More heartfelt, humanistic, and entertaining than such a cliched showbiz cautionary tale has any right to be.__Almost despite our will, the cast keeps us invested in Filly's furious resurrection.__Unfortunately, the film is marred by a story, situations and stereotypical characters that strike all-too-familiar chords.__A trite piece of storytelling, with character development and plot points that feel not so much lived in as borrowed from other movies.__Gina Rodriguez's magnetic star turn keeps this often overwrought film engaging, even when the script lets her down.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

This charming Australian import has a groove much like other low-key, let's-put-on-a-show indies such as Hear My Song and The Commitments, and never uses its social conscience as simply backbeat.__The harmonies they strike in this reality-inspired charmer are sweetly sublime.__You could drive an Abrams tank through the film's plot holes, but you'll likely be too busy enjoying yourself to bother.__"The Sapphires" feels like a movie you've already seen, but it's nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable, like a pop song that's no less infectious when you know every word.__"The Sapphires" sparkles with sass and Motown soul.__Sapphires is hardly a cinematic diamond mine. But this Commitments-style mashup of music and melodrama manages to entertain without demanding too much of its audience.__It's pure joy.__It's a sweet little tale, and that co-writer Tony Briggs is the son of one of the real-life singers adds to the heart-tugging. In the end, though, it's not quite enough to sustain a feature-length film.__The Sapphires shouldn't gleam as brightly as it does. The up-from-struggle story follows the predictable form of movies like these, from Dreamgirls to The Commitments. But there's such a sense of joy ... that it's hard not to be won over.__Draining most of the blood, sweat and tears from a true story, this music-minded movie capably covers a song we've heard a hundred times before.__Let's trivialize a legacy of cruelty and denigration, in a country where indigenous people suffered from centuries of human rights abuse! And let's make the carnage of Vietnam look like a paintball game!__Delirious surprises crowd out the cliches in this thoroughly disarming movie.__[A] genial, entertaining, cliche-ridden showbiz story from Australia.__"The Sapphires" illustrates how the same old story - in this case, the one about a 1960s girl group and its struggles - can be freshened up through the novelties of place and characterization.__A very conventional story of a '60s Australian girl group gains extra power from its context and setting in this fact-based story set to the beat of Motown soul.__The performers improve it, or save it, depending on your viewpoint.__"The Sapphires" is a bit like a puppy you're trying to house break. It may have its bad cinematic moments but it's just so darn appealing that you have to love it.__Why resist?__While the fish-out-of-water story remains a little overused, the sweet soul music still provides a terrific hook.__For the most part Aussie director Wayne Blair's feature debut is snappy and fresh.
There is a powerful moment in [the film] when Diskin, head of the Shin Bet from 2005 to 2011, candidly remarks that for the Palestinians he is himself a terrorist. That is not relativism but realism, and the welcome sign of an empathetic imagination.__The film and its talking head participants paint the picture in both broad strokes and fine detail.__Whatever one's political stripe regarding Israel, it's hard to dispute the impressions and perspective of the film's six eyewitnesses.__The level of candor here may not satisfy hard-liners of either stripe, but it can help viewers begin to formulate new questions about the philosophical, strategic and moral challenges of conflict, in particular "wars on terror."__Ultimately the movie feels evasive, and its flashy, digitally animated re-creations of military surveillance footage unpleasantly evoke the Call of Duty video games.__It offers startlingly honest insight into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from some of those who called the shots.__As a political testament, the result is revealing and important.__A monolith crumbles in The Gatekeepers, and it's a sight to inspire awe.__As a clear-eyed examination of a conflict that seems to have no end, The Gatekeepers is powerful, provocative stuff.__A remarkable character study.__"The Gatekeepers" is a triumph of storytelling, a revealing view into the intricate shadow worlds of international espionage.__Moreh conducts a kind of primer in the organization's history, which is, in its own way, a history of modern Israel. It's fascinating.__If for no other reason, it deserves to be seen for arranging decades of events in the Middle East into a chronology that, to an outsider, makes dreadful sense.__A sobering but welcome dose of honesty regarding issues and events that have otherwise been shrouded in secrecy and overheated rhetoric.__Israelis, generally speaking, tend to be tough, but the men who've commanded Shin Bet, Israel's secret service, are in a whole other category.__A lesser filmmaker might've been tripped up by such a narrow focus. A lesser filmmaker might've misjudged the melange of archival footage, fabricated surveillance footage and talking heads, which Moreh handles with a blend of cinematic flash and tact.__The film makes explicit and implicit endorsements. The strategy of vengeance and overkill is ineffective and leads Israel to horrific behavior described only through metaphor.__The subjects' openness is refreshing - and sometimes frightening.__A feat - of access and of passionate and appropriately unsettling political commentary.__The Gatekeepers cuts deeper than any political thriller. It's a powerhouse.
Even having God on the production team can't save this 'Church Girl' from its heavy-handed sermonizing.__This overlong drama plays like a threefold infomercial: for Christianity, the cheesy resort chain Sandals and Jeff "Ja Rule" Atkins, the rapper-turned-actor playing drug kingpin Miles Montego.__A message film with the narrative sophistication of a recruiting pamphlet.__Suffers from the same ills as too many movies that preach to the choir: a laborious length, formulaic plot and dialogue and, disappointing for a film that stars a rapper, a stock score.__We're apparently supposed to root for these two to make it, although Vanessa is outlandishly jealous and pushy.__There is no reason a film with an agenda can't also be engaging or thought-provoking. But what we have here is not so much a movie as a blunt Sunday sermon.__Despite appealing performances and glossy production values, this faith-based drama has the feel of a lengthy church sermon.__In narrative and aesthetic terms, there's something unholy about its mixture of inane cliches, shallow music-video glossiness, and incessant preaching.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Gripping and suspenseful even though the ending is already known.__The best movie ever made about Chilean plebiscites, No thoroughly deserves its Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.__"No" is a picture that perches precariously on the cusp of a paradox.__"No" is filmmaking of the first order.__A cunning and richly enjoyable combination of high-stakes drama and media satire from Chilean director Pablo Larrain.__A mesmerizing, realistic and often hilarious look at the politics of power and the power of ideas ...__A political drama, a personal drama, a sharp-eyed study of how the media manipulate us from all sides, No reels and ricochets with emotional force.__It's a funny look at the way the media warp public opinion, and a curiously hopeful one.__On every level, "No" leaves one with bittersweet feelings about democracy, love and the cost of compromise.__If you can shake off the inherent grossness of mining the Pinochet years for yet another Mad Man-style deification of zeitgeist-grasping salesmen, this is moderately interesting stuff.__If there are fewer white-knuckle showdowns than in a Hollywood movie, the trade-off is a cool, ironic intelligence that ripples off the screen and up the years to where we live.__"No" stands proudly in a select sub-category of historical fiction films that work, completely and satisfyingly, as their own movies.__Garcia Bernal quietly carries this film as a soft-spoken kid in blue jeans and untucked shirt.__"No" isn't nearly as definitive or declarative as its title: It leaves viewers wondering whether they should cheer, shrug or shake their heads.__There will have to be a hell of a lot of good movies released in 2013 for No not to make my list of the year's 10 best.__It always retains a level of interest, especially for those of us who don't remember - or aren't old enough to remember - which side won.__Nominated by the Academy as the year's best foreign-language film, No grabs you hard, no mercy, and keeps you riveted.__Larrain's unarguable point is that, in politics, if we wait for good to issue only from the pure in heart, we will be waiting a very long time.__[Lorrain has] made a few daring choices here, not all of which work.__A troubling, exhilarating and ingeniously realized film that's part stirring political drama and part devilish media satire ...
Trance is high-order, film noir nonsense that takes Boyle back to the thrillers he made at the start of his career with John Hodge (he wrote Trance, too), like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, that were preoccupied with the grimy corners of the psyche.__Trance is to Danny Boyle more or less as Side Effects was to Steven Soderbergh: an arty spin on a trashy B-movie, engineered to showcase the director's particular gifts.__The story draws us in even through the murk.__Dawson walks through this film with majestic confidence while McAvoy is constantly inches from a full breakdown. And Boyle keeps that tension mesmerizing.__I came away wondering whether the headache I left the theater with was such a bad -- or even unintentional -- thing after all.__The plot of Trance is purposely convoluted - you're supposed to get more and more confused as the story unfolds, not always sure if what you're watching is a dream.__[Boyle] leaves it to the audience to try to figure out just what's up, and what's going down, in this sleek psychological puzzler.__It's an ingeniously built automaton, sexy as hell, and devoid of a heart.__If you're going to champion style over substance, you'll want Danny Boyle providing the style.__With "Trance," story becomes just another element in Boyle's commercial pop-Cubism, and the results are nearly fatal.__For much of the film ... Boyle's innate flair as a dramatist and conjurer keeps one clamped to the armrests.__Boyle is telling us a story of a perfect crime gone awry. But like his protagonist, he's really shifty about it.__Danny Boyle seems to have had a blast making Trance. It's a pity he makes it so difficult to share in his joy.__When we awaken from this "Trance," we wish we could have our amnesia back.__For a while, "Trance" had me guessing, and more or less hooked. Then the violence, motivations, double-crosses and fantasy/reality tangles became tedious.__The only perceptible purpose of the story is to pay homage to Dawson, and rightly so; her character is a rare blend of she-devil and sculptured deity, rising above the follies of mere men.__Boyle loads his movie with so many snazzy effects that we lose sight of what it all means.__I can't remember the last time I had this much fun having the rug pulled out from under me.__Danny Boyle's trippy, Inception-like thriller is a hypnotic head trip that demands you trust no one.__The dreamy unconscious in Trance seems haphazard, frenetic and often meaningless.
Marling and Batmanglij don't fear or resent entertainment: They make effective thrillers... If they reach a major studio and bigger budget, they could be the right kind of dangerous.__Its morally ambiguous investigation of extreme left-wing politics is ... light years away from usual multiplex concerns.__The latest collaboration between director Zal Batmanglij and screenwriter Brit Marling suffers from the same problem as their previous picture, Sound of My Voice: It's taut, compelling, unpredictable and completely wipes out in the final few minutes.__"The East" leaves questions unanswered, but at least it asks those questions.__A fast-rising newcomer to film, the willowy Marling is maturing fast, and encouragingly unwilling to dumb herself down for stock girlfriend roles. This is her strongest work yet and I hope a harbinger of much more to come.__Marling and Batmanglij bring an evenhanded perspective to their portrayals of the characters and issues involved.__A watchably confused eco-thriller that's never sure who its heroes are.__It is a smart, well-acted drama, and another chance for Marling to exercise her unique talents, creating intriguing characters on the page and the screen.__"The East" prizes an initial air of mystery over consistent drama, and as a result ends up squandering its intriguing premise.__As is often the case with people who become major stars, [Marling] seems as if she has always been there. She's new and yet familiar, as if we've known her all along.__As a scriptwriter, actress Brit Marling has so far demonstrated an unerring instinct for creating meaty, if somewhat hard-to-swallow, roles for herself.__Another project that proves this actress and filmmaker has the chops that will guarantee her longevity in the movie industry.__The East is not a very good movie, hobbled by an excess of plot, a lack of believability and big gaps of logic.__When the filmmakers try to flesh out the terrorists, they fall back on the conservative cliche that they're spoiled rich kids, mad at their parents.__A taut espionage drama that pits global corporations against a radical band of ecoterrorists.__Marling has a focus and poise that keeps us invested in her character's journey - even when the film begins to falter, as The East eventually does through inconsistency and expedience.__It's irritatingly smug.__The reason the movie works, despite some "movie-stupid" developments in the second half, has everything to do with the low-key and unaffected quality Marling brings to the screen.__Marling and Batmangli are smart enough to know that character and ideas matter, and how the presence of those things can improve action and suspense.__In most respects a conventional genre picture. But it's passionate (and weird) enough to evolve into something mysterious and moving.
With its warm colors and sweet streams of light, its love of both the countryside and the human form, it makes you dream of painting. Or making movies. Or just luxuriating in the brilliance.__Thanks to ace Taiwanese cameraman Mark Ping Bing Lee, it conveys the inspirational qualities of sun-dappled light and rosy flesh.__"Renoir" doesn't get much beneath the surface - but, good God, what a surface.__For those who just want to float away on waves of beauty, "Renoir" is a boating party.__Stately to a fault, the film is not enough drama, too much still life.__One would expect a film about French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir to look beautiful, to be shot in warm, sumptuous colors. And one would not be disappointed in Gilles Bourdos' "Renoir."__If you love the paintings of Auguste Renoir or the films of his son Jean, there's a good chance you'll sit through this slow-moving prestige item.__Gilles Bourdos's film is more conventional than its mould-breaking subjects deserve.__As sensually beautiful as the work of its subject matter, French filmmaker Gilles Bourdos's dreamy biography Renoir is more a series of tableaux than a narrative film.__The director Gilles Bourdos's sunshiny Portrait of the Artist as an Old Man.__Sumptuous, savvy study of art making, love and light. Much of the passion, however, is in the pictures.__The sequences of Renoir and his chambermaids luxuriating in the sun-soaked countryside summon up not only Renoir's paintings but also such great Jean Renoir films as A Day in the Country."__Like the paintings of the master, "Renoir" is beautiful to look at, but it would be a mistake to call the film (or its subject) shallow.__The performances are assured, the ambiance impeccable and the themes resonant.__Theret - who is supposed to be playing the muse to two great artists - never seems much more than young and pretty, and Rottiers only young and uncertain. When the film switches to them, it goes still.__A lush, involving film that deals not with one Renoir but two, as well as the strong-minded woman who was a key player in both their lives.__"Renoir" is so beautiful, and so intelligently conceived, that you keep waiting, in vain, for a bit of fire to break out in the narrative.__The movie, like its subject, refuses to stir up unnecessary melodrama.__Breathtakingly lush, lingering on subtle textures.__[An] atmospheric, well-acted period piece.
Melds the intriguing with the hokey in a variation on the standard template of a nonbeliever who changes his outlook amid a holiday miracle.__Relates the weak-tea parable of a town that receives a wish-giving candle every 25 years from an angel.__This holiday movie about a man of God who regains his faith thanks to a miraculous candle is as picturesque as a snow globe and just about as full of human life.__This odd Dickens-meets-Sunday-school movie is as artless as the setup is muddled.__"The Christmas Candle," based on a book by Texas minister Max Lucado, might be the ideal movie for Christians in search of family-friendly entertainment, but its appeal won't stretch beyond that demographic.__"The Christmas Candle" seems destined to be a Hallmark movie of the week. But in spite of the hammy histrionics requisite for the genre, it is not at all a turkey.__The whole thing is sentimental corn, which isn't bad if it's handled with conviction and sincerity. But the direction by John Stephenson (better known for special effects than directing) is resolutely stiff and hollow.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Blue is the Warmest Colour is too exceptional a film to be defined by its controversy.__An astounding, complex film about the ecstasy, the danger and the beauty of love.__One of the year's best films.__A love story so erotically charged that it short circuits our higher functions.__Forget the controversy and see Blue is the Warmest Color for what it truly is: a warm and compassionate ode to the vagaries of the heart.__This exploration of tumultuous romance is rare in its scope and frankness.__The more wondrous things about "Blue Is the Warmest Color" include its emotional honesty, precision, abandon and need.__This three-hour portrait of a young French woman named Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos) captures the dizzying, all-consuming ardor of first love, the joyous discovery of bringing your body and mind into union with another human being.__Make no mistake, "Blue Is the Warmest Color" constitutes a breakthrough, in addition to being the best film of 2013.__A great movie.__The film's French title is "The Life of Adele, Chapters 1 and 2." At the fade-out, you feel, with sympathy and hope, how much more lies ahead of her.__So full of passions and appetites, it's impossible for it not to exhaust you. Yet, isn't too much of a good thing better than not enough of it?__About our appetites-for love, connection, life fully and vibrantly lived-and how, at the end of the day, we still end up hungry.__It's an almost overpowering experience - a movie that transcends voyeurism and invites empathy.__What makes this melancholy relationship drama play out as more than a hot lesbian remake of Annie Hall is the vibrant connection between the two gifted actresses at its center.__The two actresses, seen up close or from far away, are extraordinary. The emotional trajectory of their passion is entirely believable and ultimately heartbreaking.__Love hurts in Blue Is the Warmest Color. That's why it sticks with you.__An undeniably moving picture which is both problematic and astonishingly acted, sometimes frustratingly wrongheaded and occasionally lit by flashes of insight.__A routine love story elevated by one of the year's most magnetic performances.__The film is like a tough exam that everybody aced. The director, the actresses, the moviegoer - we all deserve a tres bien.
Everything is wrong with [Spike] Lee's version of Park Chan-wook's notorious, super-violent super-action-thriller. For one thing, it's far from super. Not the quality, per se (although, for Lee, that's off, too), but the energy.__Why would we want to watch a chronicle of Joe's agonies, and the agonies he gets to inflict on others? Passing it up would be the best revenge.__Hollywood's wildest cinematic freakout since "Shutter Island" is a remake of-and an improvement on-the Korean original, from 2003.__A vivid yet academic remake, this Oldboy is shorter, leaner and lesser.__Sometimes I don't understand the Hollywood mindset. Who thought remaking Park Chan-wook's 2003 cult classic, Oldboy, was a good idea?__Much of the dialogue is stilted (several scene are laughable) and the melodrama feels unmoored without the lurid, baroque atmosphere of Park's film -- which, after all, was kind of the whole point.__Viewers who are coming to it cold will, most likely, leave feeling enervated, confused, and queasy.__What's onscreen feels squeezed, truncated and curiously embalmed. It's got no kick to it... Oldboy just lies there like old news that's not worth a second thought.__Lee's is more of a hard-edged, hammer-and-nail noir than Park's existential horror, and it's far less concerned with the internal state of Joe's mind than the external havoc it creates.__Just as depraved and depressing as the original.__The violence ... is gruesome - oodles of CG blood and brain matter - but out of scale. It's shock for shock's sake. It doesn't track.__[An] enormously unlikely but still satisfying paean to payback.__Spike Lee's Oldboy "reinterpretation" hoists the hammer and baseball bat with vigour, but fails to make its own mark.__Brings to mind Samuel Johnson's famous 18th-century witticism, likening a woman preaching to a dog walking on its hind legs: "It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all."__Lee is very good at creating a sense of free-floating dread, but he, and his screenwriter Mark Protosevich, don't have a real flair for pulp (or, as with David Lynch, the hallucinatory horrors of pulp).__Try as he might, Lee cannot repurpose this empty genre tale to be deeper than it is.__Lending real gravity to his character's single-minded crusade, [Brolin is] the best reason to give the film a chance.__Spike Lee turns Josh Brolin into a full-bodied antihero in this all-American remake of a Korean cult movie, but the story remains a bloody bag of tricks.__Weaknesses from the original remain, including a mustache-twirling villain straight out of a Bond film (Sharlto Copley) and a Freudian master plan that unravels the more you think about it.__Relentlessly gruesome, self-consciously shocking and pretty much pointless.
The acting throughout falls into two registers; pantomime mugging for most of the cast, while the romantic leads, Russell and Feild, look so ill at ease that you pity them.__Austenland is modest fun but needs to show it has a brain under its sun bonnet.__"Austenland" understands Austen's enduring romantic appeal but has no use for her deeper themes of class, wealth and gender inequality.__It's tentative in its intentions and afraid to push all the way with its premise. It is not sharp enough as a comedy, and when it tries to shift gears and become a romance, it is unconvincing in its machinations.__A mildly surprising and completely heartwarming ending casts a glow over the previous 96 minutes of "Austenland" but can't wipe out all regrets for what might have been.__Everything rings false, and the spectacle of bad actors pretending to be bad actors may trouble your sleep for some time.__Austenland begs a couple of questions: One is why, Keri Russell, why? The other: Where is Christopher Guest when you need him?__Hess has made a classic rookie mistake: Any spoof has to be at least as smart as the thing it's spoofing, and this one's twice as dumb.__A wan comedy aimed squarely at whoever it is who buys all those "Austen-inspired" books cluttering up the publishing world.__There's an inspired silliness to "Austenland," an erratic, entertaining comedy with an inspired premise.__There are a few flashes of wit in the romantic comedy Austenland, but for the most part, the humor lands not with Dear Jane's grace and style but with all the subtlety of a cholera outbreak.__It's a piquant idea, but the execution is intolerably clumsy.__No matter how bleak things seem, Austen's characters always manage to find a euphoric and contagious happiness. And that kind of feeling needs to be earned. It can't be replicated with a checklist of plot points.__The film does little delving into what could make a modern woman so hung up on the romantic conventions of yesteryear, even less with complications of class conflict.__It says weirdos deserve romance too, and that Austenland isn't so much a page in a book or a place on a map, but a corner of your heart.__The missed opportunities in "Austenland" are more numerous than dowry-less sourpusses at a ball in a Jane Austen novel.__Russell plays Jane's scatterbrained romanticism with such underhanded charm that she goes a long way toward making the laughs seem pertly knowing, even when they come at Jane's expense.__Unfortunately, this scattershot comedy only occasionally hits the mark.__A tribute to Miss Austen needs both sense and sensibility, sparkling wit and a variety of attractive suitors.__Austenland is so sluggish and plodding that I started imaging a cross-over with another fantasy-resort movie, wherein the Yul Brynner gunslinger robot from Westworld would show up and lay waste to all of these dullards.
A troubling expose of Sea World's hazardous entertainment trade.__Blackfish makes an especially strong case for the innate marvel of these animals: that they are smart, social, communicative and loving.__In the wild, orcas live between 50 and a hundred years. In captivity, it's half that. It's simply a strong argument to free all the Willies.__"Blackfish" is a disturbing movie, one that will make you rethink parks like SeaWorld and their value.__Blackfish is intended to rattle and provoke in the hopes of bringing about change.__"Blackfish" is grim. But then again, so is the plight of these magnificent, intelligent whales.__Informative, earnest, but less than briskly paced.__"Blackfish" makes a compelling case that the cruelty of life in captivity is the cause for a rash of fatal attacks by orcas on their trainers, aggressive behavior that no so-called killer whale ever has exhibited in the wild.__Its ultimate message is clear: Killer whales belong with their families in their natural habitat, not performing for audiences. After listening to this film's many impassioned voices, it's hard to argue.__It not only delivers astonishing, suspenseful footage that makes it a legitimate thriller, but also serves up thoughtful meditations about using wild animals for our own entertainment.__It's hard to imagine anyone coming out of this movie and not swearing off the next vacation trip to Orlando, San Antonio or San Diego.__Unfortunately, this feels like a ten-minute news segment blown up to theatrical proportions.__While Cowperthwaite's film opens with a simple question about the behavior of a single killer whale, it ends up mounting a persuasive ethical argument against keeping orcas in captivity.__"Blackfish" is no trumped up horror story fueled by Hollywood brand names and special effects. In this riveting documentary directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, all of the creatures are real, and all seem entitled to the serious chip on their shoulders.__The film may be depressing. But even with a terrible, watery musical score, it's also good.__This is one of those docs during which audiences gasp and cry out - or just cry - at regular intervals.__Blackfish, a documentary by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, puts the "killer" back into killer whales by indicting those sea parks that, in her well-chronicled estimation, place profit above safety.__Meet a theme-park phenom in the form of the killer whales (orcas in the trade) on view in Gabriela Cowperthwaite's gripping mindbender of a documentary.__Blackfish is enough to make anybody think twice about the wisdom of turning whales into performers.__[Its] argument never fails to be gripping, its structure perfectly executed to maximize its persuasiveness.
Even the always-watchable Shannon can't give much life to Kuklinski's two-dimensional presence: he's little more than a series of murders and pained looks.__Shannon gets at his character's pent-up torment as well as his efficient disconnect. When his two worlds start to converge -- on his daughter's sweet 16th birthday, no less -- you feel for him.__A true-crime thriller directed with grit, gristle and punchy energy by Ariel Vromen, The Iceman is never less than fascinating, even if things get a little ham-fisted here and there.__As the body count mounts, the movie begins to spin out of control, but Shannon and Vromen don't let it derail. Their focus keep things from melting down.__Michael Shannon is an overpowering actor, and in The Iceman, the best that he can do is wrestle the movie around him to a stalemate.__It's a fascinating subject - the beast that lurks inside the family man - but the movie blows it.__It's often mesmerizing, primarily for Shannon's performance as a man who's a master of compartmentalizing ...__It's as if one of the sideline characters from "Goodfellas" or "The Godfather" starred in his own spinoff.__As both violent drama and character study, Israeli director Ariel Vromen's film does everything it should.__This biopic sounds like a perfect vehicle for Shannon, who's come to specialize in playing psychopaths, but it doesn't give him much to work with.__Why would anyone want to watch something so determinedly downbeat, so unerringly serious? Because of the performances, Shannon's in particular.__The script ... offers few insights into Kuklinski's psychic makeup or motivations and even less reason to care about them.__While Hollywood keeps coughing up comedies and thrillers about sympathetic hitmen, the true story dramatized in "The Iceman" should bury those noxious fantasies forever.__Just when you think you've seen enough of these wiseguys, along comes a story like Kuklinski's, and an actor like Shannon.__The Iceman offers a chronological view into the life of its title protagonist... and what a life it is.__There's not much style here, beyond the uniformly good acting, and even less of a point.__"The Iceman's" problem rests instead with the script, which the director wrote with Morgan Land, his collaborator on the "Rx" screenplay. It never gets underneath Kuklinski's skin in a way that illuminates the psychosis.__Michael Shannon's mesmerizing portrayal of Richard Kuklinski, a notorious contract killer, has the paradoxical quality, peculiar to many great screen performances, of being unreadable and transparent.__Shannon inhabits this character so completely that by the end of this hard-to-watch, hard-to-look-away-from movie you feel you can, if not understand Richie, at least wish he had found some redemption in life.__Shannon is brilliantly unnerving as he callously dispenses with people, then returns home to maintain his facade of a loving husband and father.
This is an extraordinary first film, nerve-tingling in its intensity, and assembled with a finesse and control even the great Austrian director Michael Haneke might envy.__Beautiful and mysterious, the[se] first glimpses are an ideal primer for the Israeli film, which never rushes to spell out the meanings of its subtle and quiet moments.__It's an artful, character-driven drama that constitutes a minor miracle of empathy.__Burshtein creates a one-of-a-kind portrait that nonetheless transcends its setting, and even its worldview; the dynamics are global.__Burshtein has achieved a gripping film without victims or villains, an ambiguous tragedy drawing on universal themes of love and loss, self-sacrifice and self-preservation.__[Burshtein] vividly depicts a clannish culture that is likely to feel foreign and perhaps off-putting to generations that came of age in a progressive post-feminist era.__[Burshtein's] subject is a woman's right to choose her spouse, and what a weighty, giddy, confusing, clarifying and, ultimately, sacred choice that is.__There's a clotted and cramped feeling to "Fill the Void" that's downright creepy.__A sympathetic, layered portrayal, rich with detail, that earns its more complex and resonant conclusion.__A moody, exquisitely told tale of love and duty.__None of the religious rituals feels particularly spiritual, and even the nominally happy ending fails to alleviate the oppressive tone.__An elegant miniature, Rama Burshtein's "Fill the Void" labors under a narrative inevitability, but it's artful work nonetheless.__"Fill the Void," a compelling and skillfully made domestic drama, is a rarity, a film that's both set within, and emerges from, a devoutly religious world.__I left Fill the Void feeling privileged, however briefly, to have been brought into this world.__Burshtein's cinematic experience has more than honed her quietly effective and inherently dramatic filmmaking style, it's deepened her gift for emotional honesty, for knowing the truth of a situation and how to convey it to an audience.__Both accessible and thrilling.__A love poem to the ultra-Orthodox world as seen from within.__Practically an ethnographic film__Trouble is, while the social milieu is nicely realized, other parts of the drama are not. Too often Burshtein cuts off a scene prematurely, darting away just as the crucial moment of emotion or confrontation appears.__[Burshtein has] reinvigorated a familiar narrative by painting it against an unfamiliar backdrop.
The price of good intentions is that it looks and feels like an extended public-service announcement for goodness.__No one would confuse the movie with a short-story collection. But it's more ambitious and effective at blunting cynicism than most consciousness-raising efforts.__Illuminating and ultimately hopeful, despite the horrible circumstances depicted, "Girl Rising" stands as a testament to the power of information.__Director Richard Robbins delights in dotting his screen with bursts of color, from a shimmering orange dress to the deep purple of a pen cap, while the stories, shaped by anecdotal brevity, are often charmingly modest.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Screenwriters Ziad Doueiri and Joelle Touma pull quite a few punches here, making the doctor improbably naive about Israeli-Palestinian tensions so that his transformation seems profound.__"The Attack" doesn't force us to pick a side. But it does force us to question our outsiders' hope in conciliation.__Arouses profound questions about fanaticism, cultural identity, and the essential mystery of other people, even those we think we know best.__It's set up as a descent into the heart of darkness, but it ends up playing out in pallid shades of grey.__Imagine a blissful life taken away: Story of an Arab man who's assimilated into Israeli society but finds out that his wife was a suicide bomber. Nothing new here about the conflict, fair portrayal of the sides, thought provoking without solutions.__[Doueiri] does a fine job of presenting us with two worlds in conflict: modern, prosperous and progressive Tel Aviv, and Nablus, a city of shadows, squalor and paranoia.__"The Attack" is about madness, personal and political, and a tragic overlap of the two beyond understanding.__The Israeli-Arab conflict is stripped to its most intensely personal level in The Attack, a haunting and heartbreaking meditation on violence, choice, love and duty that is one of the most remarkable films of the year.__Delicately executed thriller balances its political baggage with unflagging suspense.__As this film demonstrates in so many ways, the intractability of the Arab-Israeli political situation is, to put it mildly, not easily resolved, least of all onscreen.__Though it's never less than involving, it grows in stature as it unfolds and ends as a more subtle and disturbing film about love, loss and tragedy than we might initially expect.__The Attack is an ineluctably involving study of a civilized man caught in the middle of a ruthless, bloody conflict.__Remarkably accomplished and self-confident.__The film unfolds like an endless argument, and in a way that's perfect; the unhappy union at the heart of "The Attack" isn't just the one that Amin and Siham had, but the forced one that that Jews and Palestinians continue to have.__"The Attack" starts out strong and swiftly unravels somewhere past the midpoint.__The Attack spreads the blame around for what is undeniably a nasty situation, any way you look at it.__[An] intelligent, involving movie that's by turns a murder mystery and a politically charged argument about contemporary Palestinian identity.__Suliman, who plays Amin, also starred in Paradise Now, and it's no stretch to say The Attack is the most urgent, unblinking movie about the Israeli-Palestinian divide since that 2005 stunner.__This doleful and nuanced Middle Eastern tragedy is unlike any other recent film from the region in various ways.__A gripping, personal examination of a seemingly unresolvable conflict.
It's too safe, too knotty, too wastefully handsome, too dull.__Stoker trembles between the portentous and the ridiculous, and I think you know which one is going to win. The audience does make its decision: They've been had yet again.__Stoker is a movie about tension and inaction, about people trying to figure out what's going on in someone else's head.__Stoker is a cunning exercise in transgression. But one can't help but wonder what kind of film Park might have made if he'd had the full creative control to which he's accustomed in Korea.__None of it is life-changing, but it is effectively eerie. Stylishly spooky, even.__"Stoker" plays out like a Kabuki "Macbeth": gallons of style slathered on a story you already know by heart.__"Stoker" is a thriller in which the big question is not "What will happen next?" but rather "What is going on?"__[It] seems to be unfolding somewhere else; somewhere where it makes sense that everyone seems to be sleepwalking.__Aesthetics are steering this ghostly ship, leaving narrative in the background to fend for itself. Fortunately, Park is in full command of his repertoire.__Even though Park creates and sustains a mood, and shows what an athlete he is with the camera, the actors are struggling valiantly to give some emotional texture to a story that, ultimately, defeats itself.__If the destination isn't what it might have been, the journey is a heck of a ride.__A beautifully twisted, slow-burning psychothriller that may or may not all be taking place inside India's head, Stoker marks South Korean cult director Chan-wook Park's inaugural English language venture.__Refracted through Park's graceful filmmaking style, "Stoker" is mysterious, demanding, sometimes baffling and richly rewarding.__Stoker is deliciously demented, and that's a good thing.__Like a taxidermied owl, "Stoker" is lovely to look at, but in the end it's hard to give a hoot.__Park employs all manner of cinematic derring-do -- shock cuts, off-kilter compositions, discontinuous storytelling -- all to no great purpose other than to make us go "Wow." A more appropriate response might be, "Huh?"__Thanks to Park's endless creativity behind the camera, it's impossible to look away from Stoker, even when what's happening on the screen is truly risible.__It's not pure Park or pure Hitchcock but a muted, mildly mesmerizing blend of the two. You might want to take a careful stroll in this Hitchpark.__Talent behind the camera, talent in front, and yet nothing worth watching. What happened?__Park isn't interested in simply trendy material and edgy effects; a former philosophy student, he wants to weave it all into a genuinely disturbing drama.
The crescendo of two resonant careers makes the false notes of "Unfinished Song" forgivable.__Shamelessly sentimental, cute to a fault, but the acting is first-rate.__The gentle story of a marriage, and of how music can help make a broken heart whole again.__Unfinished Song is full of predictably poignant moments; you'd be lucky to survive the film dry-eyed.__[A] modest, tear-jerking charmer ... Just don't expect too much more than what shows on its paint-by-numbers surface.__Vanessa Redgrave and Terence Stamp and those voices - their solos contain this picture like carved book-ends, vintage and lovely and still so profoundly of use.__Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave would be captivating reading the nutrition label on a bag of crisps, so it's no surprise that they elevate "Unfinished Song"...__It's worth a watch, if just for Stamp's complex performance. Just don't forget to bring some tissues.__[A] sappy drama.__Blends the premise of TV's Glee with liberal splashes of recent older-skewing audience pleasers Quartet and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in predictable fashion.__[Stamp] and Vanessa Redgrave, as well as supporting actors Christopher Eccleston and Gemma Arterton, raise "Unfinished Song," Paul Andrew Williams's entry in the golden age genre, from mawkish to genuinely heartwarming.__Get out your handkerchiefs for an unabashed tearjerker that has some surprisingly potent moments. Buried in all the shameless sentiment is a touching family story, and good performances from veterans Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave.__When it's over you may notice red marks on your throat, so determined is "Unfinished Song" to strangle the audience into emotional submission.__It's all very predictable - including the competition the group enters, the tragedies along the way, and the final big-hugs-all-around ending.__The director, Paul Andrew Williams, at least had the good sense to cast Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave as his leads. Who can possibly look away from those two whenever they're on screen?__Williams fills his screenplay with nails that he can then hammer for the rest of the running time, so whether it's dying wife/mum/grandma or strained father-son relations that bring you to tears, the movie keeps pummeling you until you produce them.__It may be hokum, but it gets to you.__The movie works mostly because of the artistry of its stellar cast and heartfelt script by writer-director Paul Andrew Williams.__[It] doesn't earn its sentimentalism; instead it rolls through a series of cliched life lessons that never come close to exploring the film's emotional territory with any depth or commitment.__Stamp could not be better as a man set emotionally adrift when he loses the love of his life.
The conflation of sports and politics in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag always feels strained, with Singh's story remaining most absorbing as a story of personal -- rather than national -- triumph.__Farhan Akhtar's intelligent performance is a highlight of the film.__There are triumphs, both in front of and behind the camera, but they often get overshadowed by a story that tries to do too much.__The way the movie strikes its chosen couple of notes resoundingly, making clear what makes Singh run.__Often an engrossing example of the sweeping, stirring biography.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Result: sufficient pleasure.__The middle-aged romance between the central characters is a lovely thing, and that makes up for everything.__Bier is daring to deal with both familial dysfunction and mature romance without painting either in the standard broad strokes.__We've seen enough romantic comedy to know these two are destined to fall for each other, but Bier is that rare filmmaker who can make you wonder if there will actually be a happy ending.__Pierce Brosnan isn't the only reason to see Love is All You Need. He's merely the best reason to seek out Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier's entertaining if familiar romantic comedy.__I lost count of how many times "That's Amore" turned up on the soundtrack, and the comic situations are so stale that the whole thing plays like a Scandinavian Tyler Perry movie.__Brosnan is good, and he and Dyrholm erase any and all signs of contrivance in the plot, the script.__This is a mature rom-com, if that's not a contradiction in terms.__Adult sophistication is Bier's aim, and she delivers.__Despite the excess cheese atop the story, the setting in the birthplace of pizza gives "Love Is All You Need" a satisfying finish.__Soft around the edges, but with sincerity at its heart.__Bier spices up the long-hackneyed generic formula with lush location cinematography, outstanding performances ... and subtitles, but otherwise the movie needs a lot more than love.__Bier's first English-language film deals in the same dumbed-down wish fulfillment peddled by standard American studio fare. What's the Danish word for "Sarah Jessica Parker"?__Dyrholm has an unusual magnetism, the kind of face that seems open and unguarded, yet you can't figure out just what it is she's thinking - she and Brosnan share an excitingly adult chemistry.__Even with its flaws and occasional flat-footed choices, this is still a rare movie for grownups.__Rather than give her protagonists vivid interior lives, Bier defines them in relation to the satellite characters who circle them ...__Despite the gorgeous sights and rollicking sounds of sunny Italy, a Scandinavian heaviness hangs over the film, with a screenplay by Ms. Bier's frequent collaborator Anders Thomas Jensen, based on a story they developed.__A lovely little lark with a good head on its shoulders.__It's the rare love story that avoids treacly sentimentality. Even rarer is a believable romantic comedy featuring middle-aged people that avoids jokes about sagging flesh and waning libidos.__Two troubled souls struggle with obstreperous relatives and a bundle of unresolved life issues apparently snatched from the nearest airport bookstore.
If a personal memoir film by a beautiful, successful young woman from a nice Toronto family sounds to you like it can only be an excuse for self-absorbed navel-gazing, well, you must not have seen a Sarah Polley movie yet.__Stories We Tell is one of those movies you watch on a screen and replay in your head for days, moving between its many levels of inquiry and touched, always, by Polley's compassion toward her relatives in particular and people in general.__he opposite of a courageous piece of work, Stories We Tell goes out of its way to protect every single person it touches.__Sarah Polley's remarkable Stories We Tell transcends every cliche in this confessional/investigatory genre, and it's one of the year's highlights.__Everyone has a different story. I found myself holding my breath listening to them talk. The story twists like a thriller.__Stories We Tell is not just very moving; it is an exploration of truth and fiction that will stay with you long after repeated viewings.__Part of the movie's pleasure is how comfortable the "storytellers" are with their director; you get a sense of a complicated but tight-knit family, going along with Sarah's project because they love her.__What a great movie.__Never sentimental, never cold and never completely sure of anything, Polley comes across as a woman caught in wonder.__After you see it, you'll be practically exploding with questions - and with awe.__Stories We Tell is just the latest reminder of nonfiction film's current, endlessly innovative state. That's a story worth savoring.__It's a relationship drama spanning three decades, a detective mystery, an essay on the nature of memory, and a critique of our need to process messy human life into streamlined narrative arcs even at the cost of oversimplifying.__As one watches it, certain questions may arise. But don't worry - the answers are fascinating.__Sarah might have wrapped up this documentary after her parentage is revealed about 70 minutes in, yet it continues for another 50 as she ruminates over the tale,... her engrossing personal story gradually devolving into an exercise in self-regard.__Stories told again and again have a way of neatening things up. Stories have a way of ironing out the wrinkles. Polley lets the wrinkles remain.__Sarah Polley's documentary is a startling mixture of private memoir, public inquiry, and conjuring trick.__Polley was right to follow her instincts, though, in not attempting to tie everything up. She recognizes that family histories are necessarily contradictory, crazymaking, and essentially unfathomable.__What unfolds is a riveting drama that grows even more so as it plays out.__Don't be fooled by its deceptively simple title or the hesitant, unassuming way it begins. Writer-director Sarah Polley's "Stories We Tell" ends up an invigorating powerhouse of a personal documentary, adventurous and absolutely fascinating.__A brilliant, thought-provoking documentary.
Disconnect turns out to have a complicated view of life in the digital age. Rising to scenes of real intimacy and insight, the movie is stimulating, and, at times, touching.__Handsomely shot and judiciously edited, the film benefits from a superlative cast ...__It's left to the actors to make up for the gaffes, and they're definitely up to the task.__Even in the heightened awareness of a post- age (and its ), Disconnect is naturally gripping.__Journalists lie, spouses stray and thieves steal, but "Disconnect" keeps trying, unsuccessfully, to pin the blame on technology rather than its users.__I preferred "Disconnect" 10 years ago when it was called "Crash."__As cautionary tales go, "Disconnect" is a pretty good one, but it's not really a whole lot more than that.__In the sobering drama Disconnect, technology is one of the culprits that separate people from each other - but not the only one.__"There wasn't a moment during this movie when I was thinking about anything other than this movie"__One of the rare films that directly responds to and expresses modern anxieties.__A deeply flawed motion picture containing moments of brilliance that illustrate its strong thematic content.__There's a movie to be made, perhaps, about the way that electronic devices have created distance between us. But it'd be better if not every story revolved around a crime.__Soulful though the film is, melodrama gradually sneaks in, and then it takes over.__Not as bad as 'Crash,' but it sure as heck ain't good__What works is the uncomfortable intimacy of peering over the shoulders of, say, Patton when she watches YouTube videos of her dead son, and the shudder of recognition that our hard drives are our external consciences.__A bleak vision of life in the Internet age as an asocial network where faceless predators abound, heedless kids live secret lives, everything is phishy until proven otherwise and quests for love or intimacy lead to loneliness or grief.__Rubin, the award-winning documentary filmmaker of Murderball, working with a script by Andrew Stern, is good with the details, and he gets strong performances from his cast in this, his debut feature.__Worst-case scenarios for our forays into chat rooms and social network sites are laid bare, as are the illegal and immoral contours of the digital landscape in this well-acted dramatic thriller.__The film ominously conveys a world of too much information but too little communication, where people have become slaves to glowing hand-held devices that were designed to make life easier but have made it busier and more complicated.__Built around several seemingly separate but ultimately interconnected stories, Disconnect will earn comparisons to Crash. Yet unlike Crash ... Disconnect tempers its more over-the-top moments with a real sense of tension and emotion.
Berman and Pulcini -- American Splendor, The Nanny Diaries -- found a tone somewhere between tragedy and nonsense.__There are moments to make you honestly wish it were a better movie, and that the semi-autobiographical screenplay by Michelle Morgan didn't feel so much like a first draft.__Once you get past Imogene's insufferableness, you'll find yourself rooting for her.__Kristen Wiig's comic artistry and its melodramatic tinge are squandered in this frenetic, schematic comedy, which also lays waste to a fertile premise.__Nobody in this movie is really appealing enough to be much fun. The state of New Jersey should sue.__"Girl Most Likely" is a strange movie, in that it has the atmosphere of a comedy and some extreme characters set up to be comical, but there are really no funny scenes.__Wiig didn't write the script for Girl Most Likely, but surely all those years of making tangy lemonade from the SNL writing staff's lemons must have given her the chops to do more than she manages to do here. What a shame.__This one seems a little determined in its quirkiness, assigning its characters one gag apiece.__Girl Most Likely is a case of good actors in serious need of worthwhile material.__Another movie about a woman falling into a deep funk because some narcissistic twit dumped her.__This film suffers, as you can guess from this precis, from quirky-overload.__Wiig finds herself sadly outmatched in this comedy crammed with wacky and tacky characters-types, all of them-in which she's stuck functioning as the uptight, frustrated straight woman in the middle.__Kristen Wiig delivers another adorkable star turn in 'Girl Most Likely,' which works until it doesn't.__It's funny and pleasant and comfy enough. But reach, Kristen, reach.__Unfortunately, it's just not funny enough ...__[Wiig] might want to consider whether she really wants to get stuck unto eternity playing women on the verge.__I only laughed once ...__Somewhere in this overstuffed mix, there's probably a good movie about a woman's journey to self-discovery and self-acceptance.__Flat and mostly unsurprising.__A failure from start to finish.
The most radical and cheering message of Wadjda is that a change isn't just possible, but inevitable.__"Wadjda" earns extra points just for being what it is. Who knew that, in a country that famously frowns on women driving cars, some are even allowed to make movies?__This delightful debut feature by a Saudi woman named Haifaa Al-Mansour uses a bicycle as a metaphor for freedom within a social circumference.__A sweet little film about the human spirit, about want and energy and determination against unfair odds.__In Saudi filmmaker Haifaa al-Mansour's winsome wonder Wadjda, a young girl's aspirations provide an intimate glimpse into the possibilities and limitations of a cloaked culture.__More than a critique of Saudi society, "Wadjda" offers a character with universal resonance and appeal.__Al-Mansour seems out to make a movie that works in America. Which is likely a savvy move, since it seems unlikely she's going to get much traction back home.__The film is deserving of its position as a pioneer. It's a heartfelt, touching peek into the day-to-day life of a culture Westerners rarely get to see.__Wadjda is a movie about freedom - and nothing represents freedom with the metaphoric simplicity and symmetry of a bicycle.__"Wadjda" is a terrific film.__Wadjda captures Saudi life on the cusp of serious change, but it's by no means a solemn drama. Al-Mansour writes and directs with a light touch and hopeful aspect.__An unqualified delight, a sharp, insightful comedy that subversively explores women's place in Islamic society.__There's a lot more going on in this first feature film from Saudi Arabia, where movie theaters are banned, than the deceptively simple story of a girl who's willing to do just about anything to buy her first bicycle.__A simple story told with economy, "Wadjda" is a notable example of old-school, humanistic filmmaking.__"Wadjda" works quietly and well in its story of a young protagonist questioning the restrictive status quo.__Though writer-director Haifaa Al-Mansour doesn't break new ground aesthetically, she relates the experience of a Saudi Arabian girl's coming of age clearly and unsentimentally, which alone makes this a must-see.__What keeps Wadjda from devolving into a sort of heavy-handed cultural show-and-tell is its title character.__This is not just the first feature by Haifaa Al Mansour but the first feature to be directed by a woman from Saudi Arabia. That is quite a burden, and yet by some miracle the movie bears it with lightness and grace.__It's a stunningly assured debut, a slyly subversive delight, and one of my favorite movies of the year so far.__What makes the movie so delightful is that Wadjda isn't trying to make trouble; she's just being herself.
"The Ultimate Life" is hampered by a predictable story, stereotypical characters and wooden acting.__A terminally dull piece of faith-based family-values filmmaking designed to appeal strictly to the converted.__The message of "The Ultimate Life" could be summed up on a greeting card.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Coming on like Stand by Me meets Son of Rambow, the boys' adventure is essentially dreamy indie-teen wish-fulfilment.__A warm and affectionate comedy about that last great summer when you're 13 or 14 and you don't realize just how much your life is about to change and things will never be the same.__This willfully eccentric tale about teenage boys in suburban Ohio fleeing their families to live in the deep woods plays like an erratic comic revue slapped together at theater camp.__There is much here to admire, but the overall impression is of a film that does not have the courage of its convictions.__Once they go into the woods, the movie becomes as interesting as watching kids hang around and play with sticks.__In its small, independent way, "The Kings of Summer" rules.__The Kings of Summer is the cinematic equivalent of an Arctic-cold popsicle on a Sahara-hot day. Refreshing and satisfying but not overly sentimental, the film taps into the frustrations of adolescence with warmth and wit.__Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and writer Chris Galletta bring a fresh and sympathetic eye to the story, evoking the pleasure of what feels - for a little while - like endless possibilities.__The foundation of a much better movie is buried somewhere beneath the debris that's too quickly piled on to The Kings of Summer ...__Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts cut his teeth on network cable series and Internet comedy shorts, and it shows. Instead of developing a genuine perspective he simply repeats the same few stylistic gestures ad infinitum.__Starts out as a raunchy teen comedy, slips into nature-epic mode, then adds a romantic triangle and finally finds a comfort zone in family-sitcom land.__The sharp wit, soft-focus cinematography and slow-motion lyricism lift it into the realm of this summer's nicest surprises.__Vogt-Roberts makes the scenery look great, but doesn't call the plays that could make the movie score. Scenes don't develop, characters don't evolve except in indie-movie-cute ways.__A stylish and very funny teenage coming-of-age story graced with surreal fringes and a mysteriously hushed core.__Sometimes, a movie just has a magic about it, something that makes you look past implausibility and plot holes and whatever other shortcomings it may have and leaves you feeling good just for having seen it.__An unconventional coming-of-age story that's likely to appeal to the rebellious teen in all of us.__One senses the filmmakers were going for something more profound and transformative than what ended up on screen.__For all its humor and fleeting moments of beauty, The Kings of Summer feels like a cluster of cheap narrative devices posing as a finished film.__[The Kings of Summer] has some vitality, but it sinks into cliche just the same.__"The Kings of Summer" invokes [John Hughes movies] without Xeroxing them, creating its own little oddball suburbia.
The sheer warmth and liveliness of Fiennes's Dickens means he's impossible not to like.__Fiennes and screenwriter Abi Morgan adapt Claire Tomalin's book with delicate grace, presenting love as blessing, curse and, perhaps, inevitable force.__Why did this bright, vivacious, intellectually engaged girl willingly lock herself up in a wealthy man's seraglio? Put bluntly, what did she get out of it? In the end, "The Invisible Woman" remains a mystery.__It's wonderfully cast ... and beautifully designed; a quiet pleasure.__An air of complacency hangs over the project; its condemnation of Victorian sexism makes us congratulate ourselves for our more enlightened views.__Even if you don't entirely buy this version of events, director Ralph Fiennes has given us a speculation that works as drama. It's an elegant bit of goods.__A literary love story that's rooted in repression.__Fiennes, who's getting awfully good at directing himself and everybody around him, envisions Dickens as something of a rock star in 19th century London, a popular, glad-handing figure who can't step out in public without an adoring audience swarming.__Fiennes reveals just what a fiercely energetic force Dickens was. With her fulsome mouth and hazel eyes, Jones offers a convincing mix of youth and precocious awareness.__Shot with a stillness that serves to reinforce the restlessness in its characters' souls, The Invisible Woman offers a fascinating view of a young woman whose eagerness and energy are slowly compromised ...__While the whole thing is Victorian to the flower-patterned mantlepieces and oil-lamp lighting, this is a living, breathing portrait of people caught by familiar emotions and imprisoning social codes.__[A] compassionate, clear-eyed, beautifully conceived portrait ...__Ralph Fiennes, working from a screenplay by Abi Morgan, has brought this story to the screen in a film that will appeal greatly to Dickens enthusiasts and those who enjoy British costume dramas.__Ralph Fiennes does a marvelous job as Dickens and as the director of this film.__In some scenes, Fiennes is too free with the handheld camera. But he does make the movie all-aquiver, rich in feeling.__In the scenes of Dickens acting on stage or delivering a public reading, Fiennes' bravura transcends itself; it becomes something magnificently real, a sort of divine extroversion.__"The Invisible Woman" is a strong movie about a young woman who makes a choice and then lives with it, accepting the reality of knowing all and yet having to stayinvisible.__As good as Fiennes is, Jones is even better.__Fiennes and the screenwriter, Abi Morgan, have mounted an accurate re-creation of Victorian England, but the affair isn't much of a story-at least, not as realized here.__The Invisible Woman at its best does justice to the complicatedness of its characters -- just as Dickens did as a writer.
Reich is a natural teacher of complex concepts: The film doesn't feel like homework.__Inequality for All is intelligent, persuasive and accessible, a gentle but urgent clarion call to action.__Overall, this film is enlightening, entertaining and seriously alarming.__This documentary would be a rousing David and Goliath story even if its hero weren't the diminutive Robert B. Reich.__President Clinton's secretary of labor lectures on income inequality with a refreshing lack of jargon.__Robert Reich, a secretary of labor under President Clinton, leads us through a sharp-eyed essay-meditation on the rising trend of income inequality.__Reich manages to infuse this enlightening/infuriating documentary on extreme income disparity in the United States, and the corollary marginalization of the middle class, with an optimistic spirit. One that may or may not be justified.__Any politician hoping to redistribute America's wealth should screen it before every stump speech.__It's unseemly, I know, to praise a movie like this for the stand-up-comic affability of its host. But Reich's engagingness also gives credence to the seriousness of his message.__Reich is no condescending intellectual. He has no contempt for people of the opposite point of view. He even has nice things to say about Bill O'Reilly.__Reich is funny, poignant, passionate.__A cinematic listicle of misleading economic talking points.__Mr. Reich ties together his talking points with a reasonable-sounding analysis and an unassuming warmth sometimes absent from documentaries charting America's economic woes.__The film is as much about Reich as income inequality, a topic he has written and talked about for decades. You'll learn why he's 4 feet 10.5 inches tall and why he became active in social politics.__If you're looking for a streamlined explanation for the mess the U.S. economy's in, and how we might get out, it's as good a place to start as any.__This lively film takes a "greatest-hits" approach to Reich, who fears that we're headed for another financial debacle if we don't take a more serious approach to taxes and education.__Smart, funny and articulate, Robert Reich is the university professor we all wish we'd had. He's so accessible and entertaining he takes a subject that sounds soporific and makes it come alive like you wouldn't believe in "Inequality for All."__Presents Reich's position by patching together lectures from his "Wealth & Poverty" course at the University of California, Berkeley.__Animated charts and graphs, on-the-road interludes and humorous asides designed to show that the speaker isn't too dislikably severe about the crisis that threatens Life As We Know It.__Mr. Kornbluth's documentary argues eloquently for such unassailable goals as investment in education and infrastructure, and complements Mr. Reich's exposition with compelling interviews ...
Polished and calculated, this is a nerve-shattering fright fest bolstered by immaculate technique.__It's a credit to Zombie's interest in growing as an artist that he's drawing from more mature inspirations here, but it's also part of why the movie doesn't work.__It's all meant to be monstrous, unspeakable, blasphemous horror but it comes across more like a slightly dirty drawing, passed in seventh-grade religion class.__Movies by Rob Zombie, the goth rocker turned cult filmmaker, aren't for everybody. But he couldn't care less.__Considerable care goes into establishing the premise, but the film eventually abandons psychological subtlety for hallucinatory garishness, which is too bad.__"The Lords of Salem" will make you feel bad. But it's supposed to.__Rob Zombie, film scholar? I'm convinced. Rob Zombie, filmmaker? Mmmyeah, not so much.__A more restrained kind of grungy horror throwback than the rocker-turned-filmmaker has offered to date, at least marking a step in a different direction, if not necessarily the right one.__Atmosphere is three-fourths of the game in a horror film, and "The Lords of Salem" has it in spades.__A portrait of vengeful occult torment that pushes hard to redefine the meaning of "witch trials."__Although it eventually descends into silliness, this creepily atmospheric effort delivers some effective scares along the way.__You get the idea that "The Lords of Salem" would be a lot scarier if you could tell what was going on.__Zombie proves once again that he understands how many different ways there are to give an audience the creeps.__Instead of retreating into his manic, hyper-allusive style of psychedelic, grindhouse-friendly pastiche, Zombie tested his considerable skills and made something different.__Some of this looks cool enough, but most of it's just silly satanic mumbo jumbo that's not particularly scary.__So bad it's hilarious.__Even as a coven assembles, the movie forgets to scare.__The movie is eerily photographed, but never suspenseful or scary, and eventually, events descend into goat-sacrificing silliness.__Less inferno than slow burn, Rob Zombie's retro witch thriller The Lords of Salem has plenty of portent but not much payoff.__None
"Romeo and Juliet" is too soapy and improbable to count among the Bard's very best plays, but it surely has some of his best dialogue, and messing it up this much is close to inexcusable.__There are reasons to see this Romeo and Juliet-it's just a shame that Romeo and Juliet are not chief among them.__The grown-ups outshine the kids in this handsome, romantically anemic rendering of Shakespeare's perennial.__What can you say about a Romeo and Juliet that lacks heat, romance, eroticism, or lyricism? Mercifully, not much.__Juliet should be a girl, but the story's trajectory of self-sacrifice requires her to become a woman. Steinfeld gets the girl part exactly right, but she botches the transformation.__Pretty on the outside but lacking something more than a menagerie of lush brunette heads.__If you really love this story, go see the Franco Zeffirelli version (or a good production of "West Side Story"). And if you truly love Shakespeare, read any of a dozen of his other plays instead.__Here's betting the new film version of Romeo and Juliet probably won't inspire a new generation's passion for Shakespeare.__This is the Teen Vogue version of the ultimate young love story.__[Director Carlo] Carlei's film is not particularly imaginative in terms of context, but it offers proof that this material never tarnishes, that with the right sort of movie magic, even a traditional telling can be thrilling.__A sufficiently entertaining, adamantly old-fashioned adaptation that follows the play's general outline without ever rising to the passionate intensity of its star-cross'd crazy kids.__If there is one novelty in director Carlo Carlei's take on the world's best-known ill-fated lovers, it's that the words aren't entirely Shakespeare's. It's a fresh approach, indeed, but maybe not the wisest.__Viewers who go into "Romeo and Juliet" cold may be forgiven for coming away thinking Shakespeare was a really lousy writer.__Douglas Booth is a handsome fellow, in a mushy-peas kind of way, but Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar-nominated for True Grit, neither looks appealing nor acts with any distinction here.__Shakespeare's play evokes the poetry of undying love, but this "Romeo and Juliet" is prosaic.__In a way, it's like the cover of a favorite pop tune - inferior, to be sure, but nevertheless pleasantly familiar.__Verona, we have a problem. And thy name is Juliet.__The lovers provide no palpable passion. And without that, there is very much woe. But not much point.__While there is a pleasantness about this faithful Shakespearean reboot, there also is some woeful miscasting and a lukewarm feeling about the straightforward production.__Seventh-grade English teachers, rejoice. You have a new movie to show the class that day you come in hung over and can't deal.
Growing old together can't be easy, but in this case, it's certainly beautiful.__Writer-director Michael McGowan covers all the bases here -- the long-standing romance between the aging couple, the hovering concerns of their son and daughter, the constant head-butting with the building inspector -- with well-paced confidence.__Writer-director Michael McGowan (Saint Ralph) shows affinity for the subtle undercurrents of a long, happy marriage, but the friction between Cromwell and the government bureaucracy stays one-note.__Bring a handkerchief, or possibly a bedsheet, to "Still Mine"; this fact-based, beautifully acted drama could wring tears from a brick.__[A] tough-minded tearjerker, based on a true story ...__It is about a husband and wife, partners through six decades, grappling with issues of aging, and how to spend what time together remains with grace and dignity.__While this slight Canadian film has limited appeal for general audiences, seniors and families affected by Alzheimer's will find much to identify with.__"Still Mine" is uplifting and heartbreaking, a contradiction that results in the viewer exalting and being let down at the same time.__The bond between Craig and Irene is beautifully illuminated by McGowan's script and by acting that feels rich and real.__Bujold amply conveys Irene's longing for Craig in deep-toned ways that one almost never sees in movies about people over the age of 70. Actually, you rarely see it in movies about people of any age anymore.__"Still Mine'' eschews schmaltz, and is tremendously moving.__More vital than a thousand movies populated by hot, squirming teenagers.__What would otherwise have been be a rather banal David-Goliath story ... is elevated by Cromwell into something more weighty, and even existentially profound.__"Still Mine" offers James Cromwell a rare shot at a leading role, and he makes the most of it.__If last year's searing old-age tragedy, "Amour" - or 2006's bravely blunt "Away From Her" - weren't digestible enough for you, perhaps this mild romance will suffice.__Still Mine is Mr. Cromwell's film from first scene to closing credits...he is always present, alive and real, with a wealth of understated feelings. This is the greatest performance of his rich career.__The mounting structure-and the subsequent stop-work orders-frames the couple's reflections about the approaching uncertainties of their twilight years, which they deliver with humor and affection.__The unforced intimacy between James Cromwell and Genevieve Bujold as a senior couple in the fact-based Still Mine is rare to see in characters of any age. For actors playing a husband in his late eighties and his wife of over sixty years, it's remarkable.__McGowan's film doesn't want to get its hands dirty, which winds up making its portrait of cruel twilight-years realities-and the enduring power of love to see one through those difficulties-as easily digestible as its lush rural panoramas are picturesque.__Offers a strong and dignified look at growing old while maintaining one's long-held convictions.
Sensitive and almost unwatchably perceptive about dysfunctional families -- and it's acted with knife-sharp precision.__The film is touching, filled with taste and care, but not enough to avoid being coy and sentimental.__On the surface, this indie does sound like standard-issue material, but its dynamics are far more complex than its simple exterior.__What Maisie Knew gives the audience a ground-eye view of its mesmerizing title character, a plucky, charismatic New Yorker who navigates downtown bars and building lobbies with the street savvy of a pro.__The result is a film that deeply engages us on multiple levels. Not only do we wonder what Maisie knows and how she knows it, we want to get this seedling to a place where she won't have to be transplanted every day.__It's a study of human nature, not at its worst, but at its most typically pathetic, and it goes to show that the more things don't change, the more they stay lousy.__Intimate, unnerving and entirely addictive.__The aggravatingly manipulative What Maisie Knew feels, perhaps deliberately, as if its emotions were drawn in brightly colored crayon.__As Maisie, Aprile seems lit from within; a more vividly natural child actress I have trouble imagining.__The story is sad, but the talent involved in its telling is elating.__"What Maisie Knew" packs a surprising emotional punch, one that stays with you for a while when the movie's over.__Mischievous updating of the Henry James novel, made especially moving by young Onata Aprile.__What Maisie Knew" is about the erosion of innocence in the midst of plenty, yet it rarely feels heavy-handed, so serene is its own faith in its tiny heroine's strength.__Selfishness and cruelty never go out of style, which might explain why this millennial update of Henry James's 1897 novel works so well.__The camera is often at Maisie's eye level, emphasizing how adults are seen by the perceptive Maisie. The sad-eyed Aprile's honest portrayal is heart-wrenching.__A raw, uncomfortable examination of a family torn apart by two parents who love their daughter only half as much as they love themselves.__Without losing the 19th century author's sensibility, screenwriters Carroll Cartwright and Nancy Doyne have brought into the modern age James' unforgiving examination of the effect of a messy divorce on a child.__The film raises more uncomfortable questions about Maisie's uncertain future than it ever answers, but that's in keeping with the emotional honesty the filmmakers are striving for.__We experience her upsets without the leavening of outside interferences. And because Aprile is such an intuitive performer, we are always searching her face for the imprint of her suffering.__Some moviegoers may opt for an easier cinematic pleasure than this carefully crafted, discomforting look at familial misery in hyper drive, but it is the most provocative movie about parenting I've seen since The Kids Are All Right.
Thanks for Sharing might best be described as being like Steve McQueen's sex-addiction drama, Shame, if it were rewritten by Neil Simon at his most schmaltzy.__It's frankly exhausting to keep up with these neurotic over-sharers, who are neither serious enough to care about nor humorous enough to laugh at.__At least most of the cast is appealing, with Mark Ruffalo, Gwyneth Paltrow, Josh Gad, and Alecia Moore (better known as pop singer Pink) delivering the uninspired dialogue with relative finesse.__Be warned: viewers may experience a violent urge to shake the characters, one by one, and tell them to get a life.__After the bleak brilliance of 'Shame,' this is an almost sunny look at sexual addiction. Almost.__Thanks for Sharing is never quite crazy or funny enough to transcend its "disease-of-month" template.__First-time director Blumberg does a fine job and makes some brave choices.__This feel-good look at a condition many refuse to acknowledge as a disease skips the self-pity and gets right to the heart of the issue: namely, the very real problems sex addicts have in creating interpersonal relationships.__Most of all, there's Ruffalo, who in his scenes with a very good Gwyneth Paltrow, plays a man who, with heartbreaking vulnerability, is straining to normalize himself. It's a major performance in a minor movie.__The arduous trail to recovery from sex addiction gets cushioned with soap opera suds and romantic comedy shtick in Thanks for Sharing.__This comedy is cringe-inducingly lame and the dramatic turns are visible as far in advance as utility poles on the prairie.__Blumberg juggles comedy and drama here before going predictably dark (as addict tales tend to do), but he's more circling his subject than nailing it down.__"Thanks for Sharing" has several nice moments and understated insights, but it never quite gets to the heart of its subject.__A well-meaning, sporadically entertaining and ultimately formulaic look at the struggles of a group of recovering sex addicts.__Most ... of the movie never transcends a screenwriting formula that makes you uncomfortably aware of the machinery driving it all.__Wait, wasn't this supposed to be a comedy? Or, if it's a drama, shouldn't these characters be more developed? Doesn't Ruffalo deserve a better movie? Don't we? So many questions; so little to see.__Though the film is tonally inconsistent, the overall empathy with which characters are presented, and some topnotch performances, help blunt the story's stumbling moments.__Blumberg is an efficient, easygoing storyteller.__Blumberg's film spends its running time showing us that sexual addiction is a disease like any other, and it does a convincing job. It's elsewhere that the film falters.__"Thanks for Sharing" is what Variety would call a "twelve-stepper"-an engagingly didactic drama about addiction and recovery.
Ed Harris and company can't lift this one off the seafloor, and "Phantom" fades away into the murky mist.__The film remains mediocre, with flat cinematography and crudely anachronistic dialogue.__A game effort by a decent cast highlights the old-fashioned submarine thriller "Phantom," but heavy-handed dialogue, flurries of melodrama and a silly ending make the whole enterprise sink like a stone.__It's not something you want to plunk down $12 for, but just diverting enough to check out when it arrives on Netflix Instant.__[Its] admirable air of realism dissipates once Robinson takes viewers outside the sub, where torpedo skirmishes are staged with too-perfect CGI bombast.__"Phantom" has a pulpy B-movie intensity and economy to match its cast of quality character actors.__The basis for the film's confusing, cliche-stuffed plot is the mysterious sinking of a Soviet submarine in 1968 - an event around which Mr. Robinson spins a yarn of unpardonable monotony.__A modest thriller propelled by a strong cast and straightforward storytelling.__As one might expect from a submarine drama, Phantom is claustrophobic and confining. If only it were compelling.__A challenge that offers zero rewards.__Phantom offers no more plausible a vision of the doomed K-129 than A Good Day to Die Hard does of post-meltdown Chernobyl.__Ed Harris in "Phantom" is like Steve Carlton with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1972 - delivering a wall-to-wall, amazing performance that's lost in a sea of dreadfulness.__The plot is dragged down by a script filled with awkward exposition and blunt audience cues.__A film that promises the threat of World War III sinks limply into the murky depths.__How did this submarine movie turn out so unseaworthy?__Much of what's contained in Phantom is at best speculative and at worst completely made-up. But, regardless of the accuracy, it makes for compelling viewing.__There's a lot to like about Phantom, but the movie, like the rust-bucket old submarine in which most of it takes place, would be better off dry-docked.__To sustain tension, you need the kind of claustrophobic camera movement, high-strung talk and gritty character development that are badly needed in any submarine movie and are sadly missing in Phantom.__What is up with combinations of Ed Harris, water, and unbelievably hokey endings?__As far as such potboilers go, Phantom is literate, tense and, thankfully, modest.
Daniel Radcliffe is back in a pair of nerdy specs as Allen Ginsberg in this sincere, heartfelt film about how the gay beat poet found his voice__Bursting with hipster attitude and New York atmosphere, the fact-based "Kill Your Darlings" is a coming-of-age chronicle that morphs into a crime story without missing a beat.__You don't need to know the Beats to understand "Kill Your Darlings," you just need to know the twinkling promise, and dark turns, of life.__Overall the movie seems to wander, like the worst excesses of free verse, needing a little structure to rein it in.__"Kill Your Darlings" is a true-crime murder mystery, a love letter to the wild-living artists of the Beat Generation, and a portrait of the artist as an adolescent.__Dramatizing a passion for the written word on film can be tricky, but in his feverish Kill Your Darlings, first-time director John Krokidas brings creative desire to life with vigor and emotion.__"Kill Your Darlings" occupies some in-between place, with young, intelligent actors working hard at being gritty as their director makes sure we see every ounce of effort.__Kill Your Darlings is a tale of inspiration, then, but also a tale of jealousy, obsession, homophobia, and homicide. It's a whirlwind.__A stylish-looking story that often presents the players as self-congratulating caricatures, overly proud of their own cleverness.__A lukewarm Radcliffe, plus a wandering script, make for a fair-to-middling movie, but the raw material of this dark corner of Beat history remains fascinating.__Ultimately ... two points of emphasis must be pared down to one, and this is where "Kill Your Darlings," arriving at the fork in the road, makes the wrong turn.__Though based on fact, the film is awash in delicious and difficult ambiguities.__That Ginsberg is played by Daniel Radcliffe might come as a shock, but the movie rolls on and you realize you're in very good hands.__This debut feature by New York University graduate John Krokidas outpaces most dramatic films about Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs, pushing back the legend enough to consider them as people.__Director and co-writer John Krokidas doesn't have a very fluent gift for period re-creation - everything seems stagy - and most of the actors, playing divas of various stripes, overact.__This vibrant portrait of a legendary New York bohemia in the 1940s transcends its flaws by evoking genuine feeling for poets in their youth.__A sort of Muppet Babies version of the Beat poets ...__The only thing it really kills is about an hour and a half.__Krokidas develops a nice rhythm - crucial for any film about the Beat movement - even if the composition feels a bit too meticulous.__Kill Your Darlings wants to be a young man's movie, but it's all "cinema du papa," as the French New Wave used to call it.
Set in a foster-care facility outside of San Francisco, this independent drama is vivid and heartfelt in its depiction of social work, at times recalling some of Frederick Wiseman's great documentary portraits.__The film's climax feels a little rushed and overwrought, but the movie's real resonance is its exploration of empathy and vocation.__At times Short Term 12 seems uncertain where it's going, but this matches the circumstances of both staff and residents.__There's heart, soul and personality to burn in 'Short Term 12' ... But this is a film that, like many of its young characters, desperately needs to calm down.__"Short Term 12" is a sly wonder of a film. It brings you into its unique world and then slowly reveals its characters, letting them unfold gradually, organically.__It's one of the best movies of the year and one of the truest portrayals I've ever seen about troubled teens and the people who dedicate their lives to trying to help them.__Short Term 12 captures the complex rhythms of institutional life -- for worker and inhabitant -- while weaving the story of Grace's journey through anguish toward, we hope, happiness.__"Short Term 12" may sound like confinement, but it's a redemptive and even funny film that invites us to stay and grow.__This surprising little sleeper will give you more big feelings in its first 15 minutes than every one of last summer's blockbusters combined.__Don't be put off by its forgettable title. Short Term 12 is a deeply memorable film.__"Short Term 12" is the kind of teen-oriented movie that's often dismissed as an "after-school special," but thanks to a nimble young cast it's frequently better than that.__Tender, funny and real as a kick in the ribs.__A compact masterpiece of storytelling that brims equally with ambition and humility. It is, by a wide margin, the best film I have seen so far this year.__This is a film about hurt and healing, isolation and fear, need and rage - and it's not just the motley, messed-up crew of 14- and 15-year-olds who are trying to cope, trying to get better.__Any director who sees "Short Term 12" will want to cast Larson in something. This movie puts her on the map.__It's a lovely, tough-minded film.__"Short Term 12" is that rare movie gutsy enough to tell the truth about love: that it's not a poetic longing or a magical-thinking happy ending, but a skill. And, the film suggests, we all have the capacity to learn it.__An emotionally authentic examination of the lives of those who live in and work at a children's home where the lines between the inhabitants and the caretakers isn't as clear as one might suppose.__This movie has the dash and esprit of service comedies like MASH and the harrowing emotions of misunderstood youth films like The 400 Blows.__An authentic drama couched in character that never stoops to manipulation.
Coming from anyone else, Ginger & Rosa would be a sensitive if predictable coming-of-age tale set in the mists of the distant past. But coming from writer-director Sally Potter, it's a major surprise.__A near-flawless film, beautifully shot and cut, excitingly performed and deeply felt.__Fanning is nearly perfect as Ginger navigates choppier waters than most teens have to. There is not a false note in her performance; no matter how melodramatic things become, everything about Ginger remains genuine.__Elle Fanning is scary. Scarily good.__In all respects, this is the completely captivating Fanning's picture.__Potter has a rich compositional eye, but she wisely trims the fat from the dialogue, which dances around most of the melodrama until an explosive last act.__What hurt, nuanced terror and exhilaration there is in Sally Potter's beautiful coming-of-age drama Ginger & Rosa.__Like Terence Davies's work, this is less about storytelling than immersing viewers in the minute details of an era -- what one of the film's characters describes as "the poetry of confinement."__Fanning, so ethereal yet fragile in "Somewhere" and so instinctive in "Super 8," was actually younger than her character while filming this, but she brings so much combined innocence and authority to the role, it's never noticeable.__In Potter's assured, caring hands, "the personal is political" assumes newfound breadth, depth and surprising emotional poignancy.__Sally Potter's twin interests - in grand world movements and in the grand internal movements in people lives - are effectively brought to bear in "Ginger & Rosa," her best film of the decade.__Elle's acting feels artless and naive, and all the more powerful for it. Fanning easily convinces you of Ginger's emotional reality - that every moment is the only moment.__You sense that this pale, growing-up-too-fast girl at its center will one day be a poet; finding words to convey what she can't yet say.__The film's tone is wonderfully maintained by Dakota Fanning's younger sister Elle as Ginger, convincingly playing 17 at the age of 13.__Packs an impressive amount of personal and political history into a wispy 90 minutes of screen time.__There's not a bad performance in the bunch.__Don't damn it with faint praise by calling it Potter's most "accessible" film. Simply call it what it is: One of her best, and perhaps her most deeply felt.__... it's the way that Fanning and Englert animate their characters that makes the movie special.__Fanning displays a dazzling naturalness on camera, an ability to move persuasively between any number of emotions, from hesitant to sassy to distraught to anything else you can name.__Ms. Potter puts her heroines in a succession of interesting-and handsomely photographed-situations in which they define themselves by talking about what they're up to, rather than by taking urgent action.
The gorgeous score and subtle visual craft save this entry in the Ghibli canon from mediocrity. But given what the studio is capable of, it's not everything fans will be hoping for.__A departure for Studio Ghibli - an emotionally nuanced, nostalgic look at the past that is grounded in everyday reality but retains the humor and delight that are part of the studio's trademark.__Goro Miyazaki has a style that's both more painterly and more cinematic than the cartoonish norm, while his father's screenplay is a classic coming-of-age story that seems suited for a live-action remake.__In the wisdom of this artfully rendered film, Umi and Shun - and the viewer - come to learn that the past and the future should go hand in hand, that the best way to move forward is to reflect, and respect, what came before.__The story of a girl grappling with first love, the absence of her parents and the anxieties of an on-rushing future in 1963 Yokohama has all the earmarks of a Miyazaki classic.__The film's perfectly fine, but it's not a patch on "Spirited Away," "My Neighbor Totoro," "Princess Mononoke," and other Studio Ghibli classics.__This is a gentle film, hand-drawn with irresistible colors, that exudes nostalgia in a lovely way.__Although simpler and less mysterious than the great Hayao Miyazaki movies, the gently melancholic From Up on Poppy Hill is still a must see at a time when family entertainment is too often synonymous with blandness.__Is there a Japanese word that combines "pretty," "demure" and "boring"?__Both genuinely emotional and blithely engaging.__The film maintains an optimistic tone without succumbing to nostalgia, and as always with Studio Ghibli, the company Miyazaki cofounded in the 80s, the hand-drawn animation is gorgeous.__From Up On Poppy Hill is at once old-fashioned and innovative, an exquisite evocation of Yokohama in 1963 that dares to treat teenagers with both gravity and grace.__Your kids may well fall in love with it, if you help them find it.__The artistry is peaceful and comforting to the eyes but not especially stirring. Given the pictorial extremes that Studio Ghibli has gone to in the past, "Up on Poppy Hill" is weak tea.__Likely to appeal to young audiences - especially teenagers - and possibly even to jaded adults, who may look back on their own first yearnings of puppy love with nostalgia and affection.__A film about many things-so many that the magic of Studio Ghibli's past has been displaced by exposition and earnest discussion.__The screenplay deftly balances the characters' intimate concerns with the nation's historic growing pains, resulting in a story that's as engrossing as the visuals are breathtaking.__"From Up on Poppy Hill" is frankly stunning, as beautiful a hand-drawn animated feature as you are likely to see.__It's the sort of movie that can prompt daydreams about inhabiting its world of flowers and hills, passing ships and harbor lights, where there's no Internet and romance happens face to face.__Its visual magic lies in painterly compositions of foliage, clouds, architecture and water, and its emotional impact comes from the way everyday life is washed in the colors of memory.
Lore, from Australian director Cate Shortland, proceeds like a long-ago fairy tale, dark-hued, grounded in real-life 20th-century horrors.__The young principals here, Malina and especially Rosendahl, are superb at conveying that premature hardening, their elastic minds pummelled by inelastic forces.__The sins of the Fatherland send a German teenage girl and her Nazi-connected family on the run in Australian director Cate Shortland's vividly rendered and sensual drama Lore.__It's a harrowing walk through the heart of darkness.__With a child's perspective on war, "Lore" deserves comparisons with "Empire of the Sun" and "Hope and Glory," and with a feisty female protagonist it stands virtually alone.__Saskia Rosendahl gives an impressively poised performance as the beautiful teenager, whose determination to protect her remaining family coincides with her growing revulsion toward her parents.__"Lore" is not a pretty story, but it is a good and sadly believable one.__"Lore" is not a love story, nor the story of a friendship. Rather, it's a story of healing and of how breaking, sometimes painfully, is often necessary before that process can begin.__A fiercely poetic portrait of a young woman staggering beyond innocence and denial, it's about the wars that rage within after the wars outside are lost.__Full of surprises, the movie draws a thin line between pity and revulsion - how would you feel if you had discovered your whole life had been based on lies?__It's a close, intimate film - sometimes so close you can feel the breath of its characters in your face.__We know where this is going pretty early on, but that doesn't prevent "Lore" from being riveting stuff, start to finish.__This striking, slow-building drama ... uses fractured, impressionistic imagery as a mirror of moral dislocation as the children make their way through an unfamiliar landscape.__It's a remarkable accomplishment.__Saskia Rosendahl is a highly expressive actress within the limited confines of her character, and the film is studded with memorable scenes.__"Lore" is the sort of movie you'd already expect to rip your heart out, but that doesn't diminish the tragedy when it does arrive.__If "Lore" is an upsetting and uncomfortable film set in a morally bleak landscape, it also offers a guardedly optimistic vision of the possibility of human change.__Saskia Rosendahl as Lore is the sturdiest in a good cast, making her way cautiously into a new, utterly changed universe.__The film sustains an air of overarching mystery in which the viewer, like the title character, is in the position of a sheltered child plunked into an alien environment and required to fend for herself without a map or compass.__A disconcerting and eerie film, made even more memorable since it's seen through the prism of childhood's end.
For a documentary about extreme discipline, the filmmakers lack restraint: the movie, about 20 minutes too long, undercuts much of its own momentum.__The oversized men who compete for the title of Mr. Olympia in this illuminating documentary are articulate and serious-minded, with some muscling through adversity to find a way to their dreams.__"Iron" opens a window to an exclusive club and gives valuable insight into a small, dedicated and proudly unique community.__Yudin's deft cameras admiringly capture these iconically sculpted men without overly objectifying them, should the prospect of eyeballing all that posing-strapped beef give any potential viewers pause.__A gorgeous meditation on age-old existential concerns.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Directors are always digging around in their psyches for material - David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Lars von Trier ... Refn's anxiety seems out to top theirs. But there's no joy or folly or transcendence. It's a one-dimensional video game of death.__Ryan Gosling and his "Drive" director, Nicolas Winding Refn, sail into the heart of darkness and emerge with a trinket of crackpot porno kitsch.__Style over substance doesn't really tell the half of it: you can bathe a corpse in groovy light and dress it in an expensive suit, but in the end that rotting smell just won't go away.__This is one of the most shocking and one of the best movies of the year.__Refn's nerve is admirable, even if his film often borders on unwatchable.__The most objectionable thing about Only God Forgives isn't that it's shocking or immoral, but that it's so finally, fatally dull.__The more arts-minded drag queens will be doing [Kristin Scott Thomas] this Halloween.__Mocking the improbable characters and bizarre juxtapositions is too literal and superficial a reading of this dreamy, entrancing movie.__I thought it was just about the worst ... thing I've ever seen. In fact, I was depressed it wasn't laughed off the screen.__Where Drive shrewdly mystifies, Only God Forgives stupefies. You can see its gears grinding. But I'll always hang on for a rare talent like Refn. Even when he stumbles, he leaves you eager to see what he's up to next.__I never had a doubt that director Nicolas Winding Refn was in absolute control.__Refn seems to have some issues he needs to work out, and "Only God Forgives" does as well. If it doesn't quite get all the way there, at least it's an interesting mess.__It's possibly the least glamorous and also least interesting role Gosling has ever had. It's not likely to expand his fan base much, or Refn's for that matter.__What makes it high art? The fact that it happens really slowly, I think, or that it's interspersed with patience-testing camera pans of wallpaper.__This is a ludicrous, showy film, and we are left to reconcile those two antagonistic qualities, or get out.__God may forgive you for seeing this needlessly brutal film. But you won't forgive yourself.__Nicolas Winding Refn's excruciatingly-though definitively-pretentious exercise in ritual violence gives chiaroscuro a bad name.__What is on Mr. Refn's mind? Here is what he says in a director's note: "The original concept for the film was to make a movie about a man who wants to fight God." All right. Whatever.__"Only God Forgives" is the kind of remarkable disaster only a very talented director can make after he finds success and is then allowed to do whatever he wants.__As always, Refn's style is captivating, but the fascination with extreme gore never amounts to more than a fetish, and there's none of the deft characterization that made his revered Pusher trilogy and British biopic Bronson so engaging.
Hannah Arendt is ultimately a pleasure, because Sukowa plays the most forbidding of intellectuals as a fabulous, passionate doll.__Barbara Sukowa delivers a beautifully modulated performance, showing the rigor of Arendt's thought and convictions while revealing the contours of a passionate woman with complex relationships.__[Barbara Sukowa] invests Arendt with a steely fury, but the film, set during and after the 1961 trial of ex--Nazi official Adolf Eichmann, has an entertaining cocktail-banter superficiality.__Like A Hidden Method, David Cronenberg's drama about Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Hannah Arendt takes seriously the life of the mind.__In an era of sleepwalking surrender, "Hannah Arendt" is a welcome wake-up call, a ringing reminder that warring forces first assemble on the battlefield of conscience.__Balanced portrayal, makes a persuasive case that Arendt was a valuable voice, whose dedicated work in trying to unravel the causes of Europe's moral collapse was worthy of study and consideration.__A film that ultimately says more about banality than evil.__[A] moving examination of the limits of human understanding when confronted with evil.__Hannah Arendt is hagiography of the most egregious kind. It makes Lincoln look like a smear job.__Mixed bag, fascinating in its treatment of the Eichmann case, but stilted in its treatment of Arendt and her coterie.__Sukowa, who is very appealing in some personal moments in the film, makes Arendt strong in a cool, logical, but humanly unrealistic position.__Barbara Sukowa's performance in the title role is the kind that reverberates long after the screen goes black.__Von Trotta includes actual footage of Eichmann's trial, simultaneously trivializing it and diminishing the rest of the movie to the vanishing point.__It's involving, as biopics go, but the shattering debates that still swirl around Arendt's view of the Holocaust are relegated to walk-ons.__It's the actual courtroom footage that's the most effectively deep and ambiguous thing in this well-crafted but static biopic.__Once we get to the Eichmann trial and its aftermath, it's mesmerizing.__A mildly intriguing drama of the often unavoidable and contentious intersection of intellectual analysis and personal prejudices.__My only real problem with "Hannah Arendt" is that it's not a mini-series.__Being accused of rationalizing the Third Reich and disowned by Zionist friends doesn't provide a lot of drama, but the relentless focus on figuring out how we are to think about the Final Solution can be compelling.__The writer-philosopher Hannah Arendt is brought to life by a mesmerizing Barbara Sukowa in Margarethe von Trotta's film.
This suffers as well from the fact that the subjects' lives haven't changed all that much since 49 Up (2005); perhaps the series will improve yet as they head into old age.__The original documentary was intended to illustrate how the country's deeply ingrained class system inscribed itself on the aspirations and inner lives of its young people. But the successive movies have been far less polemical.__We're now at 56 Up,, and with each passing calendar leap, the experience of watching has only become more soul-stirring.__Yes, on some level it's just a seven-year check-in with people maybe half-remembered, if that. Yet the films also serve as a kind of check-in with us, too.__What ultimately is so compelling about 56 Up is the universality of the experiences. We were all once children. And we all will die. And in between, there is everything else.__We feel good, refreshed and depressed in watching these people get older, also embarrassed in moments and cautioned about the passage of time.__Apted skillfully weaves old footage with the new, and we become poignantly aware of another factor shaping their lives (and our own): biology, as the we watch the once-cute kids grow gray and heavy.__Apted, himself now in his early 70s, says he hopes to continue the series further. Long may it live.__Watching "56 Up" gives you the wonderful feeling of seeing a sociological experiment blossom into something novelistically rich and humane.__Time has been neither kind nor cruel to the 13 men and women profiled in "56 UP." It has just been time, which is what this groundbreaking series is about.__We are all older now, and this series proves it in a most deeply moving way.__Inevitably, one looks in the mirror afterward and thinks, What have I lost? What have I gained? And at what cost?__To see "56 Up" is to be reunited with an old friend.__"56 Up" reminds us that change is ceaseless and often dramatic, bringing growth we could never have dreamed of as little kids.__Apted creates a graceful back-and-forth from the earlier films to the present, and the experience of seeing people who have lived so much on screen is quite profound.__The effect is often profoundly moving, but you can't help but feel at times like there are other stories here you're missing.__What gives the series its force is not just its universality but also its particularity. These grown-ups may be Everyman, but they are also singular.__"56 Up" is a rather bittersweet chapter, as age begins to further narrow those possibilities already defined at birth. And it hints that "63 Up," if we get there, may be sadder still.__'56 Up" is as good a point as any to get hooked on the magnificent half-century series of documentaries ...__These are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space.
Hall's backstory, riddled with tragedy, gets the proper attention and respect here. But it's the music that won't let you stop watching.__The movie is more a collection of cool people telling great stories than it is a structured documentary (despite Camalier's attempts in that direction). But in this case, that's enough.__Director Greg "Freddy" Camalier augments the talking heads with unusually evocative vistas ...__Occasionally baggy, always sincere, this is an essential document of a defining era when 'soul' really meant something.__Even casual music fans will enjoy behind-the-hits doc.__Greg Camalier's debut feature offers a worthy if sometimes ponderous take on a significant slice of U.S. popular music history.__What makes the documentary Muscle Shoals so fine besides a kicking soundtrack? Well first, there's its deep sense of place.__It is hands down one of the best music documentaries ever made.__A mesmerizing documentary ...__Like 20 Feet From Stardom, another standout music doc of 2013, Muscle Shoals skillfully shines a light on unheralded musicians whose names usually are not illuminated.__It's mandatory viewing for fans of the classic rock, soul and rhythm and blues of the 1960s and '70s.__[An] alternately maddening and magnificent documentary.__Even fans who don't know Muscle Shoals by name know its music by heart. Now they can also see how much soul went into it.__Director Greg "Freddy" Camalier skillfully, unhurriedly unfurls a wealth of classic music-biz tales as told by a who's who of R&B, soul and rock 'n' roll royalty and various other players and purveyors.__"Muscle Shoals" is filled with great stories, characters and songs -- and, really, what else could you want from a music documentary?__Do not leave the film until the last credit rolls by.__The film runs a tad long (just under two hours) and could stand another edit, but Mick, Keith, Bono and Aretha are on a roll, man.__Just as "Sweet Home Alabama" speaks for itself without revealing its meaning, so does this American story of ferment and feuding and amazing pop music.__[A] charming, reverently shot ramble.__It might have functioned even better as an hour-long TV documentary. But with such great music coming, one hit after after another, it's always a joy to watch.
Kennedy specialists will glean nothing new, and those hoping for sobriety will flinch at the camera's intrusions.__This episodic drama is set in Dallas during the three days after the JFK assassination, and some of it is highly charged.__Somehow, all this commotion adds up to aimless inertia, in part because the movie lacks a point of view - let alone anything fresh to propose about the assassination or its peripheral players.__Takes one of the most traumatizing events of the American 20th century and turns it into a trivia digest.__Parkland is history as existential despair.__For those who remember that dark day, it will inevitably have impact. But this was too much of a story for one film.__I can see this film being shown in high school, as a way to fill up two-or-three periods. But I can't see anyone wanting to see it on their own. Especially if they already lived through it once.__Fifty years after the traumatic event, the assassination of JFK is still capable of touching a raw nerve -- even in a dramatization as flat-footed as this one.__There's something to be said for Landesman's attempt to limit himself to just the facts that we can all agree on. Just that much is dramatic enough and awful enough to make for a good movie.__"Parkland" succeeds as it fails. For whatever its flaws, it is unforgettable.__You're left wondering why it was made.__A collection of powerful scenes that somehow add up to something less than powerful.__This star-studded docudrama about President Kennedy's assassination and its aftermath focuses on fascinating, relatively obscure stories, but fails to organize them into effective and revealing drama.__The events of those days would have been better covered in greater depth in a miniseries, rather than a 90-minute movie.__Parkland is wildly uneven, although compulsively watchable.__Peter Landesman's well-made but dramatically unfocused re-creation of that November day and its aftermath ...__The assassination of John F. Kennedy, as seen through the eyes of bystanders, insiders and other players.__There are 8 million stories in this naked tragedy. Parkland is content to tell parts of some of them.__It's sober, responsible and rather humdrum.__Methodically and with generally unfailing good restraint, Landesman re-creates the grief surrounding the crime and the confusion of Oswald's capture and subsequent murder.
Malick is employing his usual style of montage and voice-over narration but in a new, contemporary setting that makes Wonder feel like his most vital work in years.__Love is a many-splendored thing, except when it isn't in To the Wonder, a wispy romantic movie about the death of a romance.__What is most affecting is Malick's intent. He plainly devised the story to give him a series of panels for the expression of feeling.__The movie plays like an undercooked pie that hasn't had enough time to cool and settle.__Essentially it's an agglomeration of Malick's worst stylistic annoyances.__A thing of great beauty, but not much more.__We should not be exiting a Terrence Malick movie with a shrug, but there it is.__Chary of exposition, meagre of plot, derisory of dialogue, indifferent to comprehension, it's a project that veers perilously close to self-parody.__Mostly, it's solemn intonations of bad poetry over open-field twirling scenes and long serious looks of love, tenderness and cosmic understanding.__"To the Wonder" is a trailer for itself, although it could be mistaken for a high-end perfume commercial ...__There's a little too much wonder and not quite enough story in this middling effort from Terrence Malick.__Does it deserve to be seen? Absolutely. Just be aware of what you're getting into.__"To the Wonder" finds Malick pursuing a form of visual storytelling that is closer to chamber music, or symphonic rapture, than conventional film narrative.__To the Wonder suggests the creep of doubt and possibly even despair into Malick's cosmic questing. This may not be as profound as he intends - to be human is to forever question - but it makes for stimulating viewing.__The individually ravishing but loosely bound shots reduce whatever weight the story might have to the trivial narcissism of Caribbean-travel commercials.__There are moments of pure poetry in the movie but the production as a whole seems overlong and repetitive and takes a detour or two that distract from the aching beauty of the central story.__There's little doubt this film will deepen, open up with a second viewing. But to what end?__It serves up real emotion, and striking grace. It has moments of simple beauty, and thorny questions.__The cinematography here is enough to make you swoon. Would that the story were equally compelling.__There is no new ground, really, the distinction is in the way Malick covers it with glorious imagery, symphonies of sound, a cacophony of moods.
Salinger triumphs, though, as an absorbing portrait of a singular man of mystery.__Too bad that Salinger offers no real insight into the elusive writer and is fueled almost entirely by trivial anecdotes.__The movie has a shallow, paparazzo literalism. It just wants to catch the legendarily reclusive Salinger getting into a Jeep.__What emerges is a portrait of an enigma.__Where Salinger succeeds is in the gripping section on World War II, and in the exquisite, often melancholy details in the stories told by the likes of Joyce Maynard.__The treatment of J.D. Salinger's writing in this overwrought documentary is so inflated and pompous it comes as a relief when Judd Apatow shows up to describe The Catcher in the Rye as a funny book filled with great lines.__A good documentary can lead you to a place of not knowing what to believe about a subject. A bad documentary tells you what to believe, and why, but in ways provoking disbelief in the movie's tactics.__This documentary reconstructing the life of the ultimate cult author is like a three-act thriller, and the character at the center of the story is a mute man of mystery.__When [Salerno] drops the stylistic overkill and lets these people talk about Salinger, what emerges is a riveting picture of a contradictory, deeply selfish, troubled man.__Cataloging what's missing from Salerno's movie -- for instance, why "The Catcher in the Rye" worked, or didn't, and what it meant and still means to the American novel -- would run into the sports section.__The movie epitomizes everything in the culture from which Salinger himself fled. It is, as Holden Caulfield would put it, phony.__A fluffed-up documentary that sticks it to the already famously flawed author without providing much revelation.__A fascinating picture of one of the 20th century's most enigmatic writers, a man who retreated from public life only to be pursued by prying fans.__Salinger is fascinating because Salinger was fascinating. But the film is frustrating, maddeningly so, because it is bent on trumpeting its own importance over that of its subject.__Given the many stories about Salinger and the dearth of images, it would have been more efficient just to skip the documentary altogether.__Salerno's 10-year trawl through Salinger's closely guarded life gets repetitive, since there are no known film interviews or audiotapes of the author to draw on.__Any insights the film has to impart about the writing process are delivered in embarrassingly literal fashion.__Salinger is self-important, redundant, and interminable.__"Salinger" is all surface.__By turns fascinating and infuriating.
Sommer is perfect. So is O'Hara. This is the "Before Sunrise" for a very different (and platonic) pair of individuals.__Amid all the looking and dissection, Cohen demonstrates an understanding of the individual need for increasingly elusive privacy that feels urgent, wistful, and quaint.__The quiet time that Johann and Anne spend during museum hours -- and after his shifts on trips around the city -- offer solace in their mutual solitude. Museum Hours is an introverted companion for its viewers.__The two leads contribute fresh, genuine performances, and what might have been a musty academic exercise gains in tension from Cohen's deft juxtaposing of vocal narration, character detail, and majestic artwork.__It's as if Cohen had lived for centuries among these places, and sometimes with art that encapsulates these centuries, and is pleasantly imprisoned within its strength.__It has its tedium, but it's not bad. At times, it's actually quite good.__Cohen's spare but spectacularly visualized film follows a pair of middle-aged strangers who meet in a Viennese art museum and proceed to walk and talk.__Its encouragement to let ourselves be captivated by everyday humanity as well as the old masters is both richly illuminating and quirkily endearing.__An enthralling and sometimes droll meditation on life, art and mortality, not to mention Internet porn and its influence on modern art.__"Museum Hours" is every bit as masterfully conceived and executed as the art works that serve as the film's lively cast of supporting characters.__Difficult to describe but not to enjoy.__A lot of it works, some of it doesn't.__One of the world's great art museums, the Kunsthistoriches is the true star of the movie "Museum Hours."__It's a hybrid drama/art-history essay about how looking at art recasts our experience of looking at the world.__The languid pace, long silences and lack of purpose and dramatic tension will leave some looking at their watches.__It finds the time to look at looking, and to offer a slow revelation: to the lonely and the stranded, it is art that feels like home.__The film shows how quiet exteriors can mask deep interior lives, and how art feeds those lives.__This movie is rigorously and intensely lifelike, which is to say that it's also a strange and moving work of art.__Ultimately, the movie's easygoing narrative turns to loss, but without melodrama. An awareness of life and art offers perspective, and perhaps a measure of consolation.__Museum Hours is less interested in plot than in using its characters as a way to give ideas shape and voice; however, because their performances are natural and improvisatory, the movie never seems didactic.
It's a timely narrative subject, but its treatment in The Reluctant Fundamentalist is fundamentally flawed.__Nair has found a real gem in Riz Ahmed, who anchors the film with a charismatically watchable performance. He's in virtually every frame and you hang on his every word.__Ambiguity is at the heart of the novel, but Nair is never quite sure what to do with it.__As a culture-clash story the film works well enough, but as a character study it's a bit of a scramble.__It most disappoints as a thriller, the flashbacks and voiceovers and romantic entanglements so dominating the proceedings you forget that someone is bound and gagged in real time.__There's much to enjoy in 'The Reluctant Fundamentalist': fine photography, juicy supporting turns from Kiefer Sutherland and Om Puri, and a powerfully sustained sense of a man adrift in a world going mad.__This sure-handed adaptation of Mohsin Hamid's international best seller shows Nair at her best.__Deliberately ambiguous, "The Reluctant Fundamentalist" provides just enough answers while leaving us with more than enough questions.__Despite the charismatic efforts of the British actor Ahmed, The Reluctant Fundamentalist gets bogged down in proselytizing and plot.__Takes [the book's] riveting tale and flattens it, blunting much of the nuance that made it a great read.__Handsomely crafted and smartly performed, the film works on its own terms. But in expanding the story's canvas, it dilutes rather than translates the power of the book.__Fairly insightful as a drama, but barely adequate as a thriller. Ahmed is pitch-perfect as the conflicted hero, but he's in two movies that cancel each other out.__Nair's film draws a clear parallel between violent Islamic fundamentalism and job-destroying capitalist economic fundamentalism, and firmly rejects both. If only good intentions made up for heavy-handed dramatics.__Nair is so busy making sure we never lose sympathy for her handsome and charming protagonist that the film ultimately founders in a tangle of humanist platitudes.__It's a dogged, thoughtful and well-acted movie that might have been more effective if it kept a narrower focus.__Timeliness is certainly on the side of Mira Nair's uneven but fascinating The Reluctant Fundamentalist.__A movie imposing in its breadth and depth.__Alas, the film's relevance - and ultimately sane upshot - is buried beneath a meandering and oft-implausible plot.__By literalizing the idea of American military aggression and all that it implies Ms. Nair doesn't just invest Mr. Hamid's story with Hollywood-style beats, she also completely drains it of ambiguity.__The movie's failures are all the more unfortunate because they detract from its central and conspicuous success, the performance of Riz Ahmed in the title role.
No, it's not hard-hitting journalism about retail fashion or conspicuous consumption. It's more like a graceful authorized biography of an institution.__There's probably a brilliant documentary to be made at New York department store Bergdorf Goodman. No such luck__The overall feel is less of a cohesive documentary and more of a slapdash scrapbook of facts, historical information and name-dropping.__Much of the window dressing has gone out of fashion. It's nice to revisit it here.__As a sociological exercise, it's like another culture. As a film, it's like science fiction, a visit to Planet Obscenely Wealthy. It is weirdly compelling.__A fascinating doc that accurately captures the luster of the venerated fashion mecca and shows why Bergdorf's has become an American institution ...__A gloriously gilded wonderland - the stuff of dreams, on view for everyone.__[A] fawning documentary, bankrolled by Goodman descendant Andrew Malloy ...__Yes, the store has managed to attract big spenders for more than a century, but the film reveals that there is as much richness in good anecdote as a painstakingly conceived window vignette.__Piles on the designers and insiders, making no lasting impression other than to spark musings on the folly of excess.__This is an infomercial disguised as mildly entertaining cinema.__[Prefers] to polish the marble of the block-long Bergdorf Goodman store rather than look past it. Still, for die-hards, peeking into back halls and hearing the dish will satisfy.__Jumps skittishly from subject to subject, disjointed and repetitive for all but dyed-in-the-wool fashionistas.__There's so much material that's amusing, and so much goodwill for Bergdorf in the hearts of fashion lovers, that it's a shame this is such an ADD sprawl of a movie.__[A] glossy, fawning valentine to conspicuous consumption ...__Though partly funded by one of the descendants of the store's founder, director Matthew Miele has made a lively, clever, fast-moving film that isn't overly reverential about its subject.__The energy in "Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's"-what a great title!-is genuine, infectious and superabundant.__Granted, not every documentary is necessarily required to dig up dirt and say awful things, but the overbearing gush gets tiresome.__You don't have to be in vogue to enjoy this stylish ride through Bergdorf's. It's a surprise package to die for.__This glossy doc is indisputably attractive, with lots of famous faces, amusing stories and stunning clothes to admire.
New World tries to expand the genre with nods to The Godfather but can't escape the over-the-top acting, expansive violence and overdone story typical of Seoul-made crime dramas.__"New World" is both less bloody and more thoughtful than most of its genre, the shifting-alliances plot becoming more engrossing as it progresses.__No one in American movies has made a crime opera this good in years.__Writer-director Hoon-jung Park tells this twisty story of internecine warfare within a Korean corporate crime syndicate with patience, elegance and no small amount of bloodshed.__Like many of his SK-action peers, director Park Hoon-jung has a knack for staging violent set pieces but comes up lacking in terms of character development, narrative clarity, etc.__Park's direction is sleek and assured, but lacking the dynamism that might help energize a film that-its title notwithstanding-comes off as dully old-school.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
What the movie points to is worth following until you're left with an enormous map that you spend the rest of the drive trying to refold.__Carruth's visual approach, saved from abstraction by his own rapid, forward-leaping editing, is extremely assured. Seimetz is a fine and expressively haunted actress. I look forward to the enigmas in Carruth's next picture.__If the movie is a bit of a mystery, so is Carruth.__Should you see Upstream Color? A better question may be: How many times should you see it?__The most visually imaginative American film since David Lynch's Eraserhead.__A cerebral, mournful mystery that resonates like a tuning fork struck on a far-off star.__It presents us with a glimpse of the vastness of existence, of our inner nature, and of nature without that is as equally dreadful, enveloping, and terrifying as it is beautiful.__"Upstream Color" is splendid, transcendent weirdness.__I loved it.__Sci-fi might have been too familiar a word, for what may induce a kind of hallucinatory melancholy in its viewers.__Elliptical and utterly fascinating adventure in cinema, one that defies simple explanations, but worms its way into the brain.__Taken as a whole, it's an impressive piece of filmmaking that shows Carruth's talents as director, actor, cinematographer and composer.__Carruth may be something that the movies haven't yet seen, perhaps the first great realization of the democratization of filmmaking that digital technology and the Internet promised.__Upstream Color is a deliberate exercise in swooning obscurity. You either go with its considerable sensory powers or you scratch a groove on your head.__Being completely understood at first glance is not on creator Shane Carruth's agenda, but while this may sound upsetting, it turns out to be quite the opposite.__Visually and sonically hypnotic, it's an intensely sensory blend of internal monologue and unsettling mystery, draped over a thin skeleton of plot approached so obliquely that it seems almost inconsequential.__No one else today approaches the genre in quite this way; the only precedent I can think of is Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth.__While I feel compelled to see it again, I don't have high hopes that it will make any more sense.__Meanings are multiple, debatable and ultimately pointless. What really impresses about Upstream Color is Carruth's confident navigation of this fast river of ideas ...__This enigma-delivery system from a sharp mind has enthralling moments but becomes a bit enervating in its self-seriousness. By the end, the whole thing feels more academic than mind-bending.
In Sound City, a raucous yet sweetly romantic documentary, dinosaurs do indeed rock the Earth again.__Dave Grohl's terrific new doc, Sound City, profiles the studio where some of the greatest music of the past four decades was born.__A joyous ode to a lost era of music making that will delight music buffs and those who appreciate a well-done documentary.__A cocky, affectionate and very musical documentary that may make its central point a few times too often.__In his directing debut, Dave Grohl shows the instincts of a real filmmaker. Sound City hits you like a shot in the heart.__Even if you don't know what [Grohl's] talking about when he says a room gives "great decay," or when somebody else extols "24-track sensibility," the passion of this project really pops right out of the groove.__If it doesn't break any ground as a documentary, it's a heartfelt testament to a place he considers among the most hallowed halls of rock.__High-spirited, emotional and funny, "Sound City" is, of all things, a mash note to a machine. Not just any machine, however, but one that helped change the face of rock 'n' roll.__A celebration of just how unbelievably awesome it is to make rock music for a living - not to mention being so successful at it that you can get your childhood heroes to come over and jam.__Grohl's aim is to explore the aura of a place, but what he winds up proving is that people make the magic.__I didn't jump out of my chair and pump my fist till 24 minutes in.__Dave Grohl remains unflappable as a first-time director in his entertaining and informative documentary Sound City, a loving tribute to a defunct Van Nuys recording studio.__Mr. Grohl has put a lot of affection into this film, and it shows.__Grohl treats us to just more than an hour celebrating the history of Sound City, the Van Nuys dump where a clutch of rock's great records were bashed out-but the movie's 107 minutes long.__The first-time director smartly sees Sound City as a surrogate for the overall industry at any given point in the past four decades, and he varies the tone of the interviews from fondly-regarded serendipity to deep-seated regret.__The beautiful thing here is the way Sound City enlivens some fairly snobby ideas about the glories of analog tape without resorting to mere mansplaining.__An exhilarating history of the studio that spawned countless rock classics, not to mention a welcome reminder to aspiring musicians to step away from the laptop once in a while.__None__None__None
It's an unshowy, quietly intense drama with grace notes in every scene -- and a hellish punch.__A high-seas hostage-taking and resulting negotiations are absorbingly dramatized in this low-key Venice standout from Denmark's hottest new writer-director.__A nail-biter of a thriller that eschews conventional thrills, Tobias Lindholm's verite-like tale of a Danish cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates is rivetingly low-key.__A finely spun tale that eschews sensationalism to focus on the human toll on the captives, their families and their employers back home.__This isn't an action picture; it's a picture about the suspense and terror of inaction.__Gripping and tightly focused.__Lindholm rations the meat and potatoes of plot to keep us captive at the bargaining table. It's a sadistic ploy that produces a real payoff.__A Hijacking is one of those perfect films that crop up every few years to prove that with true artistry, even the most exhausted genre can yield something new, rich, and strange.__Lindholm justifies his confidence in a visual approach that's refreshingly realistic.__To refuse to call A Hijacking a thriller is not to say it isn't thrilling, in a dryly cerebral way.__It's the second feature from the young writer-director Tobias Lindholm, and it showcases his gift for tightly focused stories told without an ounce of fat.__Lindholm doesn't present the film as a procedural for hostage negotiations because he knows too well that there are too many movable parts, too many things that can go wrong.__Methodical and tense ... has the feel of something based on real-life events ... boils down to an arresting portrait of two men, with different backgrounds and abilities, doing everything they can not to break.__This absorbing chronicle of a hijacking in the Indian Ocean has the strengths of the best procedural dramas -- it assumes a distanced and objective tone and packs an emotional wallop.__We're impatient for action, any kind of action - but preferably the sort that involves a team of Navy SEALs, maybe led by Dwayne Johnson. Instead, we get something like a merger meeting.__Hand-held camerawork, so often a confounded nuisance, here makes the conditions on board the Rozen feel nauseatingly urgent.__No mainstream American thriller could ever be made about this subject that resisted simple-minded narrative cliches the way "A Hijacking" does, or that refused to depict its characters as either heroes or villains.__Lindholm turns tedium and frustration into agonizing suspense.__"A Hijacking" is as lean, focused and to the point as its title.__This feature film shows how much tension, telling detail and sheer dramatic expertise can be squeezed into a running time of less than two hours.
A slow, banjo-string-tight thriller ... Bodies gets under your skin and stays there.__This Sundance-sanctioned, love-on-the-run melodrama is indie filmmaking of a deliberately timeless sort.__A lyrical modern Western that casts a contemporary but un-jaded eye on the romantic mythology of outlaw couples.__Writer-director David Lowery strains for poetry at every turn, and only the strain registers.__Lowery has a lyrical style of storytelling that is delicate and subtle yet suffused with emotion and atmosphere. It's gentle and pointed at the same time.__It is not a large film. But Lowery may well be a large talent, and he sure knows how to cast the right actors.__Lowery has a way with actors, though. As a local sheriff with an eye for Ruth, Ben Foster is excellent and, in a too-small role as a grizzled shopkeeper, Keith Carradine proves himself yet again to be one of our finest performers.__A loping and lovely romance, steeped in tragedy, with a Texas twang.__The tone never changes. Scenes aren't inflected, and when the end comes, it registers, but without much impact.__On its own terms, Saints conjures a mood of stoic obsession at the service of a tale older than the Hill Country dirt it calls home.__A repository of fugitive Americana that's substantial and satisfying.__It feels raw, and real, and sets a tone that is sustained throughout.__The characters are too ordinary to care deeply for and the story doesn't add up to much, but Lowery has made a shrine to his actors, to the land through which they move, and to the kind of cinema that once sustained us.__A slow-moving story of devotion, obsession and Texas justice.__The feel of the movie is intimate and handmade, as if Lowery were renewing, lovingly and poignantly, the landscape's ruined landmarks and infusing them with his own memories and dreams.__As Ain't Them Bodies Saints moves along, its elliptical approach to drama goes from keeping us on our toes to dulling everything down.__It's a gorgeous film to behold, but writer-director David Lowery gets so wrapped up in the visuals that the storytelling lags at critical moments.__This is a hell of a film, a marvelous experience, far more beautiful than sentimental, so long as you don't have to have a mind made up for you.__A muted but always engrossing tale of young, doomed love.__Lowery put 90 percent of his energy into the atmosphere and 10 percent into the script.
[A] gripping investigative doc, which plays out like a classic conspiracy thriller as it follows a trail of clues to the heart of darkness.__It makes you wonder - what don't we know?__By emphasizing the human cost of the operation, Scahill and Rowling turn "blowback" into much more than an abstract military-political term.__These wars being fought in our name may be dirty, but this courageous film reminds us that as long as we have a free press, they don't have to be secret.__Dirty Wars is essential viewing for all Americans, conservatives and liberals alike. It's intense and depressing. It'll make you angry.__Scahill is as much a liability onscreen as he is a fascinating source.__A remarkable documentary as important as it is compelling ...__"Dirty Wars" becomes hard to swat away, no matter how much its style conveys a sense of unconscious insecurity about its assertions.__Scahill's so busy Being A Reporter - capital letters are definitely called for - it gets in the way of what he's reporting on.__The flood of theatrical documentaries about the War on Terror... has slowed to a trickle since President Obama took office, which makes this uncompromising expose from reporter Jeremy Scahill even more important.__For every shot of an Afghani citizen talking tearfully about the death of a loved one, there's almost always an equally long shot of Jeremy Scahill listening, Jeremy Scahill taking notes, Jeremy Scahill furrowing his brow.__An expose of practices that need -- demand -- exposing.__The film will undoubtedly play well with those who already despise the covert killings, but it does a disservice to the wavering.__It's shocking stuff, even if much of it has already been in the news. That's mostly because of the way that Scahill strings it together into a coherent, convincing argument.__Pessimistic, grimly outraged and utterly riveting ...__Scahill is right to focus on the price American security efforts have cost in human rights - and human life. Yet there are difficult questions hovering just outside the frame of Dirty Wars.__As a connect-the-dots narrative, "Dirty Wars" is eye-opening, a fierce argument that there are chilling ramifications to endless, vague aggression.__As a polemic, Dirty Wars is provocative and productively depressing ...__Dirty Wars is essential viewing for anyone who wants to know how we wage war right now; it's also a chilling prologue for what's likely a global future of endless war and blowback.__Dirty Wars leaves some deeper questions unexplored, mainly the philosophical struggle between security and secrecy, but makes up grandly with raw data and one correspondent's passion.
What will take your breath away is how viciously Armstrong crushed and humiliated anyone who dared to make allegations against him,__While the movie includes enough details about the physiology, strategy and marketing of bike racing to satisfy some of our curiosity, other questions remain unanswered.__The tale has plenty of resonance off the race course. As sportswriter Dan Coyle says in the film, "It's not a story about doping, it's a story about power."__"The Armstrong Lie" simply offers up the Armstrong lie. Sorry, but we've all already heard that one.__The Armstrong Lie is eye-opening and myth-shattering and more than a little depressing.__Gibney gives the truth as full an airing as seems humanly possible, given that the subject is a world-class liar.__The bitterest parts of Gibney's movie are the interviews with the former teammates who were caught doping, and whom Armstrong, when he was still officially clean, viciously turned on.__Gibney took a film that was supposed to be about the resurrection of a sports star and turned it into an epic indictment of one man and an entire culture. The lesson is obvious: Never throw anything out.__While there are no new explosive revelations in The Armstrong Lie - and, at just over two hours, it's a touch too long - it's still a mesmerizing cautionary tale.__The movie captures a very modern approach to public scandal: Confession without remorse.__There's a palpable sense of sadness, more than outrage or betrayal, to the film.__To look at Armstrong as he semi-justifies his decisions is to see the definition of arrogance. He defies you to challenge him, as he has done for so long.__You'd have to start looking into ancient Greek tragedy to top it as a showcase for pure, unadulterated hubris. That's one of the things that makes The Armstrong Lie, which has more on its mind than the mere debunking of a tarnished hero, so worthwhile.__None of the athlete's words really answer Gibney's central question. Perhaps we're just supposed to see it in his eyes.__The Armstrong Lie is one of the best batches of lemonade ever made from a severely bruised lemon.__Gibney assembles a damning case against the athlete, but what distinguishes this from other accounts of the scandal is the filmmaker's admission that, while shooting a documentary about Armstrong's 2009 comeback, he smothered his own innate skepticism.__To mixed success, "The Armstrong Lie" allows Gibney generous time and space to explain what sort of movie he started out to make and what kind of confessional he ended up making.__"The Armstrong Lie" is truly singular, a tale of ambition that's almost mad enough to be mythic.__Mr. Armstrong, for all his gifts and hard work, emerges as a hollow man, corrupted by glory, protecting what remains of his reputation.__Overall, Gibney does a fine job documenting the timeless nature of Armstrong's fall from grace.
The disappointment and malaise of a modern farmer's life comes through, but almost as an afterthought. As Bahrani makes clear, it's worth a more focused film.__Bahrani fills the frame with weathered faces and "At Any Price" feels like it unfolds in something close to the real America. But he wants to give us larger-than-life drama, and his strengths are life-sized.__Bahrani seems less interested in getting at the heart of a man who has sold his soul than he is in showing how the hard facts of modern farming have literally and figuratively changed the landscape.__Written and played with a little more subtlety, Henry and his contradictions could have been fascinating; as it is, "At Any Price" keeps us at a distance, gazing at characters who never quite come to life.__Like the small farmers forced to kowtow to corporations, writer and director Ramin Bahrani chickens out. His melodramatic script reduces a global conflict to a Grain Belt "Glengarry Glen Ross."__It clumsily showcases an environmental issue -- in this case, the corporate strong-arm tactics used to promote GMOs -- through routine interpersonal drama.__If the story is a bit all over the place - and what the heck is Heather Graham doing in this picture besides looking great? - the solid work from Quaid and Efron helps iron out a few of the bumpy bits.__Bahrani aims at a wider audience than his previous films have reached so far, but in the process he has sacrificed much of his artisanal, personal approach.__In the end, "At Any Price" strikes a dark, even ghastly tone, and rather suddenly it becomes a cynical commentary on small-town hypocrisy and American business. It's hard to tell whether that was the intention.__It may be saying some true things about the new world of cutthroat agriculture, but it says them in a singularly unconvincing way.__A viewer is constantly aware of how much everyone is striving. It's the cinematic equivalent of a stranger who trips all over themselves in an effort to become your new best friend.__It's one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, and not in a particularly good way.__The narrative takes a surprising turn, leading to a troubling and, I think, successful third act. Most uneven pictures have a way of fading to gray in the final lap; this one actually gets better as it goes.__Bahrani is a gifted filmmaker. But he shoots himself in the foot by throwing in a contrived plot device that creates drama at the expense of credibility.__Feels like a series of note cards ("father-son conflict," "dad's mistress hits on son") that never weave together to make a gripping plot.__It's powerful stuff.__Easy resolutions compete with preposterous melodrama.__The dialogue and performances in At Any Price are about at the level of a Founders' Day pageant.__The film hasn't quite earned the grim resonance it seeks.__With its fine eye for detail, At Any Price is also a complicated and revelatory look at the intersection of country folk and corporate might.
Will do little to crystallize the convoluted picture of how the Catskills had a lasting impact on comedy.__Shapeless and generic.__If you can overlook [the] unfortunate stuff, and a cornball windup, what's left is fascinating and funny.__The film is slight at 77 minutes, and not all that funny.__It answers that age-old question: What happens when a can't-miss subject gets missed?__This engaging documentary about Jewish-American comedians pays homage to the Borscht Belt masters of disrespect who brought their tumultuous, irreverent clowning into the American mainstream during the early days of network television.__For a disorganized film that has trouble deciding what it's about, "When Comedy Went to School" can be a lot of fun.__Superficial and hokey yet still oddly endearing ...__Ron Frank and Melvut Akkaya's documentary suffers from an approach by turns scattershot and schmaltzy.__The archival footage is rich. The interviews - with Jerry Lewis, Sid Caesar, Jackie Mason, Mort Sahl, Jerry Stiller and others - are saucy and spirited, and the history is terrific.__It's the squarest of square love letters, and it plays like one of those bland, slick History Channel specials.__Fortunately for the filmmakers, most of the comedians interviewed here - Jerry Stiller, Jackie Mason, Jerry Lewis and many other (mostly male) voices - provide lighthearted remembrances to elevate this poorly executed documentary.__[A] charming but skin-deep documentary ...__What's missing is the onstage archival footage that would show us why this humor mattered in the first place-there are only a handful of five-second snippets.__By no means a great documentary, but it's a very entertaining one, mostly because of the entertainers it spotlights - the generations who passed through the Catskills, learned their craft and went on to create modern American humor.__This enchanting documentary on the rise, fall, and small-scale rebirth of the Catskills has something of a fairy tale quality.__None__None__None__None
Seyfried, with her huge features crowding her small face, looks like Alice in a very strange Wonderland. But whatever possibilities she may have as an actress are eradicated by the filmmakers ...__Linda's feelings are rarely revealed: that's left to the gloomy final act, which feels more like a guilt-inducing postscript than a genuine reveal.__"Lovelace" becomes too distracted by industry politics and the cultural context of the film's release to provide more than a snapshot of her life either before or after she stepped in front of a camera.__Lovelace bids to whip up hot indignation about an outrage four decades old. Instead, it provokes dismay.__Unfortunately, most of Lovelace is more generic and familiar, right down to the too-neat happy ending.__This drama from codirectors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman is so respectful of 70s porn sensation Linda Lovelace that instead of humanizing the Deep Throat star, it reduces her to one dimension: victim.__Directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman settle for a titillating, exploitative snapshot instead of a fully rounded portrait.__The familiar arc is complete, the grisly elements all ring true. But somehow it all feels too surface, too easy. Why, why, why? There must have been more.__It has a pair of terrific performances at its center, and an intriguing story.__Lovelace" is a well-made but grim film.__There's a lot in this story about victimization and agency that Mr. Epstein and Mr. Friedman never satisfactorily address.__Co-directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman never quite pull it off - although you can see how they might have.__A timid gloss on a hardcore subject.__Epstein and Friedman opt for the most broadly entertaining and salacious details about the 1972 porn film, giving short shrift to Lovelace's complicated contradictions.__The superficial script doesn't go nearly deep enough to begin explaining Lovelace.__This movie is short on nuance, but at least it treats Lovelace with a respect she didn't often find in her difficult life.__Ultimately, the movie relies as heavily as any porn feature on its intrepid female lead. Rather than exploiting Seyfried, however, Lovelace just sort of wastes her.__Its maudlin third act mars what is, for much of the film, a pretty nuanced and well-acted biopic, as well as something of a cultural critique.__Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman spin two versions of the story of the ingenue who starred in the most successful porn film of all time.__With the exception of good-natured porn vet Harry Reems (Adam Brody), everyone here is out to tear a piece off Linda Lovelace, whoever she was: Messrs. Epstein and Friedman don't really get to what made her tick, although one can guess.
Modest in scale, expansive in emotions, this movie is a rarity: a contemporary tragicomedy.__Despite its ultimate sense of optimism, the Glasgow-set dramedy nevertheless carries a sense of foreboding. And yet, that might not have been the intention.__The result is a sometimes gritty, occasionally charming Highland hybrid, but the final balance feels slightly off-kilter.__Loach takes us through the mysteries of whisky making, exploring the subtle tastes and scents in ways that will have audiences wishing they had a dram at hand. But a glass also serves more symbolic purposes ...__If you want to look for it, you'll find a layer of metaphor (the distilling process as a symbol of the characters' evolution) and social-realist commentary amid the gentle, life-affirming laughs.__[Ken Loach] and his longtime screenwriter, Paul Laverty, find a good balance between drama and wacky character moments.__A fairy tale with its feet firmly on the ground.__A lark, but it's a serious-minded lark, addressing issues of class and culture, the haves and have-nots.__Charming enough to satisfy even the trenchant-commentary crowd.__The plot thickens, but the mood grows lighter.__Unexpectedly, and blithely, amusing.__The film itself vaporizes before your eyes, but it's likable. Given its unstable mishmash of thuggery and whimsy, that's something of an achievement.__Like the spirit it celebrates, "The Angel's Share" is a neat little jolt of pleasure - and guaranteed to leave you feeling just a mite warmer.__While a few farcical moments fizzle, it's mostly charming.__"The Angels' Share" leaves a warm glow.__[Mr. Loach] has gone and directed a comedy from a script by his longtime collaborator Paul Laverty, and it's so delightful that his fans will be clamoring for more.__Watching it is like receiving a hard slap in the face from someone who expects you to laugh it off, even though the sting lingers.__Graphically observant about the ease with which young men starved of opportunities can turn their energies inward to destroying themselves and one another.__While there's no ignoring the social ills that haunt Robbie's hopes, the movie's optimism serves as a cheeky, and surprisingly inspiring, retort.__Just how is one supposed to react, in 2013, to a non-ironic use of the Proclaimers' "(I'm Gonna Be) 500 Miles" in a musical montage?
The film's quartet of post-slackers are captured as they feel their way around the edges of what they want (and are afraid to ask for) with painful accuracy.__Here's a toast to the cast and crew: "Drinking Buddies" is a three-dimensional movie that doesn't require beer goggles.__[Swanberg] points the movie in directions that defy our expectations, exploring the characters' immaturity and the entropy of human interaction.__Not much happens in Drinking Buddies, which, frankly, is refreshing.__"Drinking Buddies" sneaks up on you; you think it's going in one direction, and suddenly it goes somewhere much more interesting.__Swanberg doesn't exactly reinvent the romantic-comedy formula, but he explores it in unexpected ways, with a terrific cast making the relationships all the more genuine and enjoyable.__A meandering, unfocused kind-of love story among 20 and 30-somethings that grates as much as it pleases.__The movie has a keen eye for the ways in which we sometimes resign ourselves to less-than-satisfying lives.__Swanberg achieves an occasionally heady aura of improvisational flirtatiousness mixed with a churning will-they-or-won't-they suspense.__Drinking Buddies walks a fine line between the mundane and the meaningful, but the actors walking it are top-notch.__This is a special movie.__Director Joe Swanberg and a terrific ensemble cast imbue a simple story with authenticity and shambling charm.__Drinking Buddies  is a crackling screwball comedy refracted through a low-key, mumblecore prism.__There's more plot, and scripted dialogue, here than in Swanberg's earlier, mumblecore work. But authenticity still comes first.__Mr. Swanberg's camera weaves through bodies at rest, at work and at the bar in no particular hurry, and his script captures the idioms of men and women who are equally inclined to waste words and to say very little.__It feels mumblecore-ishly vague and rambling in its construction, like Hannah Takes the Stairs without the raffish charm.__"Drinking Buddies" has a cleaner structure than Swanberg's earlier wanderings, but after several projects I still don't know what compels him as a filmmaker ...__We laugh with these people not because they're absurd, but because they're so normal. Swanberg's made the rare film that feels exactly the way your friends do when they don't know you're watching them.__The entire film unfolds in a recognizable register of ominous hesitation; the results are a bit schematic but nevertheless hit on something real.__The actors all blend terrifically, making this the film equivalent of great hang time.
He was certainly combative, and confident, and full of love for the city he governed with such gusto. Koch is a New York story for the whole world to appreciate.__What he really was was one of a kind. Whether intentionally or not, "Koch" shows that that's not necessarily a bad thing.__An emphasis on Koch the character obscures his administration.__Though the film, more than two years in the making, was never intended as such, it plays like the kind of eulogy Koch would have approved - neither fawning nor eviscerating but always compelling.__The film advances no theories to explain his contradictions, only a thrilling, sometimes affecting account of what he did.__"How'm I doin'?" Koch famously asked anyone and everyone he passed by, rarely hanging around for the answer. In "Koch," for the most part, he does all right.__"Koch" is a treasure trove of little moments that illuminate a famously cantankerous, sharp-elbowed, showboating personality.__A highlight-to-lowlight chronicle of the man's three terms as mayor, and in the case of any other mayor, such a narrow focus might have seemed reductive.__I wish other questions had been asked, and pushed, and a lot more context provided.__Koch presents an uncommonly juicy subject for a documentary, and filmmaker Neil Barsky makes the most of the opportunity.__If the film were even two minutes longer, it might constitute Koch overload. Luckily, Barsky knows when enough is enough, even if his subject doesn't.__It's hard to fault a documentary for being as slanted toward a subject as director Neil Barsky's "Koch" is when the movie chronicles as self-celebratory a figure as former Mayor Ed Koch.__New York may be a safer, cleaner and less argumentative place than it was in the 1980s, but he remains as contentious, as mischievous and at times as inflammatory as ever.__Koch doesn't try to do anything radical as a piece of filmmaking, but Barsky -- a former newspaper reporter -- covers Koch's story magnificently as a journalist.__If unlikely to change anyone's mind about its subject, it's an effective primer on a voluble and charismatic mayor who embodied the spirit of the city he loved.__Neither blind idolatry nor a definitive portrait; just a major missed opportunity content to loiter in the middle of the road.__The film is a canny balancing act, making Koch's arrogance so plain that you quickly move past it and concede that he accomplished remarkable things for a city that was broke and in chaos and with much of its housing stock in ruins.__None__None__None
A high-concept comedy that peddles some slapstick laughs and life lessons but little insight.__This is froth, but it's good froth.__Rather than a jolting shot of joe, this French-Canadian comedy is a soothing cup of warm cocoa.__"Starbuck" is essentially a situation comedy, but what a situation.__Never mind high concept, this is high conception.__"Starbuck" is one of those high-concept yet formulaic, sitcom-like comedies that gets by on charm and speed.__It's silly and a bit sappy, but it works, in a crowd-pleasing way.__Director Ken Scott, who also cowrote the script with Martin Petit, has fashioned a story that starts out low-key and gradually builds in its emotional expansiveness.__The film seems aware when it's being shameless ... and its goodhearted generosity is utterly endearing.__[Starbuck] would be more likable if it were less ingratiating. It didn't have to be so quick to excuse the hero's general, genial incompetence just because he's so doggone lovable and has such studly sperm.__Director Ken Scott stresses the movie's dude-centric outlook, playing up the anxieties of impending fatherhood, and neglects any sort of maternal perspective, which dumbs down an already moronic premise.__Bertrand does his jelly-belly best to keep "Starbuck" a comedy. But even the broadest shtick can't prevent a movie that features a Busby Berkeley-style group hug from becoming a male weepie.__The Citizen Kane of sperm-donor comedies.__Geniality and mild laughs aren't enough to sustain interest in this predictable effort, especially given the dragged-out running time.__As amiable art-house fluff, it's a passable way to kill time before the Vince Vaughn American remake later this year.__"Starbuck" is up to its eyeballs in mush. You may want to regurgitate.__"Starbuck" is more than the sum of its calculations, though not a whole lot more.__A high-concept goof that's hard-pressed to surmount its twee preposterousness.__What could have been one long, smutty joke ends up turning into a moving slice of midlife.__An ostensibly feel-good French-Canadian comedy about artificial insemination gone awry, Ken Scott's Starbuck mainly makes you feel like taking a shower.
"Happy People" seems to strain toward the notion that harsh nature makes for a pure heart. And perhaps it does for some. But all?__Titling a documentary about snowbound Siberian fur trappers "Happy People" is not as ironic as it seems.__Herzog's longing for the ideological purity in which these lives are lived, free of paperwork and bureaucracy, taxes and technology, drives the film, which lacks an overall story arc.__It's a do-it-yourself world that Herzog clearly admires - much of what we see is the men performing the tasks that enable them to survive.__They decidedly don't seem happy. And "Happy People's" decision to skate down the frozen Yenisei without examining their unhappiness more closely leaves a slight chill.__If you want a taste of life as it must have been for the Voyageurs of old, this documentary is a good place to start.__Albeit a found film of sorts, Happy People is very much of a piece with Herzog's other work, examining man's place in the natural world, looking at man's history and man's ability to survive, to endure.__Herzog has become a master of the understatement - knowing just how long the images can sustain you without a word being said.__Herzog is not insincere. His passion for outsize experience has always captured our essential human identity against big backdrops. He captures it again in "Happy People," but this time with a twist.__The film has a relaxed, matter-of-fact feel.__It's Herzog's inventive use of voice-over that elevates the film above an extremely well-researched episode of Nature.__We should be grateful to Herzog for bringing us this remarkable footage, but the real subject of "Happy People" may be his yearning for an imaginary paradise he can't have.__The film is both elegiac and amazingly retro, like the nature specials that baby boomers were weaned on - although it's not for animal lovers, unless you have a specific grudge against sables.__Mr. Herzog is openly inspired, as ever, by the rugged independence of these resourceful trappers, who seem stoic about everything but their faithful dogs.__What Herzog gleans from Yaskyuov's exhaustive material is a simple observation: The men of the Taiga are heroes of rugged individualism.__An inspired 94-minute rumination on the hardships and liberties of a remote culture.__There is indeed much beauty on display, from the icy Taiga landscape to the age-old trapping techniques passed on through generations.__Vasyukov and Herzog are united in their fascination with the particulars of how to thrive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth.__[It's] all interesting and quite Nanook-ish, and the summertime mosquito assault can haunt your dreams. But don't expect the payloads of cosmic irony and mystery Herzog has had occasion to find wherever he goes.__It's fitting that this film of people making do with what they have should itself look somewhat humble, without lyricism, a work not of beauty but of work-which is the thing that makes it beautiful, no matter who directed it.
Diana might have been flawed and scheming and love-starved, but this film doesn't help explain that. Nor does it illuminate the common touch and humanitarian side that endeared her to a global audience.__Not a lot different from whatever movie Katherine Heigl has made lately.__The film can't find the woman beneath the facade, despite Watts' best efforts. Maybe she didn't exist. Or maybe there's a better movie to be made.__It's ... a pity that her life is reduced to such a forgettable movie.__This visually polished, Oscar-baiting docudrama chronicles her final two years, and even in death she's a subject of invasive speculation.__If you are going to make a film about the late Princess of Wales, you are obviously going to choose the guy who directed "Downfall," about the last days of Hitler, and the actress who played opposite King Kong.__Diana" is one big missed opportunity__Sixteen years after her death, Princess Diana is still capable of generating interest, which is probably the only reason why this dull, pointless movie was greenlighted.__Tries to humanize its leading lady, but it only embarrasses her (and us) in the process. Diana deserves so much more than this.__Carries with it the whiff of Harlequin, the mouldy and tired air of a cottage paperback left on the dock.__The movie may not be great, but for some it will be a fine guilty pleasure.__This is a TV movie all the way, in the pre-HBO network shlock sense of the term.__Like most people, Diana Spencer was a lot of people - but "Diana" can only see the romantic naif.__Despite the lackluster romance and the peculiarities of the casting, the subject of Diana's last years is so inherently compelling that the movie maintains interest throughout.__[Hirschbiegel] nicely conveys an intimate restlessness, only to blow the mood with ominous tidings.__While "Diana" is hardly a fully effective film, it admirably tries to understand a lonely public figure made briefly, energetically whole through a nourished intimacy.__Lacks any insight into the characters involved, and surely would have the late Princess of Wales rolling in her grave.__There's a germ of a smart biopic in Diana; the problem is that it's tucked away behind a clunky structure and even clunkier dialogue.__One wants to say "too soon," but 150 years would be too soon for Oliver Hirschbiegel's close-to-comedic treatment of the princess' last chance at happiness.__"Diana" isn't just an egregious case of rewriting history, but one of oversimplifying it.
With its soap-operatic performances, bonkbuster plotline and sparkling seafront setting, all 'Adore' really lacks is a cameo from Alf Stewart__Would Fontaine have made this film if the mothers looked like and were as old as Barbra Streisand and Kathy Bates and the sons weren't built like surfers? Of course not.__This isn't an Oedipus complex. This is a Preposterous complex.__Cast actresses with the skills that Naomi Watts and Robin Wright bring, give their obliviously icky story some arthouse visual lyricism, and you've got "Adore."__Adore is, as my late mother would say in describing Sidney Sheldon novels, good trash.__An exceedingly silly, sun-baked sex movie, the kind of import that adds just enough brains to its genitals to get into U.S. arthouses. (In the '70s, the mothers would have been played by Laura Antonelli and Sylvia Kristel.)__What's shocking here is how not shocking all this is. Watts and Wright provide interesting portraits of two friends who really do appear to have an unconditional fondness for each other. They make the unfathomable believable -- almost.__At Sundance, where the first showing was nearly laughed off the screen, Adore, based on a Doris Lessing novella, was known as Two Mothers. You should know it as something to avoid.__Adore wants it both ways. It asks not to be judged by standards of realism, but then tries to inject realism and naturalism into its absurdist narrative.__Astonishingly, Wright and Watts sell their characters - the yearning, the bond, the inevitable wrong ahead. But "Adore" remains too much of a stretch.__I have no idea why such strapping young men would be so desperate for sex as to hook up with a couple of museum artifacts they've known all their lives, but this hokey soap views contrivance as a small price to pay for lush mommy fantasy.__Outre love stories are great, as are love stories that make viewers squirm. But they have to ring true emotionally, and despite its talented cast, Adore does not.__Watts and Wright movingly convey their characters' journeys: caught up in new, reckless love; frightened by the passage of years; determined to hide within an envelope of stolen time and a fantasy that can't last.__It's even hard to simply enjoy the performances of the two stars, who give more that the film deserves.__"Adore" at its core is a bore, nothing more.__Ms. Wright and Ms. Watts address their roles with skill and conviction, but this has the effect of making the story seem even more fanciful and absurd.__This story of two dynamite Australian moms falling in love with each other's surfer-god sons is sensuous and gorgeous but also strained and opaque.__There's an undeniable "ick" factor to this film that overwhelms the justifiable cougar angle. Even worse is the boredom that soon sets in.__The film has an impressive pedigree -- screenplay by Christopher Hampton, from a novel by Nobel laureate Doris Lessing -- but still feels like something of a bodice-ripper, if people bothered to wear that much clothing.__That the mothers are played by Robin Wright and Naomi Watts is really the only thing that makes the movie something more than an unintentional comedy.
Jon Van Dyke's "Not Today" doesn't qualify as a good movie, but it's built on an admirable foundation of good intentions.__Writer-director Jon Van Dyke offers rugged production values, and his real agenda - getting Christian viewers to help end sex trafficking - mires the movie in self-conscious angst and speeches.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Linsanity offers lots for b-ball fans, but also has a higher purpose.__At age 25, the likable and surprisingly humble Lin has so little career behind him and, his fans hope, so much more ahead, that his onscreen soul searching about lost opportunities and early missed dreams rings hollow.__A little game footage can go a long way; and a lot of game footage, no matter how good, goes a very long way.__As a piece of filmmaking, Linsanity is scattershot and too reliant on newsreels. And the interviews, most of all with the religiously devout Lin are, alas, fairly unrevealing.__Leong's film isn't particularly stylish, but it makes the most of the climactic Knicks footage, as well as showcasing a sweetly goofy side of the 25-year-old ...__You may have watched Lin's rise to national prominence the first time, but it's still easy to get caught up in the moment.__Lin raised his game's possibilities; you just wish that Mr. Leong had raised his.__A plethora of Lin family home-video clips, riveting archival and Leong-shot footage ... help tell the icon's remarkable story.__Banal and fawning, with Lin coming off as a pious, charmless subject.__Linsanity doesn't -- and shouldn't -- hide its star's religious beliefs. But the doc should have the courage to explore them.__[Its] strong but wholly appropriate Christian overtones may alienate some fans, but this is rousing fare ...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Do the Kabbalist readings or wild free associations that Room 237 celebrates improve The Shining? Let's say that they create a parallel text: Lost in the Overlook, in search of the overlooked.__A curious and entertaining documentary.__The human brain is a marvellously suggestible organ.__[A] strange, frustrating, occasionally fascinating doc ...__"Room 237" evolves from an ode to movie love at its most delirious to a wry examination of the crackpot mind at work.__There's enough real evidence supporting the theory that Kubrick was a genius, and that's pretty entertaining all by itself.__It's about the human need for stuff to make sense - especially overpowering emotional experiences - and the tendency for some people to take that sense-making to extremes.__The results can range from enlightening - Kubrick did like to mess with things - to embarrassing. But it's never dull. "Room 237" shines.__You don't have to buy any of the nutty theories in Room 237 to appreciate what director Rodney Ascher has accomplished.__It's nuts, in the best possible way.__Their imaginings are not far removed from the deconstuctionist gobbledygook that has hammerlocked academic film and literary scholarship. But here at least the gobbledygook is entertaining.__[It] may be the surpassingly eccentric-and enormously entertaining-film that Kubrick deserves.__"Room 237" is an act of uncommon devotion to cinema, embracing the notion that movies are best defined by what happens to us as we watch them - how our own beliefs and experiences dictate our interpretation of what we've seen and heard.__This is sure to amuse you if you get a bang out of the claims that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and Dark Side of the Moon was intended as a soundtrack for The Wizard of Oz.__I found most of what's actually put forth in the film interpretively ridiculous. But I'm just one theorist among millions, and the film worked for me anyway.__Listening to fanatics go on and on about their fixations can be kind of fun. For a while, at least.__As amusing as the movie is, I think in the end that Ascher misses the labyrinth for the trees.__The theories proposed in the doc "Room 237" aren't eye-opening. They're laughable.__A beautifully edited, deeply strange compendium of what different people have read into a single film.__A thrilling testament to the fact that art is - and should be - open to interpretation.
Mystery lovers will delight in the sophisticated murder scheme, oenophiles will love the Wine Expo atmosphere, and admirers of restrained menace will lose themselves in the icy pools of Arestrup's eyes.__How much you enjoy "You Will Be My Son" depends on how much you can take an unbearable, arrogant jerk as your lead character.__Gilles Legrand's draggy melodrama about miserable characters who persist in their folly and never wise up is strictly vin ordinaire.__French director and co-writer Gilles Legrand shows great mastery of tone and pacing in his third feature, which begins life as a domestic drama set at a family-owned vineyard and slowly morphs into a tense thriller.__A strongly acted, character-driven melodrama, concerned with the dynamics of family in general and father-son issues in particular, it presents situations so emotionally supercharged that the whole story could have come straight out of Balzac.__It's an entertaining melodrama of the old school that plays out with the clockwork inevitability of a "Columbo" episode.__The parallel dramas underline the universal theme of primal jealousy, as fathers confront the prospect of their sons superseding them.__You Will Be My Son endlessly spins its wheels, offering up scene after scene of Deutsch screwing up, or just plain existing, and Arestrup tossing deeply disgusted glances in his direction.__A kind of parable that is as much an effective portrait of intergenerational struggle as it is a slick psychological thriller with Shakespearian shadings.__Evoking a contemporary fable but unfolding like a thriller, You Will Be My Son is most of all a devastatingly realistic depiction of the festering resentments shared between a father and son.__Great talent and a monstrous ego often come as a package deal, as illustrated by this insightful, taut 2011 drama set in Bordeaux.__Legrand has directed with belief in what he is doing, and Niels Arestrup as Paul manages to be both strong and subtly humorous.__Niels Arestrup delivers an award-caliber turn as a malevolent patriarch in this gripping melodrama.__A classy, full-bodied family drama from Gallic scribe-helmer Gilles Legrand.__None__None__None__None__None__None
What Berger does with the actors, the sight gags, the close-ups, the music, the photography is close to perfection.__This year's crowded field of Snow White movies has a winner, at least in terms of quality, in Pablo Berger's delightful Blancanieves.__Berger, like his rad forebear Luis Bunuel, marries poetry to film.__While the story, shorn of its supernatural elements, is mired in abuse and tragedy, its effect is sensual and superficial.__We're not in Disney's world. Berger knows his Grimm, and he suffuses his entrancing fairy tale with a moving sense of melancholy.__From Spain, here's a miracle of fairy tale repurposing: a version of the Brothers Grimm's "Snow White," set in Spanish bullfighting country in the late 1920s. Writer-director Pablo Berger's Blancanieves goes all the way with its concept, and then further.__Alfonso de Vilallonga's music isn't mere accompaniment, it's a score with rich emotional resonance. The silents, as this film suggests, achieved aesthetic marvels before sound came along to set things back for a while.__Had Berger gone deeper into Rafita's sad passion he might have passed beyond the safe frontiers of Disney and into the twisted realm of Bunuel.__If you're looking for visual kicks, this offers plenty.__The running time is a bit indulgent, but the journey is delightful.__The Brothers Grimm would have been surprised, possibly amused.__A sensual and sophisticated retelling of a beloved fairytale re-imagined as a homage to European silent cinema, Spanish writer-director Pablo Berger's black-and-white Blancanieves will leave you transfixed.__Most films are experiences to be ignored or at best forgotten. "Blancanieves" is a little classic to be treasured.__It is a full-bodied silent film of the sort that might have been made by the greatest directors of the 1920s, if such details as the kinky sadomasochism of this film's evil stepmother could have been slipped past the censors.__Blancanieves, which won 10 Goyas (Spain's equivalent of the Oscars) and was a smash hit in its native Spain, has traces of a kinky undertone and an uncommon willingness to embrace the darkness inherent in this fairy tale.__As if bewitched, the legend of Snow White is transferred to Seville in the early twentieth century and transformed into high melodrama.__Sensuous, mischievous, hotblooded retelling of the old Teutonic fairy tale.__This gorgeous silent film is an unexpected gift from the gods of pure cinema.__The purest, boldest re-imagining of silent cinema yet.__It creates something new out of something old. And it does it by treating a treasured children's story with the grown-up respect it deserves, and retelling it with a smile - but never a wink.
The crucial central roles go wanting.__It is skillfully made and adeptly performed; even so it doesn't really add anything to the canon.__This Great Expectations is an absorbing addition to the roster of Dickens films that continues our 21st-century fascination with the worlds created by a 19th-century storyteller.__Director Mike Newell approaches the sprawling bildungsroman with a stiff formalism, sacrificing all cinematic excitement for the sake of exalting great performances.__Honors the source while making some small but significant alterations.__It's not clear what this re-do adds except another line to these actors' resumes.__An honorable, sober but completely unnecessary take on the Dickens novel, "Great Expectations" serves as a fine introduction to the story but won't excite those familiar with previous versions.__It's a welcome and faithful addition to the canon, despite some tweaks.__This swift, gorgeous, uneven production captures the scope, flavor and drive, if not the depth, of Dickens' greatest novel.__It's good, not great - but, for some of us, expectations will be met, and then some.__For all its lapses, the portrait of a Darwinian social order of haves and have-nots resonates with the chilly, jittery times in which we live.__For those who prefer their classic literary adaptations to be as pure as possible, Great Expectations will be a happy addition to the canon.__Yet another big-screen version of Dickens' exquisite tale of striving, charity and arrogance highlights the Gothic deliciousness of the tale.__Does this iteration have anything new, fresh, or innovative to recommend it? Nope.__This remake is the victim of its own loyalty, forgetting that the confounding of expectation is what brought the story to life in the first place.__If your own expectations are not too high, you crave period-costume drama and you're one of those unfortunate people who refuses to watch anything in glorious black-and-white, this Great Expectations is worth the time and effort.__One can't help but feel Dickens's classic text has been bent and broken-and not necessarily into a better shape.__Lazy English teachers who park their students in front of this will be doing those kids a service.__The chief reason to watch Newell's film is for the impeccable acting.__A passable feature-length adaptation that does little to burnish the estimable screen legacy of a Dickens classic.
Remarkably, The Summit achieves some of the same dizzying impact as Gravity -- by philosophical and psychological means, rather than special effects.__The subject is fascinating and the cinematic punch afforded by peaks so massive, inspiring with their terrible beauty is a filmmaker's dream.__You have a tangled story being told by director Nick Ryan and writer Mark Monroe in a somewhat tangled way. The result isn't as much confusing as it is distracting.__First-time director Nick Ryan isn't entirely up to the challenge in "The Summit," but he does deliver some dramatic and visual highs in the attempt.__At once repetitive and puzzling. There is a lot of finger-pointing. Assertions are made, theories offered, but not much in the way of certainty.__There's something unsettling about a real-life tragedy presented as an action film; that the filmmakers never acknowledge this is more unsettling yet.__It's frustrating not to know exactly what occurred when, how and to whom. Of course, some of this is due to the fact that nobody really knows everything that happened, except, as someone notes, the mountain itself.__"The Summit" is an impressive achievement, but there's a good reason to ask whether cameras are turning the planet into a playground for the reckless rich: because it's there.__Ryan's film is visually stunning and viscerally powerful but nearly incoherent in its packaging of information.__A film that feels curiously hollow.__Nick Ryan's documentary The Summit pieces together the fateful expedition utilizing newsreel footage, new and old interviews with the climbers and their associates, and, regrettably, re-enactments.__I'm afraid it will only leave some audience members with the same nagging question I had at the beginning. Why on earth do people do this?__At once visually impressive and narratively unfocused.__A complex and gut-clenching human drama that has the great advantage of all being true.__A pulse-pounding success.__Director Nick Ryan mixes in re-creations and actual footage to tell of an ill-fated climb involving an international group of established mountaineers.__Director Nick Ryan dramatizes this horrific tale through a variety of hindsight interviews from survivors and the dead's loved ones, footage shot by the climbers during their mission, and staged recreations ...__As you watch these actors, you appreciate the endeavor the climbers went through all the more-and as triumph turns to tragedy, you feel the grief winding its way through your shaken nervous systems.__It's a noble effort, but by wading into the murky waters of who acted heroically, and who, perhaps, did not, Ryan loses touch with the mountain itself ...__A gripping, cliffhanger document of a deadly trek up the most dangerous mountain on earth where 11 climbers lost their lives.
Making only his second film outside of his native Iran, Kiarostami undercuts the rigid protocols of polite Japanese society with intimations of violence.__Kiarostami's apparent simplicity masks serious complexity.__Kiarostami is masterful in his layering of space, using glass walls, mirrors, and, in one instance, the aligned side windows of parked cars to suggest a world of divisions, both between people and within them.__Maybe it all serves a purpose, but a movie about empty people doesn't necessarily have to feel empty itself.__A Rorschach test of our own responses to the intimate drama unfolding before us.__The latest small, perplexing masterpiece from the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami, who in recent years has chosen the path of a world director.__"Like Someone in Love" is not a complicated story, but in Kiarostami's telling, it is a rich one, and a rewarding one, too.__I came away from it as if I had spent an evening contemplating a handsome abstract canvas. I can't explain it to you, exactly, but I found it soothing.__There are some limited rewards in seeing the consequences and complexities that result from the characters' deceptions and assumed roles, but in the end the film is unsatisfying.__Like Someone in Love is directed imaginatively, is impressively acted, and is quite disappointing -- not even successful in its own way.__Impeccably acted, infused with tremendous empathy for its three leads, and yet not without stretches of deliberate tedium...__There is love, the movie tells us, then there is love.__Masterful filmmaking bridges a few gaps in the narrative.__Like Someone in Love has rather simple, sentimental, melodramatic underpinnings, but the vantage changes everything. It opens up this world - and the next. It's an enthralling journey.__Like Someone in Love is a movie that never quite lets you through to the other side of the glass, but it's dazzling to watch whatever drifts by on the surface.__Despite its visual felicities, Like Someone in Love is so free-floating that it floats away.__The film deepens a style Kiarostami has been refining for years. Characters ride in the backs of cars, sealed off from the city and yet constantly moving. Reflections in windows and mirrors both bring characters together and keep them apart.__Kiarostami embarks on a typically indirect but never rambling path in "Like Someone in Love," crafting an elegant mystery that resonates beyond its final, jolting moment.__Every shot - everything you see, and everything you don't - imparts a disturbing and thrilling sense of discovery.__Like Someone in Love boasts gently insightful moments, but sometimes Kiarostami just seems like a wide-eyed tourist in unbuttoned Tokyo, the anti-Tehran.
Hunger in America is not about a shortage of food but an abundance of poverty. This is where the spiral spins downward.__A shocking indictment of how people are starving in the land of plenty ...__You don't have to be a fan of info-graphics in social-justice docs to be troubled by one showing that the price of processed food has decreased in almost exact proportion to the rise in cost of fresh fruits and vegetables.__"A Place at the Table" presents a shameful truth that should leave viewers dismayed and angry: This nation has more than enough food for all its people, yet millions of them are hungry.__One thing is clear from "A Place at the Table": You cannot answer the question "Why are people hungry?," without also asking "Why are people poor?"__It specifically addresses our country's hunger crisis. But it also speaks to larger hungers. Hungers for independence, a dignified life, a better chance for ones children-in short, the American dream. See it and weep.__As rich as we are as a nation - still - many of our citizens are, at best, malnourished. One in six says they regularly don't have enough to eat.__It deserves to be seen, along with "Food, Inc.," "King Corn" and other muckraking food docs of recent years.__A Place at the Table is advocacy journalism at its best, lining up its facts, illustrating the widespread problem with a few trenchant and compelling cases, and offering solutions.__The filmmakers vividly illustrate the power and depth of the long-spiraling problem of "food insecurity" by immersing us in the hardscrabble lives of a cross section of our nation's poor.__Revealing little that a moderately informed viewer will not already know, the film shies away from the outrage and bare-knuckle journalism that this shameful topic deserves.__In addition to the dismaying facts and figures is a fuller sense of what hunger can look like, and feel like, among the millions of Americans classified as "food-insecure" ...__So many of the words spoken in Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush's moving documentary about hunger in the U.S., "A Place at the Table," will haunt you long after the film is over.__A well-reported and devastating look at hunger in rural America.__As important and eye-opening a documentary as you'll see this year, "A Place at the Table" makes it impossible to think of hunger as merely another symptom of a shredded social safety net.__A tighter focus, or even just a voiceover narration, might have helped.__Their stories are wrenching and provide a functional framework for the directors to make some important points about hunger in America.__A graceless info-dump bracketed by interviews with activists and a handful of personal stories from suffering families around the country.__A good documentary that is good for you.__Through their stories, Jacobson and Silverbush lens a broader picture of rampant hunger in a country that actually produces astounding amounts of food.
With a title like Haute Cuisine, one can expect a high degree of gastronomic titillation. On that score, the film delivers.__"Haute Cuisine" has no grand conflict or important message or really anything much that you'll remember past dinnertime, but it has abundant charm and it leaves you hungry, which is all we ask of a food movie.__Haute Cuisine is an epicurean dream where the dishes conjured up by the characters are as essential to the experience as the characters themselves.__A pleasant dramedy inspired by a true story.__"Haute Cuisine" is a bonbon, not of a full-course meal.__If you love France and food, separately or in combination, you will almost certainly forgive Christian Vincent's workmanlike direction, the tedious score, and the near-total absence of dramatic conflict.__Ms. Frot brings a sympathetic mix of determination and passion to Hortense, who dedicates herself to making dishes that suit the president.__A reserved, tres simple tale that raises the occasional smile and tummy rumble but keeps hiccuping because of the drawn-out parallel story about her subsequent tour of duty.__Narrowness of focus keeps the movie from becoming bloated with self-importance, but it also leaves it feeling a little inconsequential-more of a pleasing snack than a satisfying meal.__When a movie's high-stakes moment is whether a cream cheese should be considered dessert, it's hard not to motion for the check.__If the material lacks a distinctive flavor profile, its restraint is its strength. The focus on a woman's passionate hard work without need of marital-status back story is refreshing.__Those with a yen for food porn (especially truffle fetishists) will feast. All others may want to order something else off the menu.__Writer-director Christian Vincent and co-writer Etienne Comar, aided by Frot's quiet intensity, imbue Hortense's quest to pull off culinary miracles with an urgency that's almost absurdly compelling, and all the more entertaining for it.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
An offbeat, sometimes self-congratulatory road movie romance.__They embark on one of those maundering, life-lessony odysseys that filmmakers love but audiences rarely do.__One of those many indies that exist to give actors a chance to go slumming.__Well-acted but ultimately unmemorable ...__The film equivalent of a dysfunctional computer sloppily assembled from discarded parts of other machines.__The promise it begins with doesn't pay off. And while "Arthur Newman" is not a complete disaster, it does leave you wishing the romance and the ride had been a whole lot smoother.__How can two performers as charming as Colin Firth and Emily Blunt make a movie with so little charm?__It's almost its own genre in indie films: Boring middle-aged man tired of his existence meets up with free-spirited but troubled younger woman. Romance and newfound meaning ensue.__Arthur Newman fails to finesse an essential problem: how to make a boring man interesting.__"He was kind of boring," Kevin says to Mina about his dad. "I mean, the lectures." And boring he remains.__For the most part, the film is very basic, a simple drama about the dangers of avoiding responsibility, but there are occasional flairs of eccentricity.__The script of "Arthur Newman," written two decades ago by Becky Johnston, cries out for deadpan anonymity, not the charismatic likes of these two.__Director Dante Ariola and writer Becky Johnston have such a strong idea at the core of Arthur Newman that it's all the more frustrating when they follow it down the most familiar path.__The resolution for both characters, in a finale that turns disappointingly conventional, is so sad that it left me depressed beyond hope.__You'll soon wish the film were about someone a bit more exciting ...__Fun for a bit, things soon turns silly ...__None__None__None__None
One of the most intriguing and thoughtful American films of the year.__Its absurdist tact won't be for everybody, but there is satisfaction in the nuanced, often-pleasing performances from Rudd and Hirsch as they slowly reveal their characters to both the audience and each other. These two grow on you.__It's an intimate two-hander with lots of dialogue, humour and poignant revelations, set against a backdrop of rugged woodland beauty.__[A] gently existentialist buddy movie.__The performances and ghostly, melancholic atmosphere make it satisfying twist on the male buddy film.__David Gordon Green somehow brings together the poetic sensibility of his independent art movies and the humorous lowbrow non sequiturs of his studio comedies; the results are one of a kind and often weirdly moving.__It's an actors' showcase. But Green films it with real feeling and an eye for parts of the Lone Star State that, as we can see, are no longer.__"Prince Avalanche" is a molehill that dreams it's a mountain when it's really, really stoned.__Mr. Green has managed to turn a story about two road workers doing road work into something compelling.__Prince Avalanche is a remake of an Icelandic movie (Either Way), but it's pure David Gordon Green, from its absurdist humor to its quiet, haunted landscapes. (David Wingo's delicate score enhances both the wit and the wonder.)__The movie barely seems to hold together. Could it even be called a movie? And yet, it's captivating - a bit like Gus Van Sant's Gerry, but not as conceptually hidebound.__Rudd, in particular, gives it everything he's got, but he is vanquished by a story that feels both inconsequential and contrived.__An uneasy mix of Richard Linklater and Abbott and Costello, "Prince Avalanche" is an oddment, but one that brings some small, peculiar pleasures.__The film ultimately plays like an unfinished thought. It's a good thought, mind you, but like the road, it seems to go nowhere.__If Laurel and Hardy, wearing matching baggy overalls and similarly dumbstruck expressions, had starred in a screen version of Waiting for Godot, the results wouldn't be far afield from Prince Avalanche.__Worth seeing for its offbeat character study.__"Prince Avalanche" is a work of eccentric but often profound beauty. That old Green magic, it seems, is back.__The movie feels like there wasn't a script. Like Green just handed Rudd and Hirsche two pairs of overalls, a few bottles of grain alcohol and set the cameras rolling as they bromanced it out over a weekend in the woods.__Mr. Green is too fond of these guys, and too respectful of the little bit of freedom they possess, to ensnare them in the machinery of a plot.__This is ultimately an acting showcase gone awry, and you wind up feeling as agitated and bored as the main characters.
Jamie and Crystal Fairy, though slightly exaggerated for comic effect, are still truer representations of gringo backpackers than I've ever seen on film.__[Cera] has transformed himself from one of the most irritating actors of his generation to one of the best.__Consistently funny and fascinating.__While the pleasures of Silva's trippy road-trip movie are mostly minor, it still does something major by eliciting Cera's boldest performance to date.__Shot on the fly, while Silva, Cera & Co. were waiting to make another movie, Crystal Fairy ends up on a beach, and ends up resonating with a pesky charm.__Part drug comedy, part psychological drama, the movie is slight, but only superficially so.__The clash of cultures is harrowing and sometimes hilarious.__"Crystal Fairy" isn't going to be the mind-expanding movie buzz that blows your mind, but in its laconic, trippy way it gets under the skin.__The movie is a little Mobius strip of laughter and pain.__Writer and director Sebastian Silva based his film on his own experiences but allows his actors so much space and time that you feel as if you could be watching home movies.__Director Sebastian Silva seems to be whispering that we shouldn't be taken in by the movie's casual, spontaneous feel, that deep matters are afoot. I'm not sold.__Silva based the story on a personal experience from his early 20s, which he realizes with vivid detail and wry, humane observation; the humor is sweet and lingers in the memory.__A film that's funny, touching and startlingly unique.__Based on a true story, using improvised dialogue and a handheld camera, "Crystal Fairy" feels authentic.__A perplexing movie that does certain things so well you can mostly forgive it for the things it doesn't. Mostly.__The ending sneaks up on you with a surprising bit of emotional catharsis, thanks largely to a brave, complex performance from former child star Gaby Hoffmann.__Scenic, short and slight, the film manages to avoid the tendency to make these sort of big-screen excursions more tedious than actual road trips.__We already knew that jerks aren't necessarily interesting. Nor is watching footage of other people doing drugs.__[This] trippy comic odyssey may not be for everyone. But Crystal Fairy gives off fumes that deliver a indisputable high.__[A] small, lovely road movie ...
"No Place on Earth" is at its most moving when showing us, in close-up, the still-haunted faces of the cave dwellers, many of whom tell their stories to director Janet Tobias' camera.__[A] fascinating but frustrating documentary ...__The film is not without its flaws, but the story it tells is both terrifying and inspiring.__After nine years of research, Nicola unearthed an amazing chapter in WWII history.__The producer's hand is heavy in No Place on Earth, but it ultimately can't sink the inspiring tale of endurance.__The movie is engaging but appallingly superficial when it considers the larger history of the Holocaust.__The story told by Janet Tobias' documentary "No Place on Earth" is enough to transcend the film's limitations.__Add one more extraordinary survival tale to the canon of Holocaust documentaries: "No Place on Earth."__"No Place on Earth" depends heavily on re-enactments, but Tobias handles them delicately and keeps a lid on any overemoting.__A substantial contribution to Holocaust cinema.__The film mixes emotional accounts by proud survivors from two families with foreign-language re-enactments that are perhaps too faithfully murky.__The film is built from moving, frank interviews with survivors from two families who hid, speaking over and around extensive re-enactments.__No Place On Earth mixes present-day interviews with re-enactments that illustrate the speakers' words without adding much to them.__This story is both uplifting and awe-inspiring. It deserves to be told better.__Unfortunately, the telling, by director Janet Tobias, is no match for the story.__None__None__None__None__None
It's a touching film and a fascinating glimpse into one of those couples you can't quite believe are still together.__A painful, powerful portrait of the struggle and sacrifice required to create, and the cost that it can demand.__The story of an extraordinary marriage between two people bound together by their artistic impulse.__A lively double portrait of Ushio and Noriko Shinohara, two Brooklyn-based artists who, after 40 years of marriage, are still creating side by side, and tormenting each other.__More than anything, the film expresses - at an almost subconscious level - the difficulties of discerning not only what real art is, but also what true love is all about.__Intriguing as their present lives may be, without enough background to appreciate, for instance, Ushio's associations with Rauschenberg and Warhol, we can't gauge the full extent of the couple's regrets and losses.__"Cutie and the Boxer" takes this tale of two artists and tells it with style and wit ...__Heinzerling captures candid, touching moments that illustrate the awe-inspiring power of love and acceptance.__Their 40-year marriage seems like more of a trial than this overweening, lightly likable movie acknowledges.__Directed with invention and insight by Zachary Heinzerling ...__Slyly comments on the ironies of the past half century in contemporary art.__Movies twice as long are often half as eloquent.__The film neither simplifies the troubled relationship nor pushes us to take sides, but asks us to observe the complexities of their life together.__All that footage has been organized into a compact, graceful story arc.__A movie that makes you feel less like a spectator than a guest, a friend welcomed into the home of an odd and fascinating couple.__Working as director and cinematographer, Heinzerling earned the couple's trust before turning his camera on their days and nights. But once that camera was running, there was no blinking, no turning away.__Viewed in its entirety, "Cutie and the Boxer" is more than a great documentary. It's a great film.__They express love and vivaciousness, at once seeming like any couple walking down the street and yet unlike anyone you're lucky enough to spend time with.__"Cutie and the Boxer" is one of the most unsentimental and unstinting portraits of marriage ever brought to the screen ...__Though Noriko describes their relationship as being like "two flowers in one pot," with only enough room for one of them to blossom as an artist, the truth seems to be sadder, less romantic, and more relatable.
A film bloated by excess material.__The effort to pack an already overstuffed picaresque epic into a film of more than two hours ends up an indigestible stew.__The film is beautifully shot, with vivid production design. But because of the tale's lack of cohesion, it doesn't carry enough emotional heft.__Faithfully adapted from Salman Rushdie's award-winning 1981 novel, the movie feels both too packed and too slight, overflowing with vivid details but lacking the structure to support their weight.__There are enough intermittent passages of power and beauty to get you through the slow spots.__A pretty but staidly linear epic drained of the novel's larkish, metaphorical sweep, and a collection of multi-generational love stories lacking their originally eccentric, fizzy charm.__Mehta has given us something as pale as it is panoramic.__Rushdie's characteristic antic humor animates the family scenes, but the movie gets bogged down in endless plot convolutions and whimsy (the material would have worked better as a TV miniseries).__In its steady great-books way, the film is often truthful and moving.__A movie that, if never exactly dull, feels drained of the mythic juice that powers the book, which won the Booker Prize in 1981.__The cinematography is memorably vibrant, and the performances are solid, even if they pass by too swiftly. Most of all, of course, the subject matter remains fascinating.__Midnight's Children has the paradoxical misfortune of being both too rushed and too wearingly long.__So lavish and unwieldy is the book, Rushdie's best, that a film of it can't help but feel like a helpless reduction, like a bucket of water passed off as an ocean.__It's a vibrant journey, but not a terribly illuminating one.__The film is ambitious and often sumptuous to watch but not always dramatically satisfying.__Mehta fudges the political allegory in favour of the story's magical realism, but still can't get her arms around the material - or past Rushdie's own bear-hug.__Watchable without ever feeling essential.__Deepa Mehta has crafted an epic, visually pleasing tale weaving politics, colourful splendour, romantic love and magic with her most ambitious film to date ...__None__None
It's neatly formatted, but if there's a message in the margins of this manuscript, "Populaire" doesn't spell it out.__As romantic comedy it's uneven, but as an ode to something long gone, "Populaire" hits the right notes.__Even when there's tragedy around the turn, it doesn't matter. Populaire plays like a musical - you expect anyone, at any time, to break into song.__[Populaire] does run through the expected paces with admirable style, with a glossy, Technicolor production design that sometimes makes it seem it might have been made in the '50s, not just set there.__Roinsard, who wrote his feature debut with Daniel Presley and Romain Compingt, is unabashedly in love with cheesy, cornball sentiment, which he dusts off and polishes to a fair-thee-well.__Is this remake really necessary? Maybe not, but to worry about that is to risk missing out on a lot of fun.__Roinsard labors mightily to eke laughs and excitement out of '50s secretaries in Technicolor dresses, towering heels, and awkward hairdos hammering away at keyboards, with limited success.__[A] sweet but slight homage to the 50s and 60s.__"Populaire" is catnip for a certain breed of twee Francophile.__A genial, knowing throwback-a reminder of that stylish, half-imaginary era that thrived in Hollywood before Mad Men came along and pickled it in gin.__The fabulous retro look and joie de vivre of this French lark are so infectious, it's easy to forgive its fatal flaw: Watching someone type is just not that interesting.__"Populaire" tells the kind of transcendentally silly fairy tale that has long been a French cinematic specialty.__While Populaire would still have suffered from being overlong and overfamiliar, a smoother leading man could have done much to boost the intended Cary Grant vibe.__The less seriously the genial French comedy "Populaire" takes itself, the more amusing it is. Fortunately, with small exceptions, this film doesn't take itself very seriously at all.__When things change to a rom-com template, things get slightly more rote, but in everything from film stock to (slightly overactive) score, "Populaire" is a nice shift to another time.__Only those unversed in frothy, Weinstein-approved confections will wonder where Populaire is headed.__That clack-clack-clacking sound you hear is the pressing of the keys by the millions of screenwriters who've come up with similar high-concept comedy templates.__Roinsard's feature-length debut is visually sharp, with period design that's eye-catching without being fussy or fetishistic. Too bad there's not much going on beneath the surface.__A colorful and impeccably styled romantic comedy that manages to turn the speed-typing competitions of the 1950s into entertaining cinematic fodder.__Regis Roinsard's impressive debut is a love letter to 50s filmmaking, but one that lacks a real heart.
Watching Jenkins and O'Hara go at it (in more ways than one) is especially terrific fun.__The tone is irresolute, as if Zicherman, a self-proclaimed A.C.O.D., hadn't fully resolved his feelings before spinning them into this lumpy comedic drama.__Promising premise goes nowhere.__The film is too broad to be discerning, but there are a few laughs here and there, thanks to a solid comedic ensemble.__"A.C.O.D." may leave a slightly sour aftertaste. As a look at the state of modern monogamy - or at least our enduring if misguided faith in it - it's refreshingly acerbic.__Not only is the movie just so-so, but the parts themselves aren't much.__The movie's messy, predictable, occasionally sitcom-shallow, but it's blessed with a cast of pro farceurs-including Amy Poehler and Jane Lynch-who put a spin on almost everything they do.__A syndrome that may provide food for thought but not a lot of laughs.__There's an undertone of score-settling to this not-so-romantic comedy, a bitterness that's sometimes unpleasant and sometimes wickedly funny.__A.C.O.D. is reasonably pleasant and therapeutic and antiseptic and you just wish somebody would bring a chandelier down on somebody else at some point.__[A] pointless, meaningless and witless comedy ...__Mr. Zicherman needs a better crew, some time with the Criterion Collection and a fresher story, one perhaps not plucked from his own life.__Even with Adam Scott, Richard Jenkins, Catherine O'Hara, Jane Lynch and Amy Poehler on board, the results are regrettably forgettable.__A spotty comedy with a great cast and a catchy title that falls apart in the final third.__Any movie starring these justly adored actors is likely to have its share of highlights and both are, indeed, delightful to watch.__It's too broad to qualify as incisive, too mild to rise above the level of amusing.__This is the sort of movie you watch on a long flight because you like at least one of the cast members, and you laugh a few times, and then you forget that you ever saw it.__Too sluggish for farce and too glib for a trenchant social satire, A.C.O.D. is several sessions short of a breakthrough.__Zicherman should have trusted his dark instincts; he did too much micromanaging of his own.__A solid debut for Zicherman, and a worthy vehicle for Scott and company.
The story doesn't hold together, but Hahn and Temple are terrific.__The results are a little life lesson-y but well-observed.__The entire film is good but the revelation here is Hahn, reliably one of the funniest women in Hollywood, now suddenly given a rich, complex and even sexy role.__It's refreshing to hear dialogue that's natural and modern and doesn't try to pontificate. And the rewards are many.__"Afternoon Delight" puts the typical suburban mother's lifestyle under an uncomfortably honest microscope, then documents the sporadically funny and occasionally sad results.__Funny and trenchant, it isn't a shapely farce. It's a comedy of confusion that dares to be unlikable -- and somehow, that makes it more lovable.__A couple's marriage is edging toward collapse when they try to reboot their dormant sex life in this sly, hip, and rewarding comedy of manners.__[Soloway] excels at drawing out nuances in female friendship. Here, though, she promises an uncomfortable expose of middle-class morality, then doesn't follow through.__It's an up-and-down movie, honest one minute and a fraud the next, but you stick with it mainly because of Hahn.__The moral of the story appears to be: Don't invite a stripper to come live with you in your home. Suggestion noted.__As the sweetly amoral tattooed-goddess-for-hire, Temple does her wiliest acting yet.__The rubber-faced Hahn is a gifted comic actress and a surprisingly effective dramatic one, while Temple's monotonic twitter keeps the girl a tantalizing enigma.__This could very well be a movie we look back on in a decade to note the copious amounts burgeoning talent held within, just waiting to break through the surface.__There are some bright one-liners in the beginning, but the comedy/drama mix is an uneasy one, especially considering the shabby way the film treats McKenna, as a tart who's just there to improve some yuppie sex lives.__Whether or not you wince, this meticulously acted movie, which won Ms. Soloway a directing award at the Sundance Film Festival, paints an accurate picture of how a segment of youngish, educated, affluent, white Americans converse.__"Afternoon Delight" defaults to a calculated, upbeat ending that has little organic connection to the story, but it's a crisp and often hilarious female-centric social satire loaded with delicious talent from the TV-comedy pool.__[An] erratic blend of not-quite satire and halfhearted soul searching.__These are very much first-world problems, and the portrayal of Temple's happy hooker is a tad disingenuous. Nevertheless, the fleshed-out performances keep it sympathetic.__There weren't many promising paths for Soloway's high-concept premise to take.__The central conceit is impossibly contrived.
Somm also provides the sort of general interest that comes from watching anyone involved in an endeavor that requires dedication, discipline and a touch of craziness.__Engaging doc isn't just for wine nerds.__"Somm," an inside look at wine stewards, attempts to unveil the secrecy of the master sommelier exam, and though the results aren't always vintage, there is some pleasant tasting to be had here.__By the end, despite the surface-y quality of the treatment, you're caught up in the suspense, the horse-race aspect of a very particular pursuit of knowledge and excellence.__[It's] a Herculean feat that all but requires advanced degrees in wine theory, history, geography, service and, most crucially, tasting, all of which director Jason Wise examines in crisp, quaffable if overlong fashion.__"Somm" does a fairly impressive job of making wine tasting somewhat cinematic despite its being essentially unfilmable, at least until taste-o-vision comes along.__We've seen these guys torture themselves so much, we inevitably get emotionally involved in the final verdict, and drinking to their success is what we'd all like to do.__"Somm," though an entree into a little-known world, rarely finds a second dimension.__The whole thing is much more fun than you'd imagine watching people drink would be, and by the end, you're surprisingly invested in which of the guys, if any, will pass the final test.__Somm caters well to foodies and to anyone who'd like to see a sommelier do more than point to the menu and pop the cork.__Though wrenching moments are effectively delivered, the film teeters into clunker territory, with repetitive tasting scenes and cheesy shots of exploding glasses of vino.__The subjects are arrogant, anal retentive, and self-regarding, yet for some reason Wise wants us to identify with them.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Definitely a great stunt, but you spend the film thinking how much more the "Jackass"/"Bad Grandpa" crew could have done with a premise like this.__It feels much like a theme park itself -- really exciting at first, but then your senses are dulled, and eventually you just want to go.__Suggests an R-rated Twilight Zone episode with a twist of Fellini-lite, in a trite film school kind of way.__It's really just a middling fantasy about a middle-aged dad having a meltdown during a family vacation to the Magic Kingdom, with a few scattered sci-fi and horror elements thrown in.__The effects-heavy movie flies off into exotic yet inconsequential science-fiction visions; Moore's view of the macabre in the banal is a tepid successor to David Lynch's.__[A] creepy, inventive, nearly successful little movie ...__A borderline-experimental miasma of sexual neuroses, macho angst, regressive frenzy, and fevered paranoia.__"Escape From Tomorrow" delights in randomness, stumbling down one rabbit hole after another. Nothing really builds, from one scene to the next; it's like doing a Sudoku puzzle in disappearing ink.__Is this satire or parasitism?__Writer-director Randy Moore channels everything from "The Shining" to David Lynch's "Eraserhead" to depict a family's gradual disintegration in what is supposed to be the happiest place on Earth.__None of it is as scary or as funny as it should be, and what starts out as a sly thumb in the eye of corporate power ends up as a muddled and amateurish homage to David Lynch.__Are the fantasies of a dirty middle-age man, drooling over underage girls in short shorts and grown women dressed as cartoon characters, really something to aspire to?__As a movie, "Escape From Tomorrow" is at best pretty good, but the way it was made makes it something unique, possibly memorable.__Aside from the outlaw aspects of the filming, it's never quite as interesting as you want it to be. But who knew that the Happiest Place on Earth could be so convincingly cast as a shadowy fever dream?__A cult classic in the making, if I've ever seen one.__Escape From Tomorrow soon turns into an endless loop of Expressionist symbolism, scoring its blunt points over and over until at last it limps off the screen, trailing suggestions of a reboot with altered players.__Moore's sometimes surreal, sometimes sophomoric, black comic phantasmagoria, makes for a bumpy theme park ride.__Moore shows promising ingenuity in shooting parts of the movie covertly, within the notoriously restrictive Disney World resort. But his script never takes the same sort of risk.__Basically, the whole thing can be summed up as an epic midlife crisis.__"Escape from Tomorrow" is a much better idea than movie.
So much taste and intelligence went into these finely wrought costumes, props and sets in order to tell a story of such tedium.__Though the tale, based on a novel by Harold Frederic, remains relevant to our time, the film is too self-conscious and tedious for the message it delivers.__If every war has more than one side, this story of one man who dares to stand against the tide of history has a contemporary relevance that remains uncontested.__Sluggish drama ... defines this morality lesson about the unimpeachable virtue of loving thy neighbor.__Less like a peering examination of the turbulent political environment than a reenactment of a Ken Burns documentary-or a museum tour.__Aside from the PBS-re-enactment music, the film's primary problem is that it lacks a clear central plot.__The story offers uncommon insights on the endlessly parsed period in history, but its execution sometimes falls short.__"Copperhead" crams far too much of its action into its last 30 minutes after a rambling, drawn-out set up.__The earnest but dry Civil War drama is for history buffs only.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This thorough, engrossing film shows how idealistic Aussie hacker Julian Assange took on the might of the US, exposing their military and diplomatic misconduct, then allowed his own murky personal life to tarnish his credibility.__Sometimes it takes a feature-length documentary to stitch together a story we think we already know.__A psychological suspense film with an open ending that's more haunting than the tricky climaxes of most post-Hitchcock thrillers.__A real-life cyber-thriller with real-life consequences, Alex Gibney's We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks is a riveting and revelatory documentary ...__Gibney builds a remarkable level of suspense, given how exhaustively WikiLeaks has been covered in the media.__Engaging, kinetic, revelatory and unexpected.__At once an awkward mingling of two complex life stories and a gripping, necessary look at how information is gathered, shared and, yes, stolen.__Who is "We" in the title We Steal Secrets? There's no need for a spoiler alert, but it's neither Gibney nor Assange.__Despite its wonky-Washington theme, We Steal Secrets ends up being a surprisingly soulful and, yes, even moving story of hubris, good intentions and mistakes.__The sequence in which Manning confides in former hacker Adrian Lamo and gets turned in to the FBI supplies the kind of human drama that has made Gibney's work so engrossing in the past.__The movie's especially deft at exposing spin, whether it's the US media's or Assange's.__The results are far more exciting than most Hollywood espionage thrillers.__Alex Gibney's latest, "We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks," is very good -- manage to do both.__Unlike many other non-fiction filmmakers, Gibney is not interested in scoring easy points. He has a point of view, but he also wants to be fair.__How do you make this a motion picture? Some might call it sleight-of-hand, but it's something Mr. Gibney has proved himself adept at time and time again ...__A sprawling, ambitious, major work -- a gripping exploration of power, personality, technology and the crushing weight that can come to bear on those who find themselves in its combined path.__For all its faults, "We Steal Secrets" reminds us that despite the potential of WikiLeaks, its project of truth and consequences remains treacherous and complicated in practice.__Even the movie's title, or rather the source of it, is a surprise.__Future historians will find the ideal chronicle of our era in the superbly crafted "We Steal Secrets."__Those looking for a summary of the WikiLeaks phenomenon-from the big leaks to the major shifts in public perception about Assange and his cause-won't find a more cleanly delineated version.
"On the Job" is a sturdy and sophisticated crime drama from the Philippines that takes a pretty gruesome situation and enriches its presentation with lots of human detail.__Matti uses this setup to show the rot in Philippine society, and it's often compelling stuff - filmed mostly on dirty streets and in moldy, ramshackle buildings.__Even at its most incomprehensible, the propulsive thriller "On the Job" is never less than arresting.__Makes up in character development and action shots what it lacks in narrative innovation.__Despite the relative flatness of [the] characters - their relationships to one another are more archetypal than particular - the film is as heartbreaking as it is heart-stopping.__The film manages to create some moments of genuine nervous tension, but is undercut by its split storytelling.__Combining street-level crime with political corruption, On the Job owes as much to Scorsese as it does to Philippine current events.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
After a while it's hard to take Dosunmu's barrage of off-center compositions ... dialogue sequences that have the actor converse with empty space, and close-ups that reduce faces and objects to blobs of light.__It takes about 60 seconds before the elegant "Mother of George" has you firmly inside the world it has created.__Serious cinema of the globalist sort.__In the end, "George" becomes almost as irritating as that mother-in-law.__It's a powerfully sensual movie, gorgeously lensed colors and textures conveying its characters emotional states while thoughtfully exploring the range of human sexuality through Adenike's experience.__The whole cast is good, but the film wouldn't work without a great performance from Gurira, who is of Zimbabwean descent.__[A] lushly detailed and passionately performed melodrama ...__Gurira acts with fire and pride and, at times, a despair bordering on instability.__The cinematography by Bradford Young is rich-toned and lustrous, and the film, until it bogs down in melodramatics, has a sensual ease. We are not looking at these people from the outside. Dosunmu pulls us deep inside.__The movie's an eyeful, and the filmmakers' attention to surface texture results in passages of genuine eroticism.__An unexpected gem about true love, infertility and a meddling mother-in-law.__Darci Picoult's script renders all of these characters, if not always sympathetically, humanly and fully.__The imagery in Mr. Dosunmu's film is consistently surprising and lush. Even the straight-ahead portraits of his characters, used as emotional caesuras, are rich in colors and textures. But he's a storyteller, too ...__Director Andrew Dosunmu's film is big-hearted and rich, frequently using slow motion to underscore an artful intimacy.__Human beings are mysterious and surprising. There is something irresistible about a movie that reaches that conclusion.__We want to get as close as possible to these characters, but for all its admirable elements, the film that frames them keeps us frustratingly aloof.__This is one of the most striking entries in the 2013 global wave of black cinema, but also admittedly one that poses hurdles to audiences with conventional expectations.__The actors are both superb, conveying suppressed feeling through falters in their perpetual poker faces.__Working from a script by playwright Darci Picoult, Dosunmu fashions a tale that's realistic, melodramatic and culturally specific, yet unmistakably archetypal.__Simply relating the narrative of Andrew Dosunmu's seductive immigrant drama Mother of George would do little to convey the film's stark, poetic power, much less its extraordinary visual and sonic acumen.
A wealth of information is sufficiently articulated, though the film's greatest strength is Ambo's compassion toward the subjects.__Davidson's compilation of seemingly immeasurable data is interesting, as is the doctor himself.__If you focus on its fascinating subject matter and the dramatic revelations presented here with irrefutable impact, "Free the Mind" qualifies as a pioneering inquiry at the outermost boundaries of neuroscience.__Danish director Phie Ambo's documentary only scratches the surface of a complex subject.__By the end of this documentary, you'll feel like a kid again, filled with wonder and questions about humanity and yourself.__"There's something healing about simply watching "Free the Mind" ...__Larger ideas of a mind-body connection, and mentions of brain research, are not treated in an inspiring or deeply informative way.__Devotees may enjoy seeing their practice in (proverbial) action, but the veterans' therapy is too short and qualitatively evaluated to convince skeptics or would-be recruits.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Director-co-writer Sheldon Candis stretches a lot of the time, a romantic story seems to have been cut drastically, and the film's climax is far too typical.__Even the boarded-up row houses look romantic.__A sometimes taut and occasionally preposterous day in the life of an 11-year-old accompanying his uncle on business in Baltimore.__What begins as a promising peek into the tragic cycle of waylaid promise that's crippling broken inner-city families is itself dispiritingly pulled sideways in the Baltimore-set indie "LUV."__Both for good and for ill, "LUV" has a film-school feeling about it, and channels a legacy of fatalistic American crime cinema that includes "Mean Streets" and "Treasure of the Sierra Madre."__Saved from its predictable plotline by a strong cast and a central relationship written and performed with sensitivity, LUV reveals the stakes of trusting in a role model and the costs when that person turns out to be human.__"LUV" may not convince with Woody's aggressively telescoped transformation. But the actors compensate.__It does not entirely succeed, but at its best "Luv" shows the kind of heart and intelligence that is always welcome - and often missing - in American movies.__The first half of the movie is painfully tense, drawing us into a relationship that we desperately want to see work. But the screenplay lets its characters down, as it devolves into platitudes and melodrama.__his contains plenty of incidental pleasures, including some vibrant images of contemporary Baltimore and fun character turns from Charles S. Dutton, Danny Glover, and Dennis Haysbert.__The rapper and actor Common has become a highly skilled screen star, but this touchy-feely dud does him wrong.__Luv is split right down the middle between preposterousness and truth, and between amateurishness and confidence.__Here is a film about African Americans that sidesteps all the usual, hopeful cliches and comments on how one failed generation raises another.__A kind of "Training Day" hoping for interstitial Terrence Malick poetry in the Baltimore landscape of "The Wire" with the occasional sensationalism of an action film.__Although Common and Rainey make a well-matched duo, their chemistry is frequently squandered by a script (co-written by director Sheldon Candis and Justin Wilson) that boxes them into impossible roles in one cliched scene after another.__With its rock-skimming male bonding alternating between grisly homicides and a florid Mexican standoff that begets a tidy take-the-money-and-run finale, this tale seems less timely than merely tall.__Candis generally displays solid skills, and clearly works well with actors.__Heartfelt and formulaic in equal measure.__None__None
This masterwork is set in contemporary China, where the gulf between those able to maneuver (or manipulate) the country's economies of change and those left behind or defeated by the seismic shifts widens.__In two decades of moviemaking, China's Jia Zhangke has examined the damage of his country's explosive growth with a poetic sense of outrage. With his latest effort, the implied violence bubbles over.__Jia is passionate about his characters, but that never compromises his considerable artistic control.__Drawing on four news stories, writer-director Jia Zhangke portrays the plight of workers in the new China. Set in four provinces, A Touch of Sin is humanist critique of the country's turn to capitalism.__Jia offers a stark presentation (no music, few edits) that discourages vicarious thrills; the violence is startling, not cool.__Jia's primary concern here is the solitary suffering of his characters, punished to the point where they can't take anymore.__Epic and intimate, A Touch of Sin finally feels as big and complex, as contradictory and sad as, well, China.__Fists are raised, pistols are cocked and knives are brandished in Jia Zhangke's dystopian and throbbing take on modern China.__In addressing the two-pronged beast of westernization / corruption, Jia gives us a multipronged and engrossing set of plots.__In Jia's methodically furious vision, the ambient violence of unchecked power erupts among the insulted and injured with a horrific yet liberating sense of destruction and self-destruction.__A corrosive depiction of the New China, an everything-for-sale society still figuring out how to cope with the dehumanizing effects of unbridled capitalism.__Sin, more stylized than the director's previous work, is also more detached.__The most dramatic and even lurid of writer-director Jia Zhangke's movies.__"A Touch of Sin" is by no means subtle, but it is composed with a passion and sinuous grace that makes it far more effective than many other sincere message movies.__A blistering fictionalized tale straight out of China, "A Touch of Sin" is at once monumental and human scale.__The movie builds repeatedly to crescendo, pushing some desperate individual to the brink and then watching as he or she explodes into violence.__Jia has a knack for orchestrating violence: The brutality is just stylized enough to have a kick, though you always feel its emotional weight.__By far the best action movie of the year.__A bitter, brutal, often brilliant exploration of violence and corruption in contemporary China.__It's travelogue cinema for the dissolute and gravely disenfranchised.
The film offers all manner of mind-blowing tricks, as well as a colorful history of the evolution of magic and illusions, especially through the 20th century.__Jay's own personality and intellect steer the film, and he's such a finely honed performer that he easily carries it off...What we get here, simply, is time spent with Ricky Jay, and that's time well spent.__Molly Bernstein and Alan Edelstein's film works first and foremost as a showcase of Jay's skills, but he's also an ideal interview subject ...__A documentary portrait of the magician, author and actor who is known as one of today's preeminent practitioners of close-up magic.__For heaven's sake! Another documentary I didn't know I was waiting for-and am equally glad to see.__The magic in this documentary portrait of actor and stage illusionist Ricky Jay comes mainly from his fond recollections of old performers.__The larger subjects, eloquently evoked, are the sources of his knowledge and inspiration, and the singular tradition within which he works and flourishes.__Fittingly, there's a lot to try to keep track of in "Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay."__The stories are amusing, but the film tells us hardly anything about who Jay is offstage. We get a guided tour of his passion, but never encounter the man himself.__It reveals the philosophy behind Jay's art, a view of life that examines illusions from every which way, and finds meaning in the magic.__This documentary provides an elegant, enthralling peek behind the curtain and into the you-won't-trust-your-eyes world of this celebrated contemporary conjurer.__"Deceptive Practice" lets us peer up close at what he's doing - camera tight on the cards, Jay's sleeves pushed up - and we still don't know how he does it; for lack of a better phrase, it's like magic.__Aside from some references to misdirection, Jay offers no clue as to how he pulls off illusions with sleight of hand, but he performs them with such panache that you have little choice but to suspend disbelief.__To be able to find, nurture and share one's passion with such unceasing enthusiasm is surely the essence of magic itself.__In Deceptive Practices, the entertainer pays his mentors and inspirations the ultimate tribute by turning a film ostensibly about himself into one fundamentally about all of them.__He always holds a card you don't see.__It's magic, pure and simple.__Well structured and dynamically edited, Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay relies on the famed magician himself to wax autobiographical with his usual charm, humor and panache.__Unsurprisingly, Mr. Jay proves a hugely entertaining guide, and as generous about his professional inspirations as he is reticent about his own life.__A lot of the charm of this straight-ahead documentary comes from Jay simply holding forth on old (in many cases, centuries-old) illusionists and their work.
It requires a leap of faith, but this handsome-looking film offers a disarming combination of insight, compassion and provocation.__Directed by Atiq Rahimi and based on his novel, "The Patience Stone" speaks for all oppressed women, for all oppressed people for that matter.__With a piercing edge, "The Patience Stone" is a cry from behind the veil, where a suffocating woman weaves a new life of her own design.__The bare room where the husband lies helpless becomes a confessional where Farahani pours out the woman's life story in a performance that grabs you with its quiet yet searing power.__A startling fantasy of Muslim feminist empowerment that allows the Iranian-born actress Golshifteh Farahani to put on what amounts to a one-woman show.__Some movies prove both immediately transformative - altering how we view the world as soon as we leave the theater - and long-lasting, demanding days or weeks of reflection.__[A] quietly fierce condemnation of fundamentalist Muslim society's treatment of women ...__The film burns with the collective anger of exiles, unfolding as an indictment of the Islamic customs and religious practices that oppress women in their native countries.__Most impressive, however, is Farahani's lead performance. Though often pitiable, the heroine never registers as a martyr or a victim, but a relatable, multifaceted human being.__It's a little on-the-nose. But "The Patience Stone" has Farahani, in nearly every shot, and in its meticulously paced way her movie-long confessional is something to see.__From beginning to end, it's a very human story.__Amid these horrors, the young wife retains not only the frailty but also the incandescence, the sheer staying power, of beauty.__It's a tragedy streaked with nightmare farce.__"The Patience Stone" is essentially a monologue, and Atiq Rahimi (directing the adaptation of his own novel) doesn't have what it takes to make the story more dynamic.__Speaking truth to power - all manner of truths, to any kind of power - is at the core of "The Patience Stone."__Life and death circle each other restlessly and then furiously in the Afghan-set movie "The Patience Stone."__Shines a startling, hugely affecting light on the desperate measures so many women must take to survive in the world's most mercilessly patriarchal cultures.__There's only so much anyone can do with a conceit that amounts to a movie-length speech delivered to a coma patient.__The camera observes, quietly. There is a stillness, not only in the images, but in the air itself.__Farhani ... almost single-handedly carries the film; the range the Iranian actor displays here proves that she's destined for bigger things. Fans will just have to be patient.
A misbegotten project, as well as a missed opportunity.__Not only provides illuminating insights into racial and cultural issues, but explores family dynamics common to all.__By the end you can't help but wonder whether it was a good idea to keep the youngsters under camera scrutiny for more than 12 years.__The fact that the pair pulls off the nearly 21 / 2-hour run time without making the audience tire of the subjects is a feat itself.__I'm glad I saw this movie because it allowed me to spend time with two engaging boys whose young lives are worth chronicling. But those lives can't bear the symbolic weight the filmmakers place on them. Nor should they have to.__A remarkable documentary, though only partially for the reason its creators intended.__It's a baggy movie, with some things (such as whether Idris taking Ritalin in high school improved his performance) unexplained, and it may appeal most to those raising kids themselves.__By the time Idris and Seun are preadolescents, they're struggling, and so are the filmmakers.__Ultimately, American Promise seems split between a personal perspective and a broader one. It's a bold experiment that's also a textbook case of filmmakers being too close to their material.__An intimate look at what it's like to be young, black and male in a largely white private school.__A moving document of what it means to be a minority in an exclusive, high-performing school.__While Stephenson and Brewster's big-picture attempt to tackle a sociopolitical issue from the most personal of perspectives lacks the state-of-the-nation impact of [Hoop Dreams], it doesn't mean you won't feel the pleasure of these kids' triumphs.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Photojournalist Shaul Schwarz's powerful documentary Narco Cultura gets inside the world of two men who, in very different ways, inhabit this horror.__This issue-based journalism piece yields diminishing returns the deeper it digs.__An eye-opening examination of Mexico's blood-soaked drug war and its unsettling pop-culture side effects, Narco Cultura is as overwhelming as it is absorbing.__This haunting documentary contrasts songs saluting Mexican drug lords as heroic bandits with the harrowing reality of life in murder-stained Juarez.__This dispassionate but devastating film looks at the drug wars from two very different but chillingly complementary perspectives.__After watching "Narco Cultura," it's hard to imagine any "recreational" user of pot wondering whether the joint he or she just smoked isn't soaked in human blood.__"Narco Cultura" aims to tell the story of what's happened in Juarez and in Mexico (and, by virtue of its immense appetite for drugs, the U.S.). Instead, it feels more like a couple of intriguing chapters.__"Narco Cultura" shows us two nations locked in an expensive and destructive war whose only winners are the politicians, police chiefs and drug lords, and whose losers lie in marble tombs and paupers' graves all over Mexico.__There is nothing here that hasn't been more thoroughly documented in other studies of the drug-related crime that grips Juarez.__"I think we can be the next hip hop," boasts a narcocorrido impresario, who's surely kidding himself.__South of the border, the constant terror of bloody battles over drugs and territory has influenced music, movies and a level of star worship. But the glimpses we get here are a bit listless.__Narco Cultura shows in fascinating detail how these merciless killers who have taken over the city have become Robin Hood-style folk heroes.__Both an unflinching record of Mexico's drug war and an investigation of how violence becomes unreal and glamorized.__A potent encapsulation of how fame and finance beget fear and grief.__Ping-ponging between grisly South of the Border carnage and Angeleno musician Edgar Quintero's growing success as one of the subgenre's stars, you start to see how this parasitic relationship works.__The breadth of director Shaul Schwarz's documentary Narco Cultura is staggering.__None__None__None__None
I stopped taking notes when the woman disintegrated into a ball of writhing snakes.__Despite its astronomical body count, John Dies at the End never takes itself too seriously, and neither should you.__Director Don Coscarelli isn't especially smooth or coherent, and he leans on weird for weird's sake.__How can a single movie contain all this awesome craziness?__[It] eventually finds its own rhythm and meaningful chaos.__Nobody cares about John.__Salvador Dali meets George Romero. Say hello.__As with most fantasy films, the story is secondary to inventive images and speculative ideas. And more than most, this one adheres to its own logic in ways that are continually entertaining.__"John Dies at the End" dies closer to the beginning, before writer-director Don Coscarelli's adaptation of the book of the same name has reached minute 20.__What Coscarelli's achieved doesn't feel like an adaptation. It feels more like he seems he skimmed the source material, burned it, and then assembled a vague recollection on film after three days of untold indulgences.__"John Dies at the End" thinks it's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" for dudes. But in its randomness, its vulgarity and its level of humor, it's more like the collected writings on the walls of a roadside men's room.__It zigs, zags and trips over its own feet and on its own home-brewed hallucinogens. It's a ridiculous, preposterous, sometimes maddening experience, but also kind of a blast.__A movie so brazenly off-kilter that I'm not entirely sure its title is even accurate.__The "wackiness" (scare quotes included) is mostly ceaseless and tiresome, from the ravenous zombie neo-Nazi that leads things off to the Galaxy Quest rejects that figure in the movie's annoyingly anticlimactic finale.__It's the ultimate in spoiler titles. And this stoner Ghostbusters, an altered state disguised as a movie, may also add up to a hot cult item if silliness doesn't sabotage the scares__What may be the most freewheeling and imaginative film of Coscarelli's checkered career, loaded with tripped-out mood and nicely balanced between humor, horror and an underlay of genuine sweetness.__John lives in a frisky otherworld of willful incoherence all its own.__John Dies at the End is joyously heterodox in its method, an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink melange of sci-fi, black comedy, and action, with disquieting body-horror sight gags that at times recall David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch.__A shaggy-dog story with restless leg syndrome.__When you're having great fun at a movie and suddenly you're not, where's the fun?
Brian Epstein needed someone to run the nascent Official Beatles Fan Club. Freda, just 17, got the job.__In this charming insider account, Kelly traces her history with the band from the very early days until after their split.__[A] delightful documentary ...__While the tales of the band's spectacular rise create a genial mood, the film feels superficial.__[Gives] insight into a rare, innocent time in rock history when a scrap of pillowcase that cradled a mop-top singer or an autographed photo were all fans needed to feel close to their idols.__Although this music documentary has some historic value, it aims to entertain -- and succeeds, largely because its subject is a natural on camera.__[A] warmhearted documentary portrait ...__For any hard-core Beatles fan, this is essential stuff - and for anyone who follows pop culture, it's rather bittersweet.__The sweet-faced Kelly is a lovely and humble storyteller, and her enduring affection for John, Paul, George and "Richie" is palpable.__We love her, yeah, yeah, yeah.__A generic jaunt down memory lane ...__Don't look for scoops on Yoko or the band's breakup, but it's hard not to smile at the mop-top nostalgia.__White's revelation-free, nostalgia massage of a film works the archivals with genuine fondness.__A surprisingly satisfying and moving experience.__White's film is a love letter not just to Kelly and the Beatles, but also to postwar working-class Liverpool.__Music documentaries don't get more inessential than Good Ol' Freda, a Kickstarter-funded, not-quite-profile of Freda Kelly, The Beatles' longtime secretary.__None__None__None__None
Shot with some wit and considerable speed, its short, sharp beatdowns are a refreshing change from the bloated action sequences favored by some of Mr. Kang's genre contemporaries.__Director Kang Woo-Suk spins an epic swirl of masculine psychodrama over his many punishing fight sequences, including flashbacks to the trio's origins as gifted scrappers who take one too many wrong turns.__At 2 1/2 hours, Fists of Legend goes on too long.

Another inkling of the style limitations perhaps most responsible for To's lower visibility stateside compared with, say, his countrymen John Woo and Wong Kar-wai.__[To] gives a solid 90 minutes of edgy foreplay before delivering the goods.__Few other working filmmakers display this degree of visual sophistication and old-school craftsmanship.__As always, To delivers fantastic set pieces ...__Drug War is a deeply intelligent, exhilarating and eminently satisfying adult crime story, one of the best thrillers you're likely to see this year.__An intense and constantly surprising crime story in which destiny seems to fold in on itself ...__To has a great mastery of timing; he knows just how long to let a look linger before cutting away, how little he can reveal without losing us.__Cars go crunch, bullets fly, blood spurts, bodies splatter and an unbelievable amount of cocaine is snorted. The climactic shootout, which goes on for 15 minutes and has an astronomical body count, is a masterpiece of its kind.__While Mr. To may not fill the movie with rousing speeches, either by inclination or out of political necessity, the brilliant, unsettling action scenes - ugly, savage, dehumanizing - speak volumes.__The big budget and big social canvas have called forth one of [To's] best movies, a dense and involving police procedural with a dash of the grotesque and a persistent undertone of doom.__The story's apparent hero is a police captain without the quirks and complications of To's usual cops. But a scriptwriting team that includes co-producer and longtime collaborator Wai Ka-fai takes the story in satisfyingly unexpected directions.__Drug War becomes both weightier and more playful with each transition, building to a harrowing finale.__It doesn't attempt to raise the stakes on its genre, but instead fully exploits what's there, piecing together an elaborate narc campaign tale out of classic cliches and tight-knot plotting ...__The genre thrills are as potent as the story's themes ...__Hong Kong action maestro Johnnie To takes his genre filmmaking savvy to the mainland in Drug War, a nail-biter that's actually quite light on action but so well-scripted and shot, it's nonetheless edge-of-your-seat material.__Dynamic chase film hits all the right buttons to fascinate edge-of-seat cop op addicts.__"Drug War" is by no means a bad film, but it doesn't do much to push the needle of originality, and doesn't glide enough to represent perfection of the genre.__None__None__None
An especially pointed variation on one of music's most oft-told tales: A band formed ahead of its time sits in muffled obscurity while others reap the harvest of what it first planted.__Fortunately, Bobby and Dannis, the surviving brothers, prove genial company.__If the brothers seem a little drunk on their own myth, they're also genuinely humbled by the band's rediscovery and warmed by the fact that their kids have carried on the family tradition.__A Band Called Death shines the light on a previously unexplored corner of musical history and does it in an accessible, straightforward manner.__Their story can feel almost too ready-made for the telling, but it's well worth a listen.__... a must-watch for fans of punk music, vinyl record wonks, or even those interested ... a visionary entertainment dream.__[A] generous, spirited documentary [that captures] one of the strangest and most inspiring of all family stories of tragedy and triumph that this crazy country has produced.__It was fans' ardor that began the Death revival and propels the movie's exhilarating second half.__If you're looking for a 96-minute jolt of joy, look no further than this uplifting, well-made documentary ...__The film is nothing much cinematically, and some of the narrative details and circumstances seemed fudged.

There is something refreshing in the decidedly downbeat "Europa Report," a science-fiction film with the emphasis on science that doesn't cheat on the tension.__Low key and earnest, Sebastian Cordero's "Europa Report" makes compelling use of familiar genre material to create an intelligent science fiction thriller.__There are scenes of unutterable beauty in Europa Report, a low-budget space exploration sci-fi suspenser from Ecuadorian director Sebastian Cordero.__What isn't straightforward about the plot is either hackneyed, implausible, or both.__The idea that life evolved independently on Europa is perfectly plausible-and that makes what would be a fun and exciting film in any case all the more worth watching.__I'm not qualified to judge the accuracy of the scientific detail, though the filmmakers convey a genuine respect for hard science instead of the cursory interest shown by most science fiction movies.__If this isn't quite a great movie, it should be an immensely gratifying one for sci-fi fans tired of the conceptual overkill and general dumbness of "Prometheus" or "Star Trek Into Darkness."__Working from Philip Gelatt's script, Cordero keeps things consistent, elegant and streamlined. "Europa Report" actually may be understated to a fault, but that's preferable to gratuitous melodrama.__The real treat here is the science, not the fiction. The film's sleek aesthetic was developed in consultation with NASA about what such a mission would actually require, and look like as viewed on surveillance cameras.__This sincerity, coupled with a documentary-style approach, can feel a little dry, but the script's refusal to go to extremes only raises its plausibility.__"Europa Report" is a Grade A version of a B picture, a streamlined science fiction story that smartly tells a familiar tale without breaking the bank.__While Europa Report recalls such small-ensemble stuck-in-space flicks as Moon and Sunshine, it's basically The Blair Witch Project relocated to the vicinity of Jupiter.__There are genuinely chilling moments in "Europa Report," thanks in no small part to a talented cast that will likely look familiar to viewers, even if the actors' names aren't instantly recognizable.__"Europa Report" goes ploddingly where bolder films have gone before.__Finally, a found-footage thriller that merits, and expands on, this irrationally popular format.__There's something adventurous about dicing a deep-space opus into home-video fragments. Call it one small step for found-footage, and leave it at that.__Simply put, the care and thoughtfulness that goes into footage-faking has not been applied to the film's script or structure.__The sights are gorgeous-a seamless mix of archival imagery and impressively rendered digital views of our galaxy-and the science is, to layman's eyes and ears, more than credible.__Some viewers might have preferred a stronger finale, but the movie manages to raise provocative scientific questions about our place in the universe while also delivering some neat, understated thrills.__Its high-minded emphasis on exploration and impeccable special effects are pitted against a familiar one-by-one slasher-like plot and structural cheats...
The final shot, with windshield wipers struggling to clean away a torrent of muddy water, suggests that no human agency is great enough to handle this world's misery.__"Beyond the Hills" seethes with astonishment and rage at a broken society marooned between the 21st century and the 16th.__It is a haunting movie, dealing with superstitions, possession, even exorcism, one in which Mungiu poses no easy answers, because there are none to be found.__It's an enigmatic and austere film from a region where political, sexual and religious repression are as stifling as the sooty air.__If you long for the bleak intelligence of an Ingmar Bergman film, where humankind is deeply flawed and God is indifferently silent and the landscape is cloaked in perpetual winter, then Beyond the Hills promises to be your cup of despair.__There are no easy villains or heroes in this sad and slow but forcefully told tale, which exhibits the same humanity Mungiu brought to 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, his abortion drama that won the 2007 Palme d'Or.__A film that asks its viewer to consider the nature of good and evil, love and trust - and trust that turns into something like blind faith.__The film offers rewards for the patient viewer as it examines conflicting visions of love played out in a remote faith-based community.__An austere but subtly textured retelling of a 2005 news story in which a young woman died during an exorcism.__Fascinating [and] anguishing ...__Cristian Mungiu's "Beyond the Hills" moves so effortlessly through the gnarly intersection of love, loss, God and godlessness that you barely notice how much he's doing, and with such effortless grace.__Of all the movies culminating in a rite of exorcism, Romanian writer-director Cristian Mungiu's remarkable "Beyond the Hills" stands alone.__One of the year's most powerful films.__The complexity of the film's moral world makes the movie far more than a simple anti-religious screed.__Beyond the Hills may be the best movie no one will want to see in 2013.__The movie is a series of longueurs that don't add up to a grand design -- at 2-1/2 hours, it's unnecessarily repetitive -- but it has moments when the spiritual and the secular burst forth in stunning disarray.__At times the pace of "Beyond the Hills" is nerve-wrackingly slow. But Mungiu has his own way of creating suspense, and he has a gift for making a known outcome as shocking as a twist.__Mingiu used to be a journalist, and "Beyond the Hills" has the feel of real-life to it - no soaring soundtrack music, a cast full of everyday faces.__Mungiu's quietly gripping film challenges expectations, refusing to merely lay forth an argument against benighted religion or to make Alina a simple victim.__"Beyond the Hills" is a tough and engrossing work of realism, set in rural Romania in the dead of winter, but it also has some of the shadowy magic of an ancient folk tale.
Noujaim's film attests to how quickly joyous weeping in the streets gave way to sectarian arguments over the army's role and fissures in promising alliances.__If the resulting film is unwieldy - five editors, five "additional editors," and six assistant editors are credited - it also brims with angry urgency.__The camera becomes a revolutionary: running, chasing, breathlessly jittery, up in the face of interrogators.__Epitomizes nonfiction film not just as a way to deepen knowledge and understanding, but also as an art form.__What does a revolution feel like from the inside?

Noujaim takes us inside this history by centering on three protesters, each from a different background.__The Square understands that the Revolution itself is a work in progress, and while its immediacy means it, too, will soon be superseded, it stands as a vigorous, useful account.__A powerhouse documentary that takes us into the eyes of several storms.__"The Square" bears witness to history in an articulate, thoughtful and intensely dramatic way.__"The Square" stands as a valuable document of a tormented time, an anatomy of a revolutionary movement doomed by a paucity of viable institutions, and by the movement's failure to advance a coherent agenda.__"The Square" isn't a nuanced or complete view of Egyptian politics, but it's an enthralling view of fervent reformists, willing to go back to Tahrir as often as it takes.__"The Square," while it records the gruesome collision of utopian aspirations with cold political realities, is not a despairing film.__Ultimately, one of the principal appeals of the D.C.-born Egyptian-American filmmaker's documentary is its intimacy.__Pulses with an immediacy that will leave you simultaneously enlightened and stunned.__Think of The Square as a bulletin from the front-one of many to come, in all likelihood.__The Square offers more than just pictures of a revolution; it lets you into the mind-set of those fighting for their future, and that makes all the difference.__The Square moves quickly, its reams of raw footage complemented by fleet and skillful editing.__The Square is inner-world-shaking.__None__None

[A] bittersweet, frustratingly impressionistic documentary ...__Loose and ragtag, stirring and poignant, the documentary "Ain't in It for My Health: A Film About Levon Helm" proves a fitting tribute to its late star ...__The portrait of the ailing artist is bittersweet, but when Helms sings or plays, the look on his face is pure joy.__Less than satisfying treatment of beloved musician, who never quite lets his guard down.__It's a sympathetic portrait of an artist whose heart lay more with new work than old glories, right up to the end.__An affectionate tribute and a gift for fans who grew fond of his company on records or at concerts and who would like a little bit more.__Director Jacob Hatley clearly earned the complete trust of Helm's inner circle, enough to capture the icon's crusty humor, singular talent and significant bravery in the face of his fate.__Despite his flashes of bitterness, the Helm captured here seems like a man at peace with where he ended up - however taxing the road that brought him, however many friends lost or discarded along the way.__An unsentimental, salt-of-the-earth tribute that keeps the beat in a way that would make this extraordinary journeyman beam.__For the fans left bereft by his 2012 death, it's impossible to imagine a more exquisite, honest, and beautifully detailed documentary about the life of Levon Helm than Jacob Hatley's Ain't in It for My Health.__[A] fascinating if not entirely revealing portrait.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Yet another smoothly produced doc for the foodie set.__Plays to sentiment in its second half but you can't help but admire the tenacity of these people, who have been tested repeatedly in almost Biblical fashion, yet come out swinging.__Though these stories have little to do with each other, all are gripping, and you watch the last third of "Spinning Plates" rapt.__While the dramatic conflicts in the film are set up in a rather rote manner (meet the personalities, fret over their setbacks, sigh at the resolution), the human stories here are undeniably moving.__The tales are worthwhile, but it's challenging to find a common thread among them that goes beyond vague generalities.__The movie doesn't always feel cohesive, but the stories are unexpectedly touching.__I must warn those of you who are sucrose intolerant that it might get cloying at first, or even dangerous to your health. But for those who can handle it, the piece de resistance is worth the wait.__Episodic doc could use more focus on food preparation, but vividly captures the human element involved.__Ultimately, the portrayal of community fostered by delicious food makes a sound case for patronizing independent eateries.__This dully structured film makes its points early and often, treading water before a purposely delayed big finish.__Foodie phantasmagoria and something more.__Joseph Levy's sneakily stirring documentary opens up feelings you would never have expected from the premise-a portrait of three American restaurants.__Levy chose the sites well and does a nice job juxtaposing the owners' passions and persistence. All three restaurants have faced their share of trials, to say the least.__As separate snapshots of three fascinating businesses, it's vivid and engaging.__The overall effect is not unlike watching a chef de cuisine experimenting in his off-hours; not everything takes.__Splendid and engrossing ... a love letter to that singular intersection of artistic innovation, cultural legacy, community pride, and family-sustaining (or -straining) commerce known as the restaurant.__So involving that one might not notice until afterward that little in the way of a unified theme emerges to turn Joseph Levy's feature into something more than a semi-random survey of restaurant life.__None__None__None
Page's natural beauty, charisma and genuine sense of fun - not to mention her 36-24-37 measurements - come clearly through in Mori's tale.__An amateurish and oddly paced documentary, "Bettie Page Reveals All" nonetheless turns out to be revealing, if perhaps not in the way its makers intended.__The best thing about this documentary portrait of the beloved 1950s pin-up is its meaty narration, courtesy of Page herself, speaking in the low, slightly gravelly register of an aging Southern belle.__The film offers frank, matter-of-fact commentary that is far more illuminating than the talking-head encomiums served up by the likes of Perez Hilton, Dita Von Teese, and Hugh Hefner.__The film's reason for being, though, is the sound of Page's voice -- a worldly, aged Southern drawl -- as she recounts her life story from childhood through retirement.__A scintillating, sincere and empathetic portrait of the pinup queen who attained her greatest influence as an icon of female sexuality decades after she retired.__Only when it makes the claim for Page as a pivotal figure in American culture does it overstate the case and become tiresome.__This documentary portrait of the famous 50s pinup model contends that Page was a progressive figure because she always controlled how her body was objectified. That's such a provocative premise that one wishes the movie explored it in greater depth.__[A] highly watchable portrait.__The film's ... well-directed by Mark Mori, and Page's story - told in a Southern drawl as thick as sorghum - is a fascinating one.__She got a big kick out of posing in the buff, the film makes clear, and saw no contradiction between her sensuality and the Christian faith she practiced all her life.__It tends to lurch distractingly, as if Mr. Mori were still trying to figure out how to piece the whole thing together.__Mori gives us a delightful nostalgia trip, illustrated with lots of stunning, once-scandalous photos of Page in her prime. We even hear from the deeply private icon herself, in voiceover interviews recorded before her death in 2008.__Her enduring appeal is amply documented in myriad vintage photos and clips deployed, while erstwhile collaborators and latter-day admirers add their two cents.__Much of the movie consists of footage and stills from Page's life and career, and face it: Looking at Page for some 90 minutes is a pleasure unto itself. But her actual voice gives the movie its richness.__None__None__None__None__None
By the film's end, it's clear what Augustine is running from, but it's hard to grasp where she was in the first place.__That the film raises interesting questions might be good enough, except that, while the movie goes about denying us information we want, it gives us details we don't need. "Augustine" churns slowly and doesn't make for compelling viewing.__French physician Jean-Martin Charcot hypnotized, photographed and exhibited a hysteric, as does French director Alice Winocour for a clinical love story and empowerment tale.__Ultimately, while this character-based drama proves consistently engrossing, it leaves various pertinent and fascinating issues frustratingly unexplored.__The psychosexual drama plays out beneath the surface -- the movie is so understated it sometimes feels inert.__Fiercely yet faithfully imagined by... Alice Winocur, [the film] is not exclusively a mystery. It's also part love story, part horror story, as well as a parable of gender, power and the enduring enigma that is the mind-body connection.__Winocour does not reduce her characters to caricatures, but depicts them as unwitting actors in the tragedy of a pathological society.__Though the tone is solemn, I took the finale as a knowing, agreeably dirty joke.__The writer-director Alice Winocour creates a kind of subdued excitement of discovery.__The hysterics contained in Alice Winocour's "Augustine" -- and "hysteria" is what it's about -- can't obscure the understated, smoldering subtext of what is a sometimes playfully smart and irony-laden story.__Vague conjurings of mood take the place of insight, sentiment takes the place of complexity, and a clumsy and superficial attention to the rigid script keeps the movie from coming to life.__A dark, and rather disturbing debut.__Winocour skillfully films Augustine being exhibited for other doctors in several disturbingly erotic scenes, but elsewhere Soko's stolid, one-note demeanor takes a toll.__Soko is terrific, but it is Mr. Lindon who delivers the performance of the film, his internalized consternation amounting to an eloquent dispatch from the war between the sexes.__Ms. Winocour is not inclined to turn "Augustine" into a neatly moralized fable of a predator and his victim. Rather, the film is what might be called a melodrama of transference ...__Visually, the film conjures the past with shadowy interiors and harsh light. Winocour, who also scripted, often makes her points without words.__[A] somber, intelligent period drama ...__Its world is small but convincing.__The film is something of a paradox, simultaneously passionate and dispassionate, its ending tethered to both bruised triumph and a sense of things falling apart.__Plays like a gothic prequel to David Cronenberg's A Dangerous Method, one in which human flesh is viewed as both horrific and erotic terrain.
It feels thorough, and very affectionate. It just needs more of a narrative hook, a through-line from start to finish that can enhance the story for those not yet in the club.__All the making-of footage and scenes offering a taste of Memphis in the '70s will probably thrill established Big Star lovers in a big way.__"Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me" is no doubt going to please fans of the cult rock band, but the rest of us may feel like outsiders - not put off by the proceedings, really, but somewhat mystified as to what all the fuss is about.__[Documents] the band's coming together and falling apart and [offers] a passionate tribute to its brilliant, beautiful music.__[A] thoroughly detailed (though a bit long) doc that charts the band's thwarted expectations.__Don't think of "Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me" as a sad tale. Cautionary, maybe. Mostly it's a celebration of a great band making great music, if only for a short time.__Drew DeNicola and Olivia Mori's lovingly assembled documentary inventories the near-misses and noble failures that comprised Big Star's short career, as well as the tragedies that occurred after they'd stopped recording.__It seems like a bittersweet inevitability that even a celebration as reverential as this one is suffused with such aching poignancy.__The film certainly gives the band its due, but it will likely appeal more to Big Star cultists, ones eager for minutia about recording and business deals.__Overall, it's still a skillfully rendered narrative that should satisfy fans and pique the interest of the uninitiated.__By the end, I was muttering at every critic and musician and record producer, "Guys, tell me something I don't know."__The story that writer-director Drew DeNicola and producer-director Olivia Mori reconstruct has the power to move even those who prefer Mozart or Lil Wayne.__DiNicola explores the specifics of Big Star's implosion as well as anyone can, considering band breakups are much like shattered love affairs: Who ever really knows what went wrong?__A well-sourced account of a perfect, broken dream, Drew DeNicola and Olivia Mori's slightly shaggy documentary captures what it's like to discover music so good it seems as if it were made just for you.__Whether this love letter is more preaching to the converted than a corrective is arguable.__It's a tale of extraordinary creative accomplishment followed by bitter rejection; fused with the band's lonely music, which DeNicola samples liberally on the soundtrack, it has the power of a pop myth.__If Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me leads even one person to listen to Big Star for the first time, this movie will have done a great service.__Rock doc is a boon to members of the Big Star cult.__None__None
Soon enough the worlds of Up Top and Down Below feel like distractions, CGI Potemkin villages.__A Romeo and Juliet story for the age of CGI overkill, Upside Down zigs where it should zag and dulls where it should dazzle.__Absent any emotional grounding, the film is a gorgeous, sterile construction, like a dream city unoccupied by humans.__Simply put, this is one of the craziest films to come along in a while and I can confidently say that anyone who sees it will either hail it is some kind of crackpot masterpiece or dismiss it as one of the silliest damn things they've ever seen.__It doesn't really develop its story, or its themes. It doesn't truly draw out its characters. It evokes no serious emotions. It has - in the end - no gravity.__"Upside Down" is such a gorgeous wreck that I could almost sense Terry Gilliam somewhere muttering, "Wait a minute, I should have been the one to screw up this idea."__"Upside Down" paints a pretty picture, as long as you don't think about it too much.__The only problem is that, after creating the most wonderful fantastic frame, "Upside Down" doesn't devise a picture worthy of it.__The novelty of the idea, which suggests a less elegant offshoot of M. C. Escher drawings, quickly wears thin. The production design is too busy, and the film's desaturated palette is forbiddingly austere.__Just enjoy its dazzling visuals, dream-like inventiveness and lush romanticism.__At a time when so many movies look alike, and studio productions sometimes look aggressively ugly, here's a quirky vision at the intersection of sci-fi and romance.__Despite its undeniably clever conceit and visuals, this love story set in twin worlds remains earthbound.__Timothy Spall enlivens this as a crafty engineer in the corporation where Dunst and Sturgess work, but they're all just props in a dream whose logic hasn't been quite worked out.__Though "Upside Down" starts with a strong idea, its compelling conceit is immediately weighed down by leaden execution.__"Upside Down" gives you four movies for the price of one.__Moment for moment, Upside Down is the most embarrassing, hilarious, obliviously stupid movie since M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening, and its constant pursuit of a striking image over any other consideration undermines it at every turn.__Is the film something to look at? Yes. "Upside Down" is something to look at. But that's not enough for a full-length, full-bodied, romance.__Upside Down is a very fancy piece of junk.__True originality is so rare that it's a treat to welcome a movie as completely different and provocative as Upside Down. It's unlike anything you have ever seen.__Dunst is radiant, as always, though it's radiance with depth: She's not just your average dream girl; she's gravity's rainbow. But there just isn't enough of her.
A potentially incisive character study is buried under layers of fluff in The English Teacher.__Apropos of its title, The English Teacher feels like a movie written as a homework assignment.__The report card for low-key high school comedy The English Teacher would read something like this: Weak effort; this student is too easily distracted, fails to follow through and turns in unfinished work.__Pleasant is the perfect word with which to describe The English Teacher, an ingratiating little comedy that aims to please and succeeds at its modest goal.__The movie doesn't do enough with its cast or its idea; it's an underachiever that simply doesn't try hard enough.__A screwball comedy that could have been screwier, "The English Teacher" is as interesting for its cast as its content.__Perversely determined to make you laugh. You're more likely to squirm, though ...__Like so many small films carrying the Tribeca Films label, this seriocomic farce has its moments, but fails to live up to the promise of a starry cast headed by Julianne Moore.__The script eases into a toothless comedy about an alum's unproduced play, an awful-sounding suicide drama championed by Moore's character like the second coming of Odets.__Under Craig Zisk's frisky direction, the entire cast is superb and wrinkle-free. The screenplay, by husband-wife team Dan and Stacy Chariton, is thin as a poker chip but as clever as it is contrived.__Greg Kinnear does a nice supporting job as Jason's dad.__This is a brisk comedy, with some formulaic moments made better by a top-notch cast ...__"The English Teacher" is a tragedy masquerading as a comedy and doing a disservice to both.__Even the sitcom stylings might not matter if the movie were funny, but in spite of the potential for Guffman-esque comedy, The English Teacher boasts few surprises ...__The English Teacher reveals that a respectable cast and much noisy boisterousness isn't enough to generate a single laugh.__Benefits from a brisk pace, witty banter and engaging performances, yet still fades from memory faster than a final exam on the first day of summer vacation.__Rudderless in its presentation and outright stupid in its central conceits__None__None__None
Amid all the copycatting and pricey bombast and genericness, here's a movie that looks like it hails from a real place; whose characters sound like they come from somewhere; whose stakes are stresslessly low.__'Gimme the Loot' is ... meandering and a little shallow. And even at 79 minutes it feels a little too long for what's essentially the film equivalent of a short story.__A thousand-watt jolt of mischief, a spunky, funky, ebullient indie that packs its 81 minutes with cinematic exhilaration.__It may be a slight movie, but it has its sunny charms.__A movie about teenage taggers in the Bronx should be fast and raw, scruffy and loose, and Adam Leon's Gimme the Loot is just that.__As it lopes along, the movie offers a warm but very sharp portrait of New York's have-nots and their uneasy relationship with the haves.__"Gimme the Loot" shouldn't be as appealing and exuberant as it is, it really shouldn't.__Tashiana Washington and Ty Hickson are terrific in the main roles. So is Zoe Lescaze as Ginnie, a spoiled white kid who teaches the taggers a thing or two about drift and being dissolute.__Small but bursting with energy.__There's barely enough narrative to sustain even an 81-minute picture, yet a sweet spirit buoys this quick-witted, amiably foul-mouthed indie.__This is a simple, meandering, slice-of-life indie film that feels more authentic than most "gritty" New York films with infinitely larger budgets.__The idea is good but the result is saccharine; the movie plays more like an outline that's still awaiting its point of view.__... 'Gimme the Loot' isn't the kind of film where a lot happens, but that's it's small-scale magic ...__"Gimme the Loot" winds up as a shaggy-dog story built largely out of digressions, but the punch line is tender, as is Leon's attitude toward being young and poor in New York.__A warm and wonderfully discursive slice-of-life story, with an emphasis on language and local color and a great feel for the longings of working-class adolescents.__Sofia is intense and unsmiling, while Malcolm is a charming, goofy chatterbox, and they make a vivid impression, even without spray paint.__Director Adam Leon, 31, has slyly and reverentially crafted a perfect New York movie, including the class tensions, relentless hustling and spontaneous connections that best define the exuberant strain of the city.__Want a bracing alternative to the usual Hollywood swill? Try Gimme the Loot, a fresh, funky jolt of filmmaking joy.__Gimme The Loot has an energy that's been missing from independent film lately. It's not dreary or quirky; not excessively stylish or stubbornly formless.__Adam Leon has created something unique and current, with affectionate nods to New York films of the past.
In the end, you simply wish the characters (and the actors) were in a more subtle and focused film. "Computer Chess" plays a risky game. Unfortunately, it loses.__A supremely intelligent, beautifully constructed film, interweaving comedy and character, satire and subtext__A breakthrough -- not just for indie writer-director Andrew Bujalski, but for American movie comedy.__It's impossible not to see "Computer Chess" as both a humble, low-fi ode to evanescence and the deceptively cute baby picture of the digital disrupters who will soon bestride the Earth.__A shambling, Altmanesque ensemble comedy.__You need no particular knowledge or affection for the game of kings to appreciate the whimsy of "Computer Chess."__It approaches its subjects not with the gleeful, madcap hilarity of a Christopher Guest mockumentary ("Best in Show," "A Mighty Wind"), but with the calculated precision of lines of code.__Bujalski is having fun with Night of the Living Dead, on a community-access palette. But I also can't think of another director who's come closer to capturing how antique technology would dream about us.__Presenting itself as a sort of found-footage movie for geeks, this amusing and thoughtful oddity by writer-director-editor Andrew Bujalski is upfront in form but more stealth in content and intent.__Bujalski isn't playing at Christopher Guest-like caricature. Instead of mocking this eccentric group, he climbs right inside their anxieties and ambitions.__A deadpan mock-documentary about an early-'80s gathering of programming nerds, arguing about AI and predictive algorithms and showing off questionable fashion choices and facial hair.__Bujalski doesn't give us enough in the way of story or characters, and "Computer Chess" eventually seems to just fade away; one of those movies, perhaps, that was more fun to make than it is to watch.__Watching "Computer Chess" is like opening an ancient Altair 8800 to peer at the tiny people inside.__This profound, peculiar work of genius, this half-comic portrait of the present in embryo within the past, reverberates with hidden meanings and a questing intelligence.__A punitively dull chunk of quirk that is about, and feels like, being stuck in a motel with a gaggle of programming nerds for a weekend.__Computer Chess is about the dawn - one of many, but that's another story - of the tech revolution. It's also a reminder that you don't need state-of-the-art toys to make a formally playful comedy about man versus machine.__Bujalski has a fantastic eye. The movie was shot in black and white with '70s video cameras, and could easily be mistaken for a documentary.__As an achievement, "Computer Chess" is laudable. As a film, it's missable.__The comedy of missed cues and social misdirection is a universal one, and there are a few more mainstream gags that connect reliably, from missed room reservations to run-ins with a human-potential convention.__Artificial intelligence remains an intoxicating theory and a heady possibility, about which I am hardly qualified to speak. But I do know real filmmaking intelligence when I see it.
A remarkably pretty, if equally dour, portrait of the bored, oppressive life led by the provincial bourgeoisie.__Exquisitely tasteful but suffocatingly dull ...__While there's a certain staid feeling to the production, it does deliver a solid working-over to the era's gentry.__The film looks great. As for the human element, the mood is more apathetic than tragic, and star Audrey Tautou has to take much of the blame for the film's failure.__The magnificent nature that surrounds Therese becomes her prison. It's an interesting paradox, but not necessarily an especially satisfying experience.__Mr. Miller's stolid approach - with its waxwork figures, postcard beauty, insistent tastefulness and glaze of politesse - feels far too comfortably of this world to mount a critique of it.__While not a nail-biter, the flowery dialogue (many elegant letters are read in voice-over), juicy twists and moral ambiguity make this a period piece worth slowing down for.__Miller's film is a work of emotional reserve, eschewing psychological explanation in favor of unadorned observation - of human behavior as well as nature and the still lifes of the domestic world.__[A] static, emotionless saga, which is defined less by zealous feeling than by a dull, decorous air of respectability.__The movie may look pretty and may plod, but it also leaves a bruise.__If the banality of life within the Bordeaux gentry is the point, then the ensuing oppressiveness is immaculately depicted through precise performances and camerawork-just don't call it emotionally engaging drama.__A classic story competently told, Therese Desqueyroux is chocolate-box heritage cinema at heart, but a perfectly respectable and emphatically French epitaph to Miller's long career.__Claude Miller's final film is tastefully upholstered, but the narrative generates little heat, empathy or momentum.__A tad on the stiff side.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Director Costa-Gavras takes a vaguely facetious tone toward the evils of global finance, which he concludes is a game for gluttonous boys.__It's a bit like what The Godfather would have been if it had been set in "The Bank of Evil" from Despicable Me -- and if its antihero were a cipher instead of Michael Corleone.__What's lacking is most surprising from this dissident filmmaker: the emotional outrage.__The famously left-leaning Costa-Gavras is preaching to the choir in his indignation, but he does so in slick, brisk fashion.__In the end, "Capital" is just a dark comic sketch of bald-faced greed, with little nuance or real feeling.__"Capital" is too cynical to ever really suggest that redemption is possible. Not that anyone watching will even care.__Fourth-grade Marxism that compares banking to the Mafia and shows the suits standing up and cheering when their boss promises to rob the poor to pay the rich.__Costa-Gavras' film excels as a meticulously researched procedural that goes deep into the grime of greed, deception and cynical exploitation.__"Capital" is a fairly engaging piece, and proof that an old director can still learn new tricks.__The movie, based on Stephane Osmont's 2004 novel of the same title, is stiff and didactic. Even the high life portrayed in the film seems pallid, as if the director were frozen in disgust.__This is territory covered far more vibrantly in "Margin Call," yet director Costa-Gavras ("Z," "Missing") still has good, old-fashioned indignation to count on.__The imagery is cliche, and therefore ineffective; the characters don't seem to operate in the world of finance, but in the world of financial thrillers.__Capital ends up being neither a high-stakes thriller nor a cutting commentary on real-world bad behavior. It's just CEO exotica, all dressed up with nowhere to go.__A serious European financial thriller is something of a novelty, and Costa-Gavras, the militant film master par excellence, shows perfect timing in his ambitious Capital, a film that lingers in the memory in spite of being rather irritating to watch.__A tacky corporate noir that makes you long for the leanness of Margin Call, or even the clumsy theatrics of Arbitrage ...__Bottom line: It's no Margin Call, but still worth your investment.__A cracking good melodrama set in a contemporary world of high finance and low cunning.__None__None__None
The film relies on terse dialogue and boggy colors to create an atmosphere dense with anxiety -- all well handled by director James March.__A respectable political/psychological suspenser, but not a wildly entertaining or enjoyable one.__A tautly minimalist, occasionally generic study of betrayal and family ties.__[Riseborough's] work is indrawn and riveting. It's hard to read the look in her eye, but we never stop trying.__This British thriller by James Marsh is a little too neatly scripted and tightly edited for my taste, but there are galvanizing performances from Andrea Riseborough... and Clive Owen.__These are characters for whom true belief in a cause has probably become impossible; they know how much that costs. Marsh does a compelling job of illustrating that for the rest of us.__Riseborough's ever-mobile face is a study as Collette cycles from hopelessness to panic to mama-bear rage.__The movie runs into the same problem all stories like this do: Generally, audiences don't like snitches.__The proceedings move so quietly and thoughtfully as to be occasionally somnolent, though they're punctuated with spasms of the violence that marked the Troubles.__The character mechanics ... leave the viewer always feeling a step ahead of the story and its too-late-to-excite twists.__Shadow Dancer feels like a thriller, but Marsh is wisely more interested in the tension than in the release. What thrills exist here are carefully tempered by the considered pacing.__"Shadow Dancer" is ominously subdued and grimly taciturn. The dialogue is minimal. Only what has to be said is said, and the tone of most of it is one of quiet urgency.__Riseborough once again transforms herself dramatically, expanding her role as best she can. But neither the hesitant script - adapted by Tom Bradby from his own novel - nor the sluggish tempo give her enough support.__Director James Marsh, best known for his documentaries Man On Wire and Project Nim, crafts an atmosphere of tenuous dread.__The movie eventually wafts into a detective story, which would be doubly effective if only we could hack our way through the thickly coated Irish brogues that render so much of the dialogue incomprehensible.__There's slow-burning, and then there's simply slow; the difference between the two has never been so apparent.__The film rests on the desperate chemistry of a paunchy, weathered Owen and a tense, quietly ferocious Riseborough.__While it's hard to grumble about such a smart, intelligent drama after a summer of big bangs, its slow pace at times feels sluggish.__James Marsh's gripping thriller set in Northern Ireland demands patience and concentration of its audience, but the impeccably crafted film is well worth the effort.__Riseborough gives a tremendously vulnerable and resolute turn as a protector at home and avenger abroad forced to reconsider the extent to which she is capable of avoiding the crossfire on all sides.
The documentary clarifies the breadth of the autism spectrum, from those who lack basic language and/or motor skills to those at the high-functioning end who do not seek a "cure" but rather social acceptance in the name of neurological diversity.__Although it favors breadth over depth, the documentary The United States of Autism offers a tender look at an eclectic array of children, their parents and other individuals affected by this ever-increasing developmental disability.__This emotional documentary succeeds in putting a human face on this growing health issue.__Amateurish and rushed.__Yes, the animated opening sequence has a professional polish that the rest of the film lacks, but the documentary's chosen angle is meaningful: The world of autism is as diverse as the nation.__The United States of Autism is an example of a well-meaning documentary that may do more harm than good.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Only a cynic wouldn't appreciate the sincerity at work in "One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das."__Despite its handful of emotional, soul-baring moments, "One Track Heart"... has a once-over-lightly feeling that disappoints.__Insights are few in this fan letter of a documentary.__An engaging look at the era of enlightenment-seeking when young, shaggy-haired Americans experimented with LSD and traveled to India seeking answers.__Jeremy Frindel's workmanlike docu proceeds in a matter-of-fact manner that neither ignores nor belabors the inspirational aspect of its story.__Despite its spiritual subject matter, this documentary doesn't dig very deep.__A fine enough documentary, a nice enough introduction to a charismatic figure with a fascinating life, an unusual art and worldwide fans.__Frindel can't rescue Kagel from marginalization as a New Agey preacher man, but he does portray this hippest of all Krishnas as someone who deeply believes in the self-sacrificing mantra he chants ...__Modest and affecting, it's a portrait of the possibility of finding peace, contentment and self through both music and spirituality.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Twisted, sad and undeniably disturbing, "The Silence" is a study in the sick ways of men.__This is film noir at its noirest.__A story of obsession, of the permanence of loss, of how deeds of the past haunt us, closing over our heads like water. It leaves you shivering, yet thrilled; waiting anxiously for this talented new filmmaker's next work.__"The Silence" is framed as a multi-character police procedural, but like "Mystic River" and "Zodiac," its inquiries probe deeper and darker.__Its measured pacing whispers art while its lurid subject matter screams commerce.__The most rewarding element in the picture is the performance of the first girl's mother by Katrin Sass, who gives us quietly and darkly what it is like to live with the memory of your child's murder.__"The Silence" is a victim of over-plotting, clunky narrative, gratuitous stylization, and too many points of view.__Nicely paced but rotely characterized.__The mysteries here are larger, deeper, more ineffable than the purely practical concerns of crime-solving: motive, means and opportunity.__These are our modern tearjerkers, embellished with sexual violence to maintain the audience's sense of its own sophistication. Include me out.__A clear-eyed look at the hole that a death leaves behind, and the many awkward and always insufficient ways we try to fill it.__The Silence, an assured first feature from Swiss-born director Baran Bo Odar, has more on its mind than most crime thrillers.__"The Silence" is an exemplary German-language thriller, a complex and disturbing examination of guilt, violence and psychological torment that chills us to the core not once but two times over.__[Mr. Odar uses] graceful wide-screen compositions and haunting sound design to create a compelling mood of menace, anxiety and sorrow.__Swiss-born director Baran bo Odar's second feature film is a finely crafted psychological drama that uses a brutal crime to delve into the depths of human misery.__What had seemed like a lackluster ensemble piece turns out to be an exercise in empathy ...__"The Silence" is more like an intriguing work of misdirection than a great crime film, but it has a dreamlike and disturbing undertow you won't soon forget, and Odar is unquestionably a director to watch.__The Silence speaks volumes.__Making his feature debut, Swiss-born writer/director Baran bo Odar has turned Jan Costin Wagner's 2007 novel The Silence into a taut, beautifully acted thriller.__None
The brutally efficient shooting style Reeves employs to film master choreographer Yuen Woo Ping's breathtaking fights is refreshingly grounded and old-school kinetic.__Reeves has clearly seen many Hong Kong films, and with the help of two veterans, Hollywood cinematographer Elliot Davis and HK editor Derek Hui, he's replicated one.__Keanu Reeves makes his directorial debut in a cartoonish kung fu movie with splashy fight scenes and an underdeveloped wit.__Don't get too hopeful for greatness, but the damned thing works.__[An] ambitious but generic martial-arts movie.__The fights are spectacular - Tiger Chen doesn't need wires - the camera work is cool, the music sizzling.__A glorious romp of a martial-arts thwack-fest ...__A modestly entertaining martial arts melodrama with impressively staged fight sequences that help compensate for a stale plot and some less-than-stellar acting.__An episode of "The Ultimate Fighter" has more variation and better lines, too.__Keanu Reeves's down-and-dirty and generally diverting directing debut.__Without Chen in the lead role, Man of Tai Chi could easily have been chop-socky awful.__Will anyone other than hardcore martial arts junkies pay good money to watch this stuff, which I admit, in smaller doses, holds a powerful visual/visceral fascination?__Like Reeves' wooden dialogue, it's fun despite not being very good.__Reeves's debut shows signs of a talented filmmaker.__Say what you will about Keanu Reeves, he knows his strengths. So for his first directorial effort, he chose to do a martial-arts flick with a postmodern tinge.__Reeves gets plenty of mileage from this premise, using it to comment on globalization, cinema in the Internet age, and the moral cost of selling out.__Feet and fists move with the camera, and angles orient the combatants in space. Even Reeves-who has a stiff-legged, Frankenstein's-monster-like fighting style-ends up looking like a formidable physical presence.__[Establishes Reeves] as a deft helmer of cinematic combat ...__This hackneyed misfit resuscitates every cliche of the grade-B '80s Hong Kong martial arts programmer, even the plot parts that were already imitating bad American TV.__The third act marks a commendably goofy sea change in an otherwise agreeably average throwback.
Coolly controlled and extremely well-acted.__Spare yet deeply atmospheric, the film is charged with dreadful fatalism.__The film creates one of the most chillingly becalmed portraits of insanity I've seen.__This lyrical, frightening film is a portrait of a man consumed by self-hatred who decided to take it out on the world.__If Moors and Porto were aiming for gun-debate relevance, they've failed; "Blue Caprice" has nothing to say about a society plagued by violence, nor does it focus on mental illness as a probable cause.__The film's a character piece with a tightening noose of suspense, and while it has its artsy-indie-dawdly moments, it's disturbing in ways that aren't easy to shake.__"Blue Caprice" doesn't offer the sense of catharsis or closure, let alone new information, that makes it more than a cold, if disciplined, directorial exercise.__Although the actors are fine, writer-director Alexandre Moors's feature debut suffers from a lulling tonal sameness.__Moors is neither showy nor exploitative in his telling of the story. He just lays out the details, making "Blue Caprice" not just a story of horror, but of tragedy.__The grainy texture of the imagery is darkly arresting. Isaiah Washington is charismatic and fearsome, channeling a toxic mix of compassion and rage.__The entire movie is an experiment in disturbance -- that of the characters, as well as the audience. The results are nerve-racking, and resonant.__Despite the solid performances from Washington and Richmond, we get a little bored and begin waiting to see what will happen (or, more precisely, how the filmmakers will handle the ending) ...__Don't miss it.__Blue Caprice takes a true story of violence and panic and tells it in the most artful, understated manner imaginable - which makes its events even more powerful.__The movie substitutes milky, washed-out color and funereal music for insight.__It's the exploration of their human frailty and their brokenness, and the step-by-step examination of the events that would lead to this barbarity, that give Blue Caprice its intensity.__May be a frustrating film for viewers looking for a straight piece of historical fiction...This is no photograph, but an impressionistic sketch of the communicability of evil - and in that respect it's a powerful piece of filmmaking.__Viewers may crave more anatomy of murder, but unlike Mr. Muhammad, Mr. Moors isn't on a mission. What he and his actors are interested in is character.__To the relief of the public around the District of Columbia, the Beltway sniper case was solved a long time ago. But in some respects, Mr. Moors's haunting film suggests, it is still a mystery.__I understand Moors' impulse to avoid both tidy moral explanations and sensationalistic gore, but we don't spend long enough with either victims or perpetrators to get a sense of what those terrible few weeks in Washington were like.
What we have here is a tale of lust, deception, manipulation and murder. Quintessential De Palma, in other words.__One's ultimate reaction is likely to one of indifference, bemusement or outright disdain considering the pedigree of the filmmaker helming the project: Brian De Palma.__A throwaway by a gifted filmmaker who has run out of ideas.__Despite De Palma's lavish proof of what he can accomplish with classical technique, the movie comes off as too much for too little, a collection of mechanisms that decorate mechanisms.__After the clinically dull first half, it's more desperate pantry raid than feast.__Entrancing and narcotizing in about equal measure.__I have no objection to DePalma laughing at himself. But his heart's not in it. Neither is his libido. Passion lacks the promise of its title. It's dead inside.__"Passion" is often sleek and enjoyable, dispensing titillation, suspense and a few laughs without taking itself too seriously.__Mostly it's another opportunity for this most self-referential of directors to dip once again into his well-worn bag of tricks.__In a film that isn't so good ... excess becomes a lot less enjoyable. And "Passion" isn't so good.__With no heat at all and a woefully disjointed cast, De Palma's danse macabre never catches fire.__One of [De Palma's] sillier and trashier pictures, with nothing much to recommend it apart from those long-delayed bravura sequences.__Passion turns into vintage De Palma - which is to say, the film seems almost engineered to get you giggling at the extravagance of its absurdity.__Those who submit to the movie's spell may well find themselves giddy at how viscerally and confidently an old master can deploy the tools of his trade.__Passion is pretty good. If you cared enough to make a list, it might be your fifth or sixth favorite De Palma.__This tarted-up English-language remake affords some modestly campy pleasures, but lacks the delirious trash-horror verve of De Palma's best work.__Passion smacks of self-parody; by the time De Palma makes his way to some intended-to-be-jolting final shots, I found myself laughing out loud at his shamelessness.__Where Corneau flirted with erotic tension, De Palma flaunts it. Where Corneau went for nightmarish reality, De Palma does noirish dreams.__it will no doubt find its boosters__Remaking Alain Corneau's 2010 French noir Love Crime proves less a comeback for De Palma and more what economists call a 'dead cat bounce.'
__It's all kind of cute. Maybe a little too cute, but it does have a nice circle-of-life ending.__The film itself is so charming that you almost forget to ask whether these people truly deserve our empathy.__The time-killing universe Byington has created makes sure we never forget how absurd he thinks the whole movie is. Fun for him, perhaps.__American cinema has been churning out slacker movies for what seems like eons, so it's refreshing to report that Somebody Up There Likes Me enlivens the genre with a welcome breath of imagination, wit and charm.__The film itself is so charming that you almost forget to ask whether these people truly deserve our empathy.__Words such as offbeat, charming or, Lord help us, quirky are wildly overused and yet this is exactly the kind of film to which they best apply.__Highly original and delightfully unorthodox.__Bob Byington's imaginative indie comedy recalls some of Richard Lester's 60s films in its freewheeling narrative structure and cartoonish sight gags, though the humor is more often peculiar than laugh-out-loud funny.__A film distinguished entirely by its stubborn refusal to engage viewers in any way whatsoever.__If nonchalance were an Olympic sport, Max would be a gold medalist, and watching Somebody Up There Likes Me is about as much fun as being a spectator at that event might sound.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Jordan is no stranger to the yearnings of vampires. He directed Interview With the Vampire. But Byzantium is a kinder, gentler yet pretty durn bloody affair.__Go ahead, bite.__A drama that feels both strenuously earnest and impossible to take seriously.__Byzantium has a few moves that might surprise you. They have nothing to do with blood, but everything to do with the heart.__A confusing yet eye-pleasing tale that struggles to breathe new life into the well-worn mythology.__Neil Jordan's sensitive and very slow exploration of vampire angst. That the film also seems intended as some kind of vampire feminist statement makes it a rare combination of mildly boring and mildly hilarious.__The story drags a bit, bouncing back and forth in time in a manner that is sometimes useful, sometimes not. Overall, though, it's an intriguing addition to the genre.__It's a pleasure to see a vampire movie that aspires to something artful, and that explores the misery that comes with living - forever - on blood, and in the shadows.__The film slows and slumps as it ventures into a historical backstory, complete with a mysterious brotherhood, an ancient map, and Sam Riley in a wig worse than death.__Lines like "The pearl stays pure while the oyster's flesh rots around it" or "Would you like to kiss me? In celebration of my wickedness?" confound any efforts to make them sound less than ridiculous.__Mother/daughter conflict runs deeper - and much, much longer - than usual in this gorgeous, brooding, fascinatingly female-centric vampire saga, which also gushes waterfalls of blood.__"Byzantium" dares to rework "Twilight" with twice the teen moping and Robert Pattinson replaced by a guy with the sexual magnetism of a sickly Ron Weasley.__"Byzantium's" appeal is not so much its bite, which could use some refining, but the emotional journey its undead take. In Jordan's hands, the vampires are so very human.__This feels tired as storytelling despite some evocative imagery and typically lush camerawork.__Again and again, as the story shifts between women, times and moods, Mr. Jordan adds a punctuating flourish ... that exquisitely illustrates the once-upon-a-time mood.__Unfortunately, the story never grabs hold as insistently as Jordan's tone and visual artistry.__Despite multiple graphic beheadings and literal waterfalls of blood, the film generates a shockingly small amount of horror.__Lyrical, full of visually enthralling fantasy sequences punctuated by moments of intense, bloody violence ...__"Byzantium" comes late to the vampire game hoping to restore a little decorum, but winds up looking decayed.__Jordan, a master of mood, creates an unsettling atmosphere of small-town despair, and the film's sporadic spikes of violence ... are often inventive.
Something in the Air is a splendid title for a one-of-a-kind film -- a political mood movie that's more revelatory and exciting than almost any political melodrama.__A wispy picture, likeable certainly but lacking in crispness and clarity.__Assayas captures a season in the lives of a group that envisioned themselves as bearers of truth ...__Free of nostalgia and not overly critical in hindsight, it captures the immediacy of youth in hugely endearing fashion.__Every kid believes the world around him is changing in ways it hasn't before; for these kids, it really was. Or had.__The pretty actors and counterculture nostalgia kept reminding me of Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers. This is a much better film, infused with Assayas's characteristic love for the freshness of nature and the eagerness of youth.__Worth seeing for what it says of the turbulent state of France in the early 1970s, when Mr. Assayas was a high-school student in Paris ...__A clear-eyed - if largely plot-free - memory play from writer-director Olivier Assayas, whose previous films have veered from the bizarre ("Demonlover," "Boarding Gate") to the poignant ("Summer Hours").__Depending on your tolerance for nostalgia, "Something in the Air" is either a bracing flashback to the 1970s wave of student radical fervor or a lengthy ride with some singularly self-righteous and naive troublemakers.__Fans of Assayas's "Cold Water" and "Summer Hours" will appreciate the fluid camerawork that snakes from room to room in some of the most seductive adolescent party scenes ever committed to film.__The whole film, though it kicks off with a riot and a firebombing, soon acquires a listless and guttering air ...__Assayas doesn't bring out the fiery best in this material, but he's smart enough to know that revolutionaries like their comforts as much as the ruling class does.__In creating a mashup of a Paris rocked by political storms and a young man in just as much turmoil, the director has given us a glimpse of an imperfect moment and an imperfect life in a slightly imperfect but wonderful film.__It does capture the high emotionalism of a very specific point in a person's life, where the magnitude of the injustices around you is surpassed only by the firm belief that you and your friends alone know an easy way to end them.__[It] has the aroma of an autobiographical confession by someone for whom life hasn't been overly difficult.__Mr. Assayas's method is observant and immersive. His camera moves among young bodies like an invisible friend, and his somewhat messy narrative is propelled by fidelity to feeling rather than by the machinery of plot.__It's a terrific film, wonderfully atmospheric and alive ...__Viewers who didn't live through the period may not find them evocative. But this movie is about the choices that turn children into adults, and the attempt to balance conflicting enthusiasms.__Assayas looks back on youth with both the generous affection and wry clarity of adulthood.__The film often plays like a nostalgic doodle, gliding aimlessly from one classic-rock-scored encounter to another. But then, that meandering quality is part of the appeal ...
A family implodes with a biting commentary on patriarchy.__"We Are What We Are" is such a patient, trusting film it may take you a while to figure out it's a horror film.__We Are What We Are doesn't waste time with cheap scares. Mickle keeps his story on a steady, slow simmer, transporting us minute by minute into the very heart of dread.__There's some fun to be had, as long as your idea of fun includes being grossed out.__The movie stays elegantly restrained just long enough for the true horror of what they're doing to sink in.__A campy and sometimes elegant American Gothic horror story.__The original was nothing special, but at least it had a sense of humor and a modicum of social insight.__The movie saves most of its modest number of jolts for its last quarter or so, which makes them all the more intense. They stick in your craw - and be warned, they're not for the squeamish.__"We Are What We Are" is a first-rate example of good storytelling and well-timed - while not excessive - gore.__Mickle never seems in a hurry, so there is time to take note of the detail. "We Are" is rich in that regard.__It's all a little silly, but Mr. Mickle's restrained gravity stifles the impulse to laugh.__At 72, Parks turns in one of the most tender performances of his career - before reminding us, in the end, that he's still a guy who can sit across a table and make you tremble in fear with a stony gaze.__A [horror] film where ambiance, glossy imagery and performance are more effective than the splatter.__Plays less like a contemporary horror film than an increasingly gruesome drama, building to a climax-completely original to this version-where the movie's core themes are expressed through grotesque imagery.__It's a sinister, wistful and even sad portrait of one family that has followed the insanity and bloodthirstiness of American history into a dark corridor with no exit.__Outside of its cracked psychology (well conveyed by papa Bill Sage), We Are What We Are is horror leftovers, neither inedible nor piping hot.__It isn't until the ending, which turns the squirm amplifier up to 11 and exceeded even my horrific expectations, that we finally see the story's potential realized.__One of the best American horror films of the year.__We Are What We Are is a re-make that succeeds superbly while remaining true to the strange and sad intimately grotesque spirit of the original.__Genre buffs will dig in with gusto.
Perfectly adequate airplane reading.__The story, while unsurprising, is also quietly satisfying. Everyone comes to accept some hard truths about themselves.__Cliched literary trappings come together in "Stuck in Love," but the final product feels more like a footnote than a finished work.__Although "Stuck in Love" is an indie film, it hews slavishly to Hollywood formulas right down to its comfy Thanksgiving Day ending. It's all so easy, isn't it?__Just like most romantic comedies (though this is more of a "rom-dram"), Stuck In Love. believes nothing is worthier than refusing to give up after you've been rebuffed in no uncertain terms.__Worthwhile for its fine performances, including the best work that Greg Kinnear and Jennifer Connelly have done in quite a while.__Writer-director Josh Boone populates Stuck in Love with smart characters breaking from emotional holding patterns of varying contours.__The movie's not especially urgent or inventive, but it has small moments of grace ...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
This biopic is part hagiography, part expose, and gravely incoherent.__It would have benefited the film if Roodt had been as bold with the mechanics of his storytelling as he is with his inclusion of the title character's less savory moments. But its strengths, particularly the two lead performances, far outweigh its flaws.__"Winnie Mandela'' really stumbles when it comes to depicting the couple's painful separation, which the film suggests resulted more from politics than Winnie's infidelity.__Despite the marquee names and their obvious talent, the film feels like a made-for-TV movie.__Distant and obvious, it takes a story with many angles and reduces its edges, becoming a glorified TV movie.__Winnie Mandela is a simplistic look at a complex figure.__Ms. Hudson's frequent and distracting costume changes are a sign of deeper problems in a movie that wants to be all things to all people, especially women.__From the swelling melody on the soundtrack that opens the film to the Wind Beneath My Wings-like ballad that closes it, Winnie Mandela ... feels less like history come alive than Hollywood hagiography at its most blandly sentimental.__Like many a biopic before it, "Winnie Mandela" shoehorns an exceptional life into the standard template of a highlights reel, lurching from one Important Moment to the next.__TV-style biopic reduces South Africa's struggle to the status of an impediment in the blooming romance between Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie.__Winnie Mandela is maybe the closest a movie has come to a series of commemorative plates.__By the film's end, Winnie has become so stifled by her own fallen stature that she sits frozen; unfortunately, so does this somewhat confusing movie.__What starts as a standard worshipful biopic of Winnie Mandela (Jennifer Hudson) suddenly shifts gears after her release from a year-plus jail stint.__A story that probably could have been told better as a miniseries, the film's main strength is its performances.__Winnie begins as hagiography and ends in hellish confusion.__It won't satisfy history students curious about this polarizing figure, nor fans of its star, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson.__This one-dimensional biopic reduces important 20th century political figures to cardboard cutouts.__None__None__None
Eye-popping photography should draw viewers to this thoughtful, revealing doc.__Summer's blitz of apocalypse movies has nothing on this bee doc.__Oblique narrative aside, you can't beat the film's eye-popping visuals.__What's really frightening about Honey isn't what a hive of angry bees might do to us, but what we've done to them.__[Markus] Imhoof makes bees more important than they have previously seemed.__Imhoof's film is remarkable in its close-up photography. The bees loom large, like creatures from some mutant planet; dangle together in a delicate chain; and fill the air, floating like unusually vivid dust specks.__"More Than Honey" may be the most visually beautiful documentary ever made.__Markus Imhoof's inventive and powerful documentary ...__Most striking in "Honey" are closeups of the bees in their hives, symbiotically working together in creating their new queen: Imhoof rightfully spends time detailing the extraordinary nature of bee social structure.__Without any preachiness, this magically beautiful film urges us to take better care of the bees, and honor the irreplaceable things that they do for us.__An amiably shaggy combination of science lesson, whimsical musing and alarm bell ...__As a nature doc, More Than Honey rivals such acclaimed forebears as Winged Migration and Microcosmos, though it's working with a more limited scope, visually-if you've seen one honeybee, you've seen 'em all.__A fascinating but rambling documentary about the decimation of the world's bee population through the phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder.__Although the unexplained collapse of honeybee colonies is a global problem, the most startling moments in Markus Imhoof's documentary take place on a microscopic level.__It's a delightful, informative, and suitably contemplative study of the bee world and the bee-population crisis, though in the end it does offer enough dewdrops of hope to fill up a bluebell or two.__None__None__None__None__None
Heavy stuff but highly rewarding, and an illuminating look into a country still steeped in its brutal past.__Yes, this could happen anywhere, but you get the feeling it happens often in Russia. The only real hope here is that a movie this hard on the motherland could be made there.__"Leviathan" plays like downer Tolstoy, masterfully specific to these people and unforgivingly allegorical toward the country at large.__A story of political and spiritual corruption, of men and women accustomed to power, and of others fighting against it.__At times the movie suggests a Cheech and Chong comedy with cannabis replaced by vodka.__An observant and skillfully crafted film about corruption in modern-day Russia.__Enormously captivating, a study of oppression, human nature and the effect of the two things upon each other.__This is a portrait of people living under constant duress, trying to drown their sorrows in a bottle and sometimes behaving in misguided ways that will free them, if only temporarily, from their grim reality.__Call it what you like - a modern Russian epic, a crime drama, a black comedy or a scream in the dark - Leviathan is a shaggy masterpiece.__Andrey Zvyagintsev's Oscar-nominated and vodka-soaked satire of modern Russia, which plays more like tragedy.__As harshly beautiful as the Barents Sea coastline where it is set, this parable inspired in part by the biblical tale of Job dumps more misfortune than one hapless man should ever have to endure.__From its chamber-piece delicacy and bureaucratic detail to a grandeur and implacable pessimism that seem as ancient as the land itself, "Leviathan" is a distinctly Russian tragedy.__This is quite a movie, a bitter and compassionate work of genius that will reward repeat viewings and keep on getting better.__The masterful script deals with telling words.__As in their previous feature, Elena, Zvyagintsev and cowriter Oleg Negin modulate their social critique with sharp, ironic humor.__It's a small story set in a memorably desolate location. The actors, all quite magnificent, enlarge it ...__Nothing will surprise Zvyagintsev fans more than discovering how funny the film is, as the helmer and co-writer Oleg Negin extend the darkly satirical streak they began with Elena.__Andrei Zvyagintsev's fourth feature is a thriller, a black social comedy, and a thinly veiled swipe at Putin's regime in one tidy package.__'Leviathan' is structured as an intimate suspense story, with a Job-like hero on whom all sorts of hell will be visited by an uncaring state.__For all his failings, Kolya, in the movie's terms, is a natural man, and so his fate in fighting his implacable enemies in the state has a mythic resonance. The movie would not be as powerful as it is if he were haloed.
There is no flair, no suspense, not one frame composed with more in mind than getting a Beavis-type to chortle, "Cool."__As bloodbaths go, this one has some interesting angles. Not THAT interesting, but ...__The expectations raised by the first 20 minutes ... make it all the more disappointing when incoherent slaughter replaces soul-chilling dread.__"No One Lives" is a cheap horror prank that's ultimately not clever or accomplished enough to sustain its eccentricities, and they are very bloody eccentricities indeed.__There's so much darkness here, it's hard to see anything - literally. Forget the horror and mayhem. Someone needed to turn on the lights.__Most fatally, No One Lives neglects to provide a rooting interest. Great horror movies engender sympathy for the lambs being led to the slaughter.__Director Ryuhei Kitamura (The Midnight Meat Train) is too talented for material this retro-junky, but he and screenwriter David Cohen keep the action coming hard and fast ...__There's a certain pleasure to be had in such unabashed cinematic ineptitude, of course, though it would be wise to wait until you have your Netflix streaming remote in one hand and a freshly filled bong in the other.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
It's clear that Garrone is lamenting the death of culture. But the movie is more compassionate than screed-y. It's a portrait of the preoccupation with fame in an age in which in fame is cheap.__The satire here is finespun, and the film's conclusions ambiguous.__A dark allegorical comedy about the nature of fame, about obsession, about madness - and the point where they converge: on Big Brother, a TV show watched by millions.__For all its ups and downs and occasional detours into boorishness, it's an original that will surprise if not necessarily delight fans of Garrone's very different crime drama, "Gomorrah."__Matteo Garrone follows his crime epic Gomorrah with a comedy about reality TV, and though it hardly rivals the earlier movie in its social complexity, it still offers the spectacle of a vibrant and vividly realized Neapolitan neighborhood.__As cautionary tales go, this one's ripely knowing, and it speaks in a lot more languages than Italian.__Garrone has a feeling for sweep and color, and he makes Luciano a pathetic victim of the unrealities with which TV can beset us.__The opening shot guides us into the absurd merriment of a wedding party, while the ending is lit with a mystifying sense of wonder.__Garrone doesn't make the mistake of turning his protagonist, Luciano (Aniello Arena), into a bland Everyman.

You may or may not be convinced, but you will be affected.__"After Tiller" does viewers the great service of providing light where there's usually only heat, giving a human face and heart to what previously might have been an abstract issue or quickly scanned news item.__What makes this well-edited film compelling are the stories of the patients and the agonizing moral quandaries that the doctors express in doing their work.__It's a calm, thoughtful film about an incendiary subject, and it has a clear point of view: to allow these doctors (and some of their patients, who we hear but don't see) to explain why they do what they do.__Any viewer with an interest in this issue, whether pro-life, pro-choice or agnostic, ought to see this heart-piercing report from the front lines.__This wrenching documentary, profiling the four doctors who still provide third-trimester abortions in the U.S., is remarkable for being so level-headed.__The movie takes a calm and intellectual approach to an inflammatory subject, elevating what could have easily come off as propaganda into a reasoned and thoughtful work of journalism.__It's humanizing and heartbreaking.__The film is a welcome exploration of practical and philosophical matters seldom broached across the partisan divide.__After Tiller takes a compassionate look at a highly impassioned situation.__A surprisingly warm abortion documentary that restores the human element to an irreducibly human dilemma.__"After Tiller" takes the politically divisive, emotionally charged issue of late-term abortions and portrays it with grace, understatement and humanity.__"After Tiller" is groundbreaking in giving voice not only to the doctors, but to those who always seem to get overlooked in the high-volume political debate about this topic: the women themselves.__"After Tiller" is impressive because it honestly presents the views of supporters of legal abortion, and is thus a valuable contribution to a public argument that is unlikely to end anytime soon.__After Tiller is an hour and a half of folks on their best behavior, presented as a candid portrait.__Hard-nosed advocacy segues into lefty-evangelizing treacle as a cloying score accompanies a number of dewy scenes better suited to a maudlin Oprah Winfrey special.__The film is warm and scrupulous, like a sunny women's clinic.__None__None__None
Bold and varied animation sequences lift this into the stratosphere before it falls back into Nance's obsessively layered narrative; the resulting film is both beautiful and disorienting (just like love).__While the movie doesn't paint a clear sense of Nance's emotional side, one thing is certain: He is an artist with creativity to spare.

It may be hard for a viewer to accept some of the paranormal goings-on in War Witch -- the ghosts, the superstitions, the otherworldly powers -- but they're nothing compared to the realities that Komona has to endure.__Atrocity and beauty somehow co-exist in War Witch.__War Witch gives us a continent's tragedy in a young girl's face.__Nguyen brings the harshness of this world alive not with big dramatic flourishes but with an everyday tone that makes it all the more frightening. This is how it is - how else would it be?__Canadian writer-director Kim Nguyen spent nearly a decade researching this docudrama about child soldiers in Africa, and the film feels as authoritative as a first-hand account.__A haunting take on unspeakably grim subject matter, shot on location in the Democratic Republic of Congo.__A powerful and upsetting portrait of a young girl compelled into unimaginably horrific circumstances.__Nguyen, astonishingly, manages to wring something vaguely like a happy ending from this tragic story.__War Witch is most effective not when we are looking in on Komona but when we are inside her head.__The powerful things we expect from "War Witch" are as advertised, but what we don't expect is even better.__This intense, gripping drama is utterly transporting.__Brutality and tenderness are a potent mix in "War Witch."__The movie is committed to revealing the world through Komona's eyes, and you never feel a taint of voyeurism or condescension. It stays true to her.__War Witch is a remarkably mature portrait that trusts its audience to have their own reactions to its material; it doesn't yank at the heartstrings so much as expertly tune them.__It's depressing stuff, to be sure, but it does a marvelous job at giving us an impressionistic taste of horrific circumstances without using them to beat us into submission.__Nguyen's matter-of-fact storytelling proves to be the right match for a life of extraordinary suffering.__The film's subject is almost too horrible to contemplate, but it finds a way to space out the blows without softening them.__The sensitively imagined story of a child soldier in Africa makes War Witch a genre benchmark and a breakout work for writer-director Kim Nguyen.__Along with the moral lesson, Nguyen remembers to give auds some pleasures, including the exquisitely chosen soundtrack of African folk and pop music, Nicolas Bolduc's cinematography and the very artful use of sound throughout.__Rebelle is full of such careful detail, and is carried so beautifully by Mwanza's performance, that questions of authenticity slide away.
John Sayles is too talented, too authentic and too original to make a flat-out bad movie, but he flirts with it in "Go for Sisters."__This buddy/road film builds tension with its missing person quest in a border-crossing underworld.__A sci-fi-horror yarn stocked with a winning cast but hobbled by a lamebrained script and dull set pieces.__Once Olmos joins the proceedings, "Go For Sisters" begins to resemble a banal prime-time cop show.__Reminds us that you can give characters guns and tense face-offs without creating brain-dead action trash.__Few male writer-directors have explored female characters more ardently than John Sayles (Passion Fish, Sunshine State, Casa de los Babys), and this leisurely mystery features some of his best.__For a good while, writer-director John Sayles tricks you into thinking Go for Sisters is a crime thriller. But the movie turns out to be something different.__What could have been a south-of-the-border thriller becomes a riskier, more daring emotional drama.__Though fitfully entertaining, it lacks the conviction and urgency present in even the weakest of his quasi agit-prop productions.__The actors' unforced chemistry defies the artifice. Olmos' delectable hamminess and Hamilton's unfussy performance convey volumes. Ross, guarded and resilient, is a revelation.__The deeper the plot takes us into a criminal underworld, the more Sayles grasps at plot points and appears plain bored.__It's a deftly scripted parade of low-key character studies; just don't expect too much from the plot, which feels like an afterthought.__There aren't many thrills here. The detective work is desultory, we're told rather than shown many of the details, and the story both drags on and ends abruptly.__As long as "Go for Sisters" is focused on its characters, it remains on firm ground. But the flimsy detective story draped over them is underdeveloped and too sluggishly paced to take hold.__With the help of Hamilton, Ross and Olmos, sublime actors who radiate grit and grace, Sayles has made Go for Sisters a movie that stays inside your head long after you see it. It's a keeper.__The mechanical plotting fades into the background as the personal connections become increasingly compelling.__Overlong, style-less, and dramatically undercooked.__When the film's second act begins to slide into predictability, there's just enough of a foundation to carry the plot across the finish line.__Despite the class-conscious genre pleasures, independent cinema's foremost Zinn master feels slightly off his game.__[The characters are] well written and performed, but too wearied by their lives to invest much of themselves in connecting with each other - or to us.
The film is a compelling tribute to a remarkable achievement, and to a young woman who is, in her own words, "pretty bad-ass."__At best this functions as a pleasant aquatic travelogue; at worst it validates a teenage girl's egotism.__Maidentrip is full of sunsets and dolphins but short on introspection and drama.__Before our eyes, Laura's lengthening limbs and deepening introspection become the point of a movie that begins with a child and ends with a young woman.__What the film lacks in plot twists it makes up for in sheer amazement, such as one scene in which Dekker, in green night-vision, sways to Kool & the Gang's "Celebration" while closing in on the equator in her 40-foot vessel, Guppy.__Imagine if All is Lost were a great documentary starring Jennifer Lawrence.__"Maidenstrip" is a clear-eyed chronicle of Dekker's record-breaking voyage. Think "All Is Lost," but real, and with a teenage girl instead of Robert Redford (plus a very different ending).__There's plenty of triumph in this quest, but also an equally potent dose of coming-of-age melancholy.__Schlesinger seems in such a rush to guide us to the end unscathed that she sometimes loses sight of the small details that make this journey unique.__If it at times, the movie ends up communicating the boredom of such an isolated endeavour, that's necessarily a criticism.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

But they're frequently engaging, entertaining and stimulating.__Though [Zizek's] lecture exceeds two hours, he and director Sophie Fiennes incorporate enough deadpan comedy and clips from famous films to sustain the rhetoric.__In essence, the film is a lecture, but Zizek's associative thinking and understanding of the applicability of psychoanalysis makes it a lecture like no other.__It's exhilarating, even exhausting stuff, though Fiennes lightens the weight of iek's dense discourse with a welcome scattering of sight gags.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Like so many campaigning docs this is much more interested in throwing darts at the other guys than giving us a balanced film.__Intelligent, possibly important, definitely counterintuitive -- but needs more reporting and context.__The film's tone is boosterish, and the cursory treatment of the cost of a nuclear-based energy overhaul, or the viability of renewable energy, tends to arouse skepticism rather than allay it.__There's not much in the way of balance in this often bone-dry documentary about the bum rap nuclear power has gotten thanks to misinformed, if well-meaning, environmentalists and energy experts.__Documenting how five authors changed from anti- to pro-nuke energy stances, Stone is less persuasive at translating this logic into reality.__In the end, its somewhat equivocal message - that nuclear power might just be the lesser of several evils - is more convincing than you'd think.__Like many advocacy documentaries, it offers a one-sided argument. This time, however, it's advanced by people who spent much of their lives on the opposite side.__Its marshaling of the facts is one-sided, leaving many questions, and considerable scientific evidence, unexplored.__The pro-nuclear left grabs the bullhorn in this lively advocacy documentary.__The lack of opposing voices diminishes the film, even as Stone raises issues that shouldn't be discounted out of hand.__Robert Stone's documentary contends that the only feasible answer is nuclear power.__Perfunctorily assembled, Pandora's Promise is essentially a pamphlet in motion whose goal is to prompt a larger discussion. But it offers plenty to discuss, and that isn't bad.__Without telling us about the producers or introducing us to more sources, it can't contribute enough to an honest debate.__You need to make an argument. A parade of like-minded nuclear-power advocates who assure us that everything will be all right just doesn't cut it.__Alas, its argument against fear-driven orthodoxy is undercut by the fact that, as with so many of this subgenre's entrants, there are no substantial competing voices included in the mix ...__In its attempts to debunk the feasibility of massive energy reduction, Pandora's Promise at least brings some measure of rhetorical skill to its arguments.__Most issue docs are propaganda, and Robert Stone's latest is a formidable sales pitch for nukes, yet the film's points are well reasoned and urgent.__None__None__None
Director Jason Osder's grieving account of the deadly police assault on the MOVE collective's fortified Philadelphia row house works small, continuous miracles with a variety of existing footage.__Jason Osder's stunning debut documentary offers a disturbing look at a forgotten tragedy.__[Osder] cuts between news footage of the events as they unfurled and testimony from hearings held afterward to create a stark, nonjudgmental portrait of an incident that probably needn't have happened.__"Let the Fire Burn" offers a searing picture of how dumb and dangerous humans can be.__It's scary as both a movie and a still-reverberating moment in time.__Brilliantly edited, the film moves back and forth in time, first tracking the events leading up to the confrontation through news reports of the day.__A unique and disturbing work, Jason Osder's documentary "Let the Fire Burn" uses only archival footage to tell the story of a terrible day in a Philadelphia neighborhood 28 years ago.__Eschews talking-heads tradition in its potent examination of the 1985 Philadelphia police firebombing of a radical group known as MOVE.__Osder creates both intensity and intimacy, inviting viewers simply to watch and listen as a tragedy - born of unchecked aggression, incoherent ideology and appallingly faulty logic - unfolds.__Piecing the components together, and only sparingly deploying intertitle cards for clarity, Let the Fire Burn brings this 28-year-old tragedy front and center again - vividly, viscerally.__Uses no narrators, talking heads or fancy graphics to tell its devastating story. It doesn't need to.__Eloquent, even-handed, and meticulously constructed ...__It earns its considerable impact by telling an unnerving story and leaving it, in ways both daring and effective, fundamentally unresolved.__Jason Osder's gripping documentary revisits the notorious 1985 police raid against the black liberation group MOVE in west Philadelphia.__[A] lean and deeply unsettling archival-footage documentary.__Let the Fire Burn offers an even-handed depiction of the racial conflict that led to the conflagration on Osage Avenue.__The pure-archive approach leaves a taste of despair; civic governance, it seems, can't even promise not to kill you.__Jason Osder's riveting documentary chronicles the escalating confrontations between the Philadelphia police and the radical group Move.__Seamlessly fashioned from television news footage, public hearings and other sources, the movie relives an incredible chapter in American history.__A first-rate piece of forensic filmmaking.
My Lucky Star is wholesome, effortless entertainment that runs smoothly enough but seldom takes one's breath away in the romance department.__After watching it, you may need a few moments to remember which decade this is, because the film has the tone and silliness of a "Pink Panther" movie or an episode of the 1960s sitcom "Get Smart."__It's hardly original, but as the plot bounces from Singapore to Hong Kong and the lavishly gaudy Venetian Resort in Macao, "My Lucky Star" plays out like a sparkling, brightly lit travelogue with Zhang as a bubbly tour guide.__While Zhang is one of China's greatest international stars, "My Lucky Star" is utterly provincial.__While the film does not lack production values and panache, Gordon's direction often seems thoughtless.__The movie displays a fair amount of visual invention in its sight gags, stunt choreography, and bright color schemes.__Being successful involves knowing that light doesn't equal stupid, and discerning between formula and formulaic.

Watching Dessay work as a real human being and not a glittering vocal princess is a fascinating treat.__The movie is most enjoyable as a simple record of the performers, allowing one to eavesdrop on soprano Natalie Dessay and tenor Charles Castronovo as opera director Jean-Francois Sivadier coaches them through some of the libretto's more layered moments.__You can follow the story even if you're unfamiliar with the opera - though a five-minute brush-up on the plot wouldn't hurt.__Zeroing in on the art of rehearsal, "Becoming Traviata" is an exquisitely observed look at performance and the creative process.__Sivadier and Dessay take the familiar and make it tragic once more.__Doc offers impressive singing and insights into opera's nonmusical dramatic challenges.__A treat for fans of opera, the performing arts and documentaries about process.__[It] may not be fully satisfying as a documentary. But it has what any good movie needs: a star - the ever-game soprano Natalie Dessay.__Time with Dessay is worth treasuring, even when she's not singing.__Those unfamiliar with Verdi's tragedy won't understand why this production was significant, nor see much of the fruits of such hard work ...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
It's not a perfect blend, but Ben Wheatley's film is different enough - on second thought, let's just call it what it is: weird - to warrant your attention. Your admiration, even.__A British black comedy made in the spirit of "let's run with this demented premise till the tank is empty."__It's just not quite funny enough.__With a wink and a shrug, Sightseers shows us evil in all its banality.__A brilliant, deliciously wicked, and thoroughly enjoyable road film ...__Darkly funny as it is, the movie has undercurrents of genuine and very British weirdness.__The best way to appreciate this briskly paced sick joke is to view its multiple fatalities as especially pointed examples of slapstick.__Wheatley is strikingly effective in his manipulation of tone, establishing a queasy intimacy that only intensifies as the movie progresses.__What begins as an alert and witty barbed satire degenerates into a senseless bloodbath in the black comedy "Sightseers."__If you are in the mood for a bizarre tale of how to rid the British countryside of some of society's modern ills - litterbugs beware - "Sightseers" should do the trick.__Working from a script by Ms. Lowe and Mr. Oram, Mr. Wheatley continues in the same bludgeoning, amusingly if dubiously deadpan fashion for what soon feels like an overextended joke.__It may be the satirist's credo to spare no one, but in Sightseers, no one is spared Wheatley's smug superiority.__Sightseers is a jet-black comedy that understands exactly how absurdist it is, and its murders are always played for laughs-aided by their gruesome depictions.__The film proceeds with a lazy, sketch-like feel that makes more sense after considering that these characters began on stage; the material was reconceived as a movie after a TV pilot failed to ignite.__Lowe and Oram have been living with these characters for years, and it shows. The acting is very funny and well-observed.__A morose, unsettling blend of pathology for sport and murder for laughs.__A sick gag of a film that's bound to scar only the irony-challenged.__Lowe and Oram get along with wonderfully neurotic chemistry, making it easy to root for them in spite of their newfound bloodlust.__...Merciless and unforgiving at every turn, thoroughly British, creepy and beautiful even in the gloriously demented details.__Very British blend of quirky character-comedy and homicidal violence has all the makings of a midnight-movie cult classic.
It feels selectively edited toward a predetermined point of view.__[Plods] from one performance to the next with unnecessary asides for veteran Journey members to talk about their own lives (trivia of interest to megafans and no one else).__As infectious as Pineda's enthusiasm is, "Don't Stop Believin' " too often relies on his inherent appeal as a film subject, rarely probing more deeply than the narrative he and his bandmates provide.__Ms. Diaz settles for a flabby, repetitive showcase for the songs and an attaboy for their newest singer.__Pineda's ebullience is infectious, and "Don't Stop Believin': Everyman's Journey" is a pleasant story of dreams coming true.__Diaz insists on selling Pineda's promo-friendly myth at the expense of the richer, more complicated story of a dreamer who learns to become the durable professional his bandmates expect.__Though Perry probably wanted nothing to do with her project, his participation might have pushed this glimpse at the band's evolution into a genuine revelation.__This uplifting rock doc will provide inspiration to countless karoake singers.__Diaz ... emphasizes the uplifting aspects of Pineda's Journey experience, describing how he came from poverty and delinquency, before he dedicated himself to his craft, caught a lucky break, and became an inspiration to struggling nobodies everywhere.__The best material in the film is the loosest, capturing the perpetually insecure and overcompensating Pineda in his early concerts, leaping, bouncing, careening around as if every moment in every song were an audition for the next moment in the next song.__Pineda is a great subject, and it's obvious he's the biggest fan of the man who co-wrote and sang most of his current repertoire.__Well-chronicled and fascinating, Don't Stop Believin' is a cinematic journey well worth taking.__Unfortunately for this rock doc, this fan-to-frontman saga is not that interesting a turn.__It's a moving tale made more so because even after he's "won," Pineda maintains a clear-eyed pragmatism about what living a fairy tale costs.__It's nice to watch the members marvel unendingly over their new find, while Pineda himself presents an ideal image of gratitude and hard work.__None__None__None__None__None

The humour may not be wickedly black, but once in a while it's amusingly beige.__You certainly wouldn't want to spend your last moments with this bunch, but a couple of hours watching them is enjoyable enough.__You need better dialogue than Berger supplies to help It's a Disaster make a liar out of its title.__The movie's funniest touches are quiet flashes of character, expertly timed and nimbly played by a deft ensemble. "It's a Disaster" is consistently funny, but you wince more often than you laugh out loud.__Berger never takes the camera more than a few yards outside the house, but that's fine; there's plenty going on inside, as characters carom off each other like billiard balls, slipping down pockets of misunderstanding and jealousy.__The movie elicits knowing smiles more than laughs, even as it reveals a boundless observational awareness about the beefs and slights that, for the small-minded, must feel like everyday Armageddons.__[A] practically laugh-free vanity comedy with C-listers facing the apocalypse in the form of a nerve-gas attack on Los Angeles.__An underbaked comedy about eight people facing their mortality.__For most of the way, it's clever and smartly proportioned, with the action confined to one well-exploited location and gags about love, the curdling of long-term friendships and petty social mores popping off everywhere.__Berger's got some clever ideas, but he does not push far in exploring them.

But the wonderfully sad, exhilarating ending proves this filmmaker knew exactly where he was headed the entire time.__Writer-director Kyle Patrick Alvarez blends pointed satire with gallows humor, much like Sedaris himself.__Alvarez rides a fine line with the Candide-esque nature of the story, pointing out the absurdities of the people that David meets along the way but never skirting the fact that wiseacre David has a lot to learn about the real world.__There are some who have complained that C.O.G. ends too abruptly, but it has the bracing, devastating punctuation of a fine short story.__The ace in the hole is Groff, who fluidly slides between lip-curled sarcasm and teary-eyed vulnerability-he's the embodiment of the thrill and terror of being a not-so-little boy lost.__What was very funny in print becomes serious and occasionally dour onscreen, with fewer laughs than you would expect from a Sedaris project.__The source material may be David Sedaris (this marks the first time the essayist has allowed one of his pieces to be adapted), but the tone couldn't be more Kyle Patrick Alvarez, who once again steers auds to some gloriously uncomfortable places.__Don't expect a rash of David Sedaris screen adaptations to be sparked by this bland effort.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
It hits all the expected beats of a thoroughly vanilla biopic as an aging Leonie reflects on her unconventional life via plodding voiceover while doddering through a forest collecting berries.__As a portrait of female strength and a celebration of the artistic spirit, "Leonie" too seldom comes fully alive.__Failing to carve anything graceful or fluid out of a slab of biography, helmer Hisako Matsui does bring to light a curious and intriguing story of a great-woman-behind-a-great-man in Leonie.__Lushly photographed and featuring a stellar performance by the luminous Emily Mortimer in the title role, Hisako Matsui's film is deeply heartfelt but only intermittently compelling.__Leonie Gilmour was almost certainly unusual and unusually self-reliant.

God Loves Uganda charts the rise in persecution and intolerance in the African nation as America's Christian right takes its anti-gay fight to new territory.__Watching this film will leave you with some dispiriting questions about America and its values.__You'd never guess the subject matter of "God Loves Uganda" from its innocuous-sounding title.__Williams' alarm is balanced by his measured observation of a group of twentysomethings from the Kansas City-based International House of Prayer.__Those who demand pure objectivity from their documentaries may stumble on God Loves Uganda, which never pretends to be impartial, probably because it's next to impossible to do so when tackling this topic.__"God Loves Uganda" approaches this intersection of faith and politics with some fairness and a good deal of outrage.__In the best documentary tradition, Williams allows these Christian missionaries and their leaders to speak for themselves, and there is no doubting their sincerity.__Kudos to the filmmakers for so adeptly laying out the history of American evangelicals' Ugandan mission, and for noting that HIV infection rates there have gone up since the abstinence-only education started.__[An] unsettling and well-crafted film.__On its own angry, preaching-to-the-secular-choir terms, Roger Ross Williams' forceful polemic succeeds to a startling degree.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
There are just so many ways Carine Roitfeld can say she loves fashion in "Mademoiselle C," a somewhat interesting documentary that brings us into the inner workings of a magazine, but harps a bit too much on her ideas of fashion and style.__Unfortunately, the film doesn't show its subject's creative process as much as that of her collaborators ...__For fashion junkies, Mademoiselle C will be like five September issues of Vogue all rolled into one.__As a distinctly not-insider ...

Seifert approaches the subject from the perspective of a concerned father of three youngsters and he comes across as earnest and well-intentioned.__While the movie rarely feels like the definitive, well-honed dissection this critical subject demands, [Seifert's] lighter approach keeps a somewhat arcane topic more easily digestible, dare say entertaining.__[Provides] a gentle, flyover alert to obliviously chowing-down citizens ... without hectoring and with no small amount of charm.__Why anyone would think that home movies of the director and his kids belong in a social-issues doc is a truly WTF question.__A documentary that is by turns exasperating, illuminating, and intentionally infuriating.__Combines the folksy charm of Taggart Siegel's The Real Dirt on Farmer John and the frightening facts of Robert Kenner's Food, Inc.__Insufferably certain of its own charm and a lot less interested in educating viewers than it purports to be, Jeremy Seifert's GMO OMG offers an introduction to genetically modified food that is only slightly more thoughtful than the movie's title.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

An Australian mystery-thriller dominated by Joel Edgerton's fearless performance as a compromised married man.__Joel Edgerton gives one of the year's strongest performances.__Wish You Were Here is an excellent idea for a State Department video, to remind travelers the obvious things not to do when visiting an unfamiliar country. As a drama, it feels a little empty.__The mysteries unravel at a steady pace and the dialogue and acting feel naturalistic, adding up to a taut and progressively tangled portrait of familial relations.__A dull drama about domestic squabbling that hopes to be mistaken for a thriller.__The time you spend trying to piece together a mystery that is presented as a teasing puzzle inevitably diverts you from deeper identification with characters who are not particularly sympathetic to begin with.__Even a drug-sniffing police dog gives a vivid performance.__Hypnotically watchable but badly flawed by a shrug of an ending.__If you do decide to travel abroad, this film offers some tips on how to stay safe and sane - that is, if you can extract them from the teasingly elliptical, flashback-addled, nerve-racking narrative.__Though much of the film is overcooked and overwrought, it's well-played, and writer-director Kieran Darcy-Smith keeps us guessing, and watching.__A pervasive mood of paranoia and unease overwhelms any immediate understanding of what's going on.

There's a winning confidence to the filmmaking, which is deceptively stylish - Dupieux favours nervy close-ups and blurred foregrounds - and some real soul in Plotnick's performance.__Dupieux makes the viewer work for it with Wrong.

This giant turkey was produced, written, and directed by Roman Coppola, who must have thought the dumb fantasy sequences, steeped in movieland imagery, would remind people of 8-1/2 (or, at the very least, Head).__The audience finds out just how long 84 minutes can be. The answer: really long.__Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the film is that it adequately depicts the narcissism of its star ...__A film is a terrible thing to waste.__The execution ... is perilously self-absorbed ...__A movie that doesn't really seem to have any reason to exist, other than maybe to give writer and director Roman Coppola and star Charlie Sheen something to do for a few weeks.__As Charles Swan seems to become more aware of his loneliness, Charlie Sheen seems to become more protective of his Charlie Sheen-ness.__The film reveals a depth and weight to the Charlie Sheen archetype that we haven't experienced before.__This isn't a despicable film or a lazy one; it's just a doodle, a glorified home movie by a filmmaker who no doubt has one hell of a Rolodex and a few favors to call in.__Sort of like Bob Fosse's "All That Jazz'' minus the music, the wit and the insight, not to mention Roy Scheider's brilliant performance.__A noodling indulgence that's alternately freewheeling and dead in the water.__At best it is a mildly diverting goof with a charmless lead performance. Its underlying misogyny leaves a sour taste.__Charles Swan might have have been successful if its sensibilities weren't so aligned with its constantly disappointing protagonist's.__From its puffed-up title to the way the cast playfully bows to us at the end, "Swan" is so eager to be a trippy comic lark that it ends up resembling a clown trying to fit through a pea-shooter.__Sitting through The Mind of Charles Swan III does not lead to a deeper understanding of Charlie Sheen. It does, however, demonstrate his compulsion for poor judgment and bad choices.__The film strangely takes it for granted that everyone adores Charlie Sheen, and is willing to extend affection to the unmistakably Charlie Sheen-like character he plays here.__Seriously, this is one of the strangest and most painful films in recent memory.__With neither the moral bite of satire nor a voluptuary surrender that really basks in shallowness, this is a vague, unsatisfying work.__A precious, arid thing, Glimpse arrives pinned to Styrofoam like a prize arthropod.__Swan is more of a doodle than a fully formed idea, though not necessarily less enjoyable for it, since it was clearly intended to be an undisciplined, anything-goes kinda story.

As much as it hopes to incite outrage and to stir a complacent body politic into action, [it] never quite rises to the level of urgency the subject requires.__A blistering attack on politicians, propagandists, dissemblers and other climate-change deniers.__The film's effectiveness largely stems from the flat-out lameness of the opposition arguments, the lack of scientific credentials of those making them, and the self-interest of their corporate bosses.__Filmmaker Craig Scott Rosebraugh seems to take a kind of perverse glee in hauling out the worst offenders among what he calls the climate change deniers for public shaming.__What's next, "Big Oil Is Full of Meanies"?__The film makes its case well.

A thoughtful, intelligent examination of the US war on drugs.__This zippy documentary by Matthew Cooke can't compare to Eugene Jarecki's tragic and masterful The House I Live In (2012).__Highly entertaining and informative look at the war on drugs, offers a tongue-in-cheek manual of how to become a cartel leader. But it's not just a glib exercise & confronts the implications of a drug policy that many would agree is a disaster.__Ultimately, the most frightening lesson the film teaches is just how dysfunctionally impervious to defeat the so-called war on drugs is ...__It often works, despite in-your-face graphics that occasionally do the job of resembling cheesy sales pitches a little too well.__"How to Make Money" is full of useful insights from people who know the drug trade well, including reformed dealers, ex-international smugglers, former cops, pundits, lawyers and government insiders.__Cooke doesn't aim for impartiality and the movie would have benefitted from a broader range of viewpoints. But his concept is impressively original, and he follows through with undeniable creativity.__The problem with Selling Drugs is it's often just a little too flip, without much time given to the downside of addiction and the millions of lives ruined by drug abuse.__Vital, cogent and impressive.__How to sell audiences a lecture: Disguise it as a mock-infomercial.__Mr. Cooke ... doesn't entirely pull off the tricky shift from the creative gambit that threatens to undermine the film's moral authority.__If all of this is meant to be a satirical, tongue-in-cheek way into examining the problem of drugs in America, the conceit doesn't work.__Despite its slick packaging and overtly facetious premise, director Matthew Cooke and producer Adrian Grenier's faux-educational documentary "How to Make Money Selling Drugs" packs a wallop.__It's a smart, funny, tough-minded film crammed with data and personal anecdotes ...__By being both glib and preachy, this highly stylized pic ends up being a tiresome buzzkill.__The entertaining doc is more serious than it seems but has little new to say.__An ambitious, creative attempt to talk in a single film about everything from the disparate treatment of black and white dealers to the influence of asset forfeiture on law enforcement strategies to the devastation of Mexico's drug war.__None__None__None
Reygadas' jagged, broken-logic drama lurches from fantasy to earthbound complications, though it is often hard to tell one from the other.__The result calls for a viewing as different as looking at a Vermeer against Rothko or de Kooning or multiple other modern painters.__Along with Bela Tarr and Terrence Malick, Carlos Reygadas is one of today's few genuinely religious filmmakers.__Moviegoers beholden to clean narrative may feel they need their own explanatory GPS and audio guide. But the richer reward lies in allowing oneself to be led by this gifted director's instinct for lyrical, sensory exploration.__This one delivers a grand pictorialism and piercing existential moments that float atop the maundering narrative like noodles in soup.__It's as if Reygadas started with a sprawling cache of visual ideas and then tried to find some way to organize them all. The effect can be frustrating at times, but also surprising and beguiling.__Like a jumbled-up set of nesting boxes, the scenes make sense individually (kind of). The hard part is fitting them together.__Regadas overdoes everything in a self-indulgent presentation of trite fantasies masked as memories.__The film is never less than fascinating, but it appears to be so intensely personal as to be all but indecipherable to viewers not personally acquainted with the filmmaker, or at least in possession of the press kit.__A mesmerizing combination of opaque art-house cinema, personal reflection and class-based rural thriller, Mexican director Carlos Reygadas' "Post Tenebras Lux" casts a strange and powerful spell.__Life and death, nature and culture, sex and money, man and beast, God and the Devil - "Post Tenebras Lux" embraces the world even if it doesn't open itself up to ready interpretation.__This is a movie that, even in its most inexplicable or provocative moments, welcomes each of us into its stream of subconsciousness as a fellow dreamer.__Confusion often reigns here, but the film offers a degree of lush beauty that makes sitting through it well worth the occasional frustrations.__"'Post Tenebras Lux' works so well because - even at its most random - it always feels like more of a single portrait of a man in crisis than it does an impish bouquet of provocative incidents."__Acclaimed Mexican auteur's self-indulgent exercise in exquisite pseudo-profundity commits hara-kiri on his own reputation.__The premise is realized with a sludgy, bombastic portentousness; the images, for all their strained rhapsody, show little, and merely recite a thesis.__Yet again, one senses that Reygadas - instead of simply getting on with the job of making a film - has opted instead to go for an opus magnum that reminds us of cinema's greats__The title, signifying "light after darkness," derives from the Latin translation of the Book of Job, an appropriate source given that a considerable amount of the prophet's proverbial patience is required.__None__None
Essentially a sports documentary with the look and feel of an ESPN program, "Rising from Ashes" nevertheless has broad, inspirational appeal on a human level.__This is an inspiring tale of a nation, and a man, not wanting to be judged by past misdeeds.__Engaging personalities and lively, good-looking assembly make T.C. Johnstone's inspirational sports docu a crowdpleaser.__This feel-good sports doc brings a little-known story to compelling life.__Ashes is joyous and uplifting, full of spirit, memorable athletes (including Olympian Adrien Niyonshuti) and remarkable achievements, both big and small.__Though the subject inspires, Johnstone's treatment lacks focus and edge, falling back on platitudes, sentiment, and generalities when clarity is what is needed.__The sincerity and simplicity of the film ... lift it somewhat above the ordinary run.__A film that lacks complex human dimension to fill out this likable if promotional tale of good will and achievement.__Its story line is as positive and affirmative as the title indicates, but it turns out there are dramas going on in this documentary that you wouldn't initially suspect.__Sports provide a path for redemption for both athletes and coaches in Rising From Ashes, a documentary whose power is diminished by uneven storytelling.__Rising from Ashes is not just about a cycling team; it's a testament to what happens when human beings care for one another.__The movie crafts genuine drama from a nail-biter of an Olympic-qualifying race and authentic pathos from footage of Rwandans watching the Games' opening ceremony on television.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
While it's a loving homage to movies like Dario Argento's Suspiria and is crafted with tons of style, it leaves out one key ingredient: being even remotely scary.__Radishes, cabbages and melons meet horrific ends in Berberian Sound Studio, a down-the-earhole psychodrama where what you hear is more terrifying than what you see.__Writer/director Peter Strickland intriguingly weaves into the story a movie-within-a-movie that we barely see, but we hear.__A sometimes interesting, sometimes head-scratching movie that pays homage to the old ways of the sound mixing world and to the "giallo" genre of horror that was prominent in Italy during the 1970s.__[It] not only exploits one of cinema's most important modes, it also attempts something more difficult: turning a genre movie into a work of art.__A one-trick pony, but it's a reasonably cool trick.__"Berberian Sound Studio" may be the finest tribute to the old-school cinematic craftsmanship of the sound mixer and Foley artist I've ever encountered.__Horror fiends looking for cheap thrills may be disappointed. But those with a flair for the offbeat might find themselves unnerved and riveted.__It accomplishes the tricky task of paying homage to one type of scary movie while indulging in an entirely different style itself.__[It's] as if someone took all the raw footage from Argento's "Suspiria," and gave it to Antonioni to recut.

Even for newcomers, there are minor chords to enjoy. If only there were less screaming.__Manages to evoke the crimson-splashed shockers of the 1970s without so much as a single frame of actual carnage.__A twisted tribute to analog moviemaking and 1970s Italian Giallo horror flicks.__Berberian Sound Studio may scan as a psychological thriller, but it's really a lavish gift to film geeks in a lovely matryoshka box.__The creepiness builds with symphonic precision until reality truly is indistinguishable from fantasy.__Mesmerizing, but the images stand alone and incomplete.
Seriously, if not always elegantly, the film portrays the great Ip Man as someone trying to survive, which is to say just as often a victim as a victor.__Soap opera, set-bound and unexceptionally written and directed.__The naturalism of Wong's performance is undercut ... by Yau's use of phony-looking sets, sterile CGI and flashy aerial shots.__The overall sense is of a rushed, simplistic installment in a well-worn biography franchise.__The Final Fight plays out like a collection of greatest-hits vignettes barely connected to one another.__A film that's less a kung-fu movie and more a meditation on kung fu's limitations.__Enjoyable enough, this colorfully local, nostalgia-tinged tale focuses on the Hong Kong years of an older, gentlemanly kung fu master.__What the pic lacks in stylistic sparks compared with other renditions by Wong Kar Wai and Wilson Yip, it makes up for in sinewy action and traditional values.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
More of a tribute than a hard-hitting piece of American filmmaking, which is too bad, because the subject - the imprisonment of ex-Black Panther figure Mumia Abu-Jamal - deserves a thorough, serious examination.__Director Stephen Vittoria lines up a roster of writers and educators, actors and activists, to sing Abu-Jamal's praise. And praise they do.__A film that would let us decide the pros and cons of his life for ourselves would certainly be welcome.__"Mumia" gradually becomes a persuasive attempt to celebrate the content of his character, not the violence that apparently led to his imprisonment.__Vittoria avoids discussing the crime for which Abu-Jamal spent 29 years in solitary confinement on death row, instead tracing the path of a brilliant journalist whose message cannot be silenced.__The doc is unapologetically one-sided, and spends more time canonizing Abu-Jamal than exploring the murder and trial themselves.__This film is certainly a bracing change from the usual back-and-forth of the evening news.__The case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the African-American journalist sentenced to die for a 1981 Philadelphia murder charge, gets a juicy, visual but inescapably tilted treatment here.__An obstructive, agitprop style detracts from the important, singularly American story buried in Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary ...__More hagiography than history.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
There's a strange heft to its hollowness.__"Big Sur" cracks the code of how to adapt Jack Kerouac for the screen.__Sometimes feels like a beautiful illustration, rather than an adaptation, of Kerouac's prose.__With Kerouac declaring that "the only thing that matters is the conceptions in my own mind," we're still left waiting for the filmmaker who can take us there.__Nobody's given the opportunity to do much more than brood prettily and occasionally shout carpe diembromides into the pounding surf.__Don't worry if you don't connect. There's nothing to connect to. The characters are never developed, and nothing ever happens.__A work that accurately expresses the awfulness of narcissistic self-destruction, and nothing else.__You don't have to be a Beat cultist to wonder why these brilliant and transgressive volcanoes of authentic cool are so friggin' boring.__Offers an elegantly muted take on the midlife ennui of Kerouac's autobiographical 1962 novel.__An intuitive approach to this literary classic yields dividends for both style and performance.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Look beyond the generic shell, and this wildly imperfect movie appears to have a rare soul lurking inside it.__Nothing in "Redemption" quite adds up, including the paranoid hero's insistence that he's being watched by drones.__Knight seems to want to say something, but it comes out pretty garbled.__A flawed but still solid debut. And another strong step forward for Jason Statham, the man who won't stay still.__"Redemption" doesn't have the chutzpah to let loose and be as dumb as it needs to be, so it instead bores the audience comatose with long stretches of sad-face Statham putzing around an apartment to justify the too-brief bursts of giddy bone-breaking.__Its narrative continuity is so sketchy and the screenplay so haphazard that the movie doesn't add up to more than trash, seasoned with pretentious religiosity.__Statham uses his steely watchfulness and grim demeanor to draw us in.

Despite its hints of New Age mysticism and serviceable performances from an able cast, Touchy Feely is too entrenched in its dour tone to be uplifting.__The actors are all first-rate and the performances are fascinating, though Shelton, who shuns exposition, makes you work to figure out the interrelationships.__There's something fresh and new here, something that wasn't so dominant in [Shelton's] previous work.__A work that gestures toward depths without truly plumbing them.__The kind of film that makes you wish they had perfected choose-your-own-adventure technology for movies, one that would allow you to ditch the central character and follow any number of the story's more interesting second bananas.__Shelton is more observant than she is deep, and her filmmaking can be undisciplined, but the movie's rambling, episodic rhythms do seem in tune with the nebulous stasis that infects everyone in Abby's orbit.__"Touchy Feely'' works better in its funnier moments, but Shelton - who pads things out with way too many scenic shots of Seattle - never pulls all these threads together into a satisfying whole.__"Touchy Feely" becomes disoriented and doesn't recover its direction.__Shelton's oh-so-slight veer toward whimsy and artifice this time turns her previous strengths into weaknesses.__Touchy Feely is minor, but these people are good company.__The screenplay is so muddled that it's hard to fathom what it's trying to convey, despite a twin dose of magical realism that screams "high concept."__Like her characters, Shelton doesn't know what to do when things actually happen.__Just as tedious as waiting in a dentist's office for an hour and a half, Lynn Shelton's latest fumblingly cutesy outing ought to be her last.__Shelton's latest is warm but less endearing than its predecessors.__Trading her improv-based filmmaking style for a more traditional screenplay-grounded model, Lynn Shelton delivers an uneven mix of half-formed conflicts in Touchy Feely.__None__None__None__None__None
"Far Out Isn't Far Enough" [has] a raconteur's charm rare among film studies of artists' lives.__Ungerer is a lively, articulate interview subject, acerbically funny about his run-ins with censors and anyone else who would hope to quash his colorful contradictions.__For the most part, Bernstein lets Ungerer, still impish in his 80s, do the talking.__In 1958, Ungerer's picture book "Crictor" featured an unlikely hero, a boa constrictor, and the usual anodyne pabulum served up to bored kids would no longer do.__As provocative as the art is - whether G-rated or R - the artist is even more interesting.

While Fung's attempts to err on the side of seriousness in this one after the stylized video-game high jinks of its predecessor are clearly purposeful, they don't necessarily make for a more pleasurable viewing experience.__There's less of the hyperventilated genre-pinging (video games, manga, comic books) from the first film. But there's still a nagging, cartoonish emptiness ...__"Tai Chi Hero" merely fills the eye, offering little that stays with you.__Purist fans of martial arts cinema probably won't embrace this film any more than its predecessor.__This sequel is sluggish and rote where its predecessor was aggressively perky and desperate to please.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"I Give It a Year" is a smart farce that would make Hugh Grant and his fans proud.__Mazer's previous onscreen experience is undeniably obvious. No penis is left unfilmed, no crude scene prevented from going on far too long.__In addition to some trite set pieces, writer-director Dan Mazer serves up nothing more than conspicuous cynicism masquerading as comedy.__The tonal clash is jarring, and Mazer doesn't help matters by erring on the side of blandness.__Can a comedy be too funny for its own good?__As pure comedy, it's a hoot.__A smutty script and a passel of objectionable characters form an imperfect rom-com union - one that will, with any luck, fade from the mind long before its title suggests.__Whatever attachment we might form for the characters or their fates gets lost in thickets of farce and barrages of one-liners.__It's rather close to excruciating.__"I Give It a Year" holds a special place in film history.

At the same time, you have to wonder who's going to watch it.__The movie, made by three former teenage fans of the show, is an odd mixture of admiration and repulsion; even his friends and former producers, interviewed for the camera, seemed mixed in their feelings for him.__Friends and former colleagues address the lingering question of whether Downey was being sincere or engaging in an elaborate form of performance art.

Simon Killer is a sensory, experiential film - more of a state of mind than a straightforward story.__Self-consciousness passing for style.__"Simon Killer" is a beautifully made look at ugliness and brutality, the kind of oxymoronic exercise that fascinates some and repels others.__Another terrific performance from Brady Corbet, but it's in the service of a parade of horrors that never leads anywhere interesting.__It is brutally raw and difficult watching.__The overall sense&#8232;of chilly disengagement becomes trying, and there's a last-minute switch that suggests that Campos is trying to have his croissant and eat it.__The film is frequently masterful, suggesting the turbulent inner state of an American sociopath who believes himself to be a good guy.__A noirish character study of a young American in Paris, "Simon Killer" chillingly combines the classic amoral drifter out of James M.

Alas, the film quickly loses its offbeat charm and devolves into a routine monster movie.__Appealing as that might sound to the walking-dead obsessed, this modest, low-budget sci-fi thriller is fatally lacking in entertainment value.__In the ways that "The Last Days on Mars" is like a horror movies, it's typical, and in the ways it's different, it's mostly flat.__"The Last Days on Mars" seems like it could deliver ... thought-provoking goods - at least until the plot devolves into Zombies in Outer Space.__[A] low-budget, highly predictable, but well-acted Red Planet thriller ...__The acting is convincing across the board, especially Schrieber's, despite being saddled with such dialogue inanities as saying "you're gonna be all right" to a crewmate who is zombifying before his very eyes.__Fails to live up to the awesomeness of its own campy premise.__Although this film presents an interesting cast, they never feel like a crew.__The Last Days on Mars ultimately confirms what science has already spent billions of dollars establishing: There's just no life here.__Lean, muscular and on the money, The Last Days on Mars takes a familiar story and tells it so tautly that we are pleased to be on board.__Once it turns into a horror movie, "The Last Days on Mars" loses its originality and becomes the usual us-against-them battle between the dead and the undead.__Had The Last Days on Mars had the sort of artistic ambitions that matched the level of its cast, or if it had fully committed to being a fun, trashy, sci-fi monster movie, it'd be a more interesting watch.__Ruairi Robinson's derivative thriller renders even alien zombification as airless as a vacuum-sealed space capsule.__Robinson's go-to style for action sequences is a frenetic whirlwind of quick cuts and random angles that makes Michael Bay look like Michael Powell.__Here's hoping Robinson adds a little more extra to the terrestrial next time around.__The first half plays out by the numbers, with undead astronauts popping open the fragile bubble protecting the crew, but there's some grandeur to the second ...__A murkily derivative sci-fi-horror entry that basically amounts to Red Planet of the Dead.__I had to wonder, could I be watching the next remarkably brainy piece of sci-fi, this year's Moon?

It also makes Our Nixon a uniquely dynamic time capsule.__After two hours, Nixon remains a riveting enigma.__A brisk, eye-opening documentary about the Nixon White House, this triumph of editing is composed of homemovies, accompanied by later TV interviews and priceless audio from the secret tapes, making it a must-see for anyone interested in Americana.__This highly personal view of the Nixon years is, for obvious reasons, a sad and wrenching one-a film that is nonetheless filled with spirit, humor and a bountiful sense of irony.
Golden-hued, feel-good treacle, the sort that the U.K. has tried to export ever since Billy Elliot.__The golden-hued cinematography (a filming cliche that really needs to be retired) and the sometimes slack direction by Marc Evans are minuses ...__At various moments this endearing but sudsy movie, which spills all over the place, evokes "High School Musical," "Glee" and "Billy Elliot."__Hunky Dory flits along blithely from number to transporting musical number until it ends - with a sigh - and dodges any authentic engagement with its own ideas.__Enthusiasm carries the day in this paint-by-numbers period tale, which is just charming enough to coast on its own cliches.__Director Marc Evans and screenwriter Laurence Coriat fumble both the musical side of their movie and the coming-of-age side.__Hunky Dory has some pleasant things in it, but unfortunately, the funereal pace makes a snail look like a jackrabbit.__When it's indulging in glammed-up musical sequences, Hunky Dory comes to life; everything else couldn't seem less inspiring.__Surprisingly, it's not bad.__Like a retro version of High School Musical with less charm.__Heartfelt interpretations of Seventies rock are only part of the appeal of nostalgia-drenched high school drama.__Driver delivers a characteristic combination of savvy and likeability and the period and sun-dappled photography are nicely handled.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
American Sniper has a perspective that's recognizable from the classic Westerns Eastwood has long been associated with, both as an actor and a director. It's an existential critique of violent machismo that doubles as a celebration of violence.__Eastwood makes the moral stakes almost nonexistent.__It speaks emotionally to audiences who sense that we lost something in Iraq, yet still want to honor the heroism of those who risked their lives for the cause, whether or not it was ultimately a great one.__Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is an often lazy and somewhat hazy propaganda film about American heroism and hell in the Iraq War.__Although Cooper succeeds in resembling and sounding like the real Kyle, this isn't some cheap impersonation trick. Cooper gives maybe the best performance of his career.__The 84-year-old's deep appreciation of the masculine -- its conflicts, its appeal, its evolving truths -- has added texture to our understanding of violence, warfare and more. At least as it is represented onscreen.__American Sniper romanticizes Kyle, whose bestselling memoir, which put him on talk-show appearances, included boastful stories of dubious authenticity. What remains is distilled and dramatized, a story of loss, the story of the universal soldier.__The fluidity and tension of the battle scenes is breathtaking, Eastwood at his cinematic best. But it's the ever-tightening knot inside of Kyle the director really wants to understand.__If American Sniper fails at being a truly great film, it is no fault of its star.__The film is, simply, a tragedy in which American certainty comes to grief against the rocks of the real world, and it views its central figure as a decent man doing indecent things for what he keeps telling himself is a greater good.__A movie that can't find a credible perspective on its subject, despite a winning performance from Bradley Cooper in the title role.__The melancholy streak coursing throughout the picture speaks to the grand tragedy of war and those who wage it on the ground, guns in hand and hearts in throat, unaware at the moment of how radically different the rest of their lives will be.__Young volunteers have been at war for 14 futile years, and the next Chris Kyle deserves to be understood.__"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown," Shakespeare wrote. But is that true when the coronet is no more than a backward ballcap balancing a pair of wraparound shades?__There's a difference between a film about a man reluctant to acknowledge the psychological toll of what he endured and a movie that basically doesn't want to talk about it or question it, or think about it, period.__A shrewd and very well-made picture.__"American Sniper," Eastwood's 37th film as a director, is his darkest, tightest and most morally ambiguous drama since he shot the western dead with "Unforgiven."__The message of American Sniper? There really isn't one, apart from Eastwood's career-long fascination with taciturn men called upon to do a dirty but necessary job well.__The movie reality created by Eastwood is powerful and intense, and "American Sniper" is arguably his best picture since "Unforgiven."__It is to Cooper's credit - and Eastwood's - that Kyle does not come off as a lunk-headed cartoon hero, but a man who, if he doesn't struggle with his choices in the moment, is gravely affected by their consequences.
A solid lead-up to the finale.__It's an elaborate game of hurry-up-and-wait. And it's the most shameless example yet of splitting the final book in a hugely popular series into two film adaptations.__Might it have been better if they'd squeezed the whole book into one movie? Probably. Nonetheless, Mockingjay Part 1 is a fine entertainment, shot through with moments of surprising emotional impact.__Mockingjay has more exposition than a TED Talk, more rubble than a decade of The Flintstones, and absolutely no nonmonetary reason to be Part 1 of anything. It isn't storytelling. It's a filibuster.__As an actress, Lawrence has grown beyond this sort of thing, and the entire enterprise, directed by Francis Lawrence, feels like a massive placeholder for the grand finale.__The effect of so many Oscar-calibre actors speaking the generic dialogue is like watching pro ballplayers play T-ball.__"Mockingjay - Part 1," however well done, can't compete with the first two films, although it sets up what should be its stunning ending well enough.__If Mockingjay - Part 1 is quieter and less flashy than its predecessors, that doesn't make it less satisfying.__Once you accept that the splitting of Mockingjay is a business decision, not a dramatic imperative, Part 1 comes off as a curiously satisfying nonaction movie.__This is as grim as PG-13 can get; the darkness is comparable to that of The Empire Strikes Back.__Lawrence delivers on what dramatic beats half a novel affords him. You just wish there were more of them and that they provided a more complete, more satisfying story arc.__Collins and the Lawrences have crossed the uncanny valley separating imagined dystopia from actual horrors, but they're also delivering a life lesson in cinema to teens: Things are stronger when they look real.__OK, there's less action in Games this time, but what's there is prime. And the acting is aces.__If it's more talky and less satisfying than its predecessor, the propulsive The Hunger Games: Catching Fire - largely because the conclusion won't come until next year with Part 2 - it's still a sporadically involving adventure.__The impressive supporting cast (which features Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Jeffrey Wright, and Woody Harrelson) keeps this highly watchable.__There's enough here to at least keep fans of the series involved and eagerly awaiting the grand finale.__"Mockingjay" is a rare bird in its genre, an action adventure with an interesting mind and a resonant spirit.__Although it doesn't make a lick of sense as a stand-alone story, "Mockingjay - Part 1" is the first "Hunger Games" movie with meat on its bones.__After its first two terrific installments, the newest edition of "The Hunger Games" left me hungry, like a feast that's stunningly prepared but flavorless and non-nutritious.__IMockingjay's placeholder status is a little too evident in its choppy, shapeless structure, this dark third chapter does have stretches of somber beauty.
Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind.__The lightly derisive, live-action-cartoon tone robs the movie of any majesty, even of the comic-book type, and the many violent deaths of their suitable gravity.__These meager pleasures are swallowed up in all the frantic action and overblown CG sequences.__Chris Pratt, overflowing with charisma, plays the leader of the pack of misfits, and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for seventies music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects.__Director and co-writer James Gunn brings a giddiness and a wondrous, endless sense of why-the-hell-not? possibility that's reminiscent of Star Wars.__Pratt is their prime asset for turning the comedy up to 11. With him playing Star-Lord, you never question what Quill brings to the team: a sparkling, cracked esprit de corps.__It may be a mess, but it's an extremely good-natured mess, full of humor and warmth. More surprising still, the very elements that seemed most likely to ruin the movie-the tree-man, the talking raccoon-account for much of its improbable charm.__Gunn appears to remember the high of certain kinds of moviegoing, where when the credits are over, all you want to do is get back in line and enjoy the whole thing again.__"Guardians of the Galaxy" has wit, energy and zaniness to spare. It will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more.__Guardians of the Galaxy is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in such hot weather.__Though based on a comics series launched in 1969, "Guardians" comes on with a hip, absurdist humor that feels thoroughly modern.__The characters are great and the movie is often very funny.__As directed by James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy never takes itself seriously and it's often a visual and musical treat. The Runaways' Cherry Bomb and David Bowie's Moonage Daydream? Yes, please.__The motley crew's repartee makes for comedy that's surprisingly consistent, yet freewheeling and sharp enough to pinball from Kevin Bacon to Jackson Pollock and back.__The people who made this movie must have had a swell time in the process, and it's nice to see a summer epic that takes itself so unseriously.__What sounds like a strained miscalculation turns out to be one of the most shamelessly enjoyable pranks ever pulled by a multibillion-dollar entertainment conglomerate. This is what happens when blockbuster filmmaking sits on a whoopee cushion.__If you're old enough to remember when sci-fi and comic books were fun, "Guardians of the Galaxy" will be your new favorite movie. If you're not, it will set a standard for everything you see.__Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the cliches of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun.__In place of wit, "Guardians" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it.__Guardians of the Galaxy is too loud, too long and too busy but - here's the good part - also wonderfully silly.
A movie that is, in the best sense of the word, a Marvel.__Beneath the expensive, computer-generated busyness of this second Captain America installment is a bracing, old-style conspiracy thriller made extra-scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade-offs of a post-9/11 world.__If Captain America: The Winter Soldier is indeed an augur of things to come during this special-effects-laden summer, maybe it won't be such a painful season after all.__This is the first Marvel Studios movie since the original Iron Man that really stands on its own.__In "Winter Soldier," amidst the chaos, our hero learns to be wary of the modern world. Welcome to the 21st century, Cap.__There's too much going on: the Marvel Universe stuff, the WikiLeaks-ish paranoia stuff, the video game-ish CG visual effects stuff, the epic John Woo-ish everybody-pointing-a-weapon-at-everybody-else face-off stuff.__We not only get an edgier, more complex, more compelling storyline, we get the most badass 95-year-old the world has ever known.__If we must endure yet another spring-summer cycle of comic book superheroes, this movie at least delivers the wham-bang goods (recycled though they may be).__I had fun. But I could have had more.__Like many others of its type, [it] gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up.__There's darkness and confusion just under its comic-book surface.__This film is unlikely to convert a non-Captain America lover into a fanatic but it's assembled with sufficient skill that those who enjoy this sort of motion picture will have a good time.__Captain America: The Winter Soldier injects new life into the Marvel movie universe and the superhero genre.__"The First Avenger" was a work of art, while "The Winter Soldier" is serviceable entertainment.__The best kind of blockbuster comic-book movie, tweaking the brain while dazzling the eye.__What makes "The Winter Soldier" so enjoyable ... and what will make it so profitable, is its emotional bandwidth-all the vivid, nuanced life lived by its characters in between their frenzied escapades.__Unless you're intimately familiar with the so-called Marvel universe (or you really love CG explosions), little of this will resonate.__"Captain America: The Winter Soldier" has the usual overlong running time, the half-hearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible.__The Winter Soldier cheerfully and efficiently does its job doing whatever Marvel movies are meant to do -- make you look forward to the next one, I guess.__On paper this sequel has some promising elements, but on screen it retreats from the very issues that it raises, and on a shelf next to "Captain America: The First Avenger," "The Winter Soldier" is pale.
The movie is a wonderful surprise, cleverly written and executed brick by brick with a visual panache.__Lord and Miller's sensibilities are continually clever, and The Lego Movie works hard to gradually deliver surprising payoffs to what seem to be throwaway bits.__The Lego Movie has enough wit and wisdom to send a recession-age message to families on the importance of thinking through problems with creativity.__As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception.__This is truly a movie that children and their parents can both enjoy for different reasons.__The Lego Movie: Merely a great film, or the greatest film ever in the history of cinema?__The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the story is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it's hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession -- constantly tweaking many popular culture icons.__The brightly-imagined Lego Movie is a wickedly smart and funny free-for-all, and sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding.__A total gas--even if its message is that we should do as Lego says, not as Lego does.__I stopped laughing because after 20 minutes, I'd had enough. The conceit gets stale fast.__A manic and surprising comedy inspired by toys that has more imagination and creativity than all the Transformers pictures combined.__A movie that's fast-paced and silly with enough throwaway clever in-jokes for their accompanying adults to justify a second viewing.__What could easily have been test-marketed, corporate-processed crap ... instead becomes a surprisingly enjoyable and satisfyingly dense family entertainment that pays tribute to the spirit of free play and individuality.__A clever, vividly imagined, consistently funny, eye-poppingly pretty and oddly profound movie ... about Legos.__It's the smartest, funniest and most dazzlingly inventive children's movie to come along in years.__A spirited romp through a world that looks distinctively familiar, and yet freshly inventive.__For the most part, it's a hoot. There's more ingenuity packed into one minute of this film than there is in the entire running time of most animated amusements.__The Lego Movie maybe be one giant advertisement, but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation, it's an earnest piece of work - a cash grab with a heart. Made for, with and about Legos, the movie is also made for, with and about imagination ...__The best part is what the movie has to say about conformity -- following the instructions on the box -- versus creativity, i.e. life as a jumble, an inspired improvisation, a joyous hodgepodge.__My fingers rebel, but type it I must: "The LEGO Movie" is the first great cinematic experience of 2014.
Untold manpower, pixels, and money culminate in the gangbusters final installment. It can't redeem the useless tedium of the first two, which exist for gargantuan profits and structural necessity.__Well, at least there won't be another one for a while.__It's adequately visionary, it's routinely spectacular, it breathes fire and yet somehow feels room-temperature.__It plays out as if someone chucked a whole bunch of carefully detailed Warhammer figurines into a centrifuge -- goblins, goats, dwarfs, wizards and wolves bouncing off one another in waves of alternating tedium and punishment.__It's a big, bold, schizophrenic pageant that still manages to work on a surprising number of levels -- creative liberties and indulgences be damned.__Mindless CGI spectacle overpowers every aspect of Peter Jackson's concluding Tolkien adaptation; like the other installments of this lumbering trilogy, it's more tech-demo than movie.__What is perhaps most depressing about Jackson's swollen Hobbit enterprise is the way it retrospectively diminishes his Lord of the Rings trilogy.__The pleasure is intense, and mixed with awe. There is majesty here, and not just because we're in the presence of magnificently regal madness.__Talk about beating a dead orc. In dutifully completing his prequel trilogy to his Lord of the Rings triumph, Peter Jackson has sadly saved the worst for last. The Battle of the Five Armies is 20 percent inspiration, 80 percent desperation.__Fighting -- presented with Jackson's usual double helpings of visual splendor, emotional oomph and low-key comedy -- is what "Battle of the Five Armies" is all about.__While more than enough praise has been poured on Jackson and his singular gift for CG spectacle, Martin Freeman deserves some credit for lending humor and humanity to what could have been a numbing orgy of pixelated mayhem.__The magic, fleeting to start with, is mostly gone.__It may occasionally seem to be aware of its undiluted preposterousness, but that hardly eases the experience of sitting through its endless cartoonish action sequences and overwrought emotional payoffs.__Considered as contemporary CGI-driven action-adventure cinema, and as the template for a new generation of video games, they are rich and entertaining. Even in the decadent phase of his genius, Jackson remains an expert world-builder and image-maker.__This third installment of The Hobbit trilogy is allegedly the shortest of all of Peter Jackson's Tolkien films, but my theater must have been orbiting a black hole because I could swear it swallowed up 20 years of my life.__What looked like indulgent folly at the outset now seems closer to epic justification, as Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy draws to a rousing close.__[Freeman] could have made a great Bilbo. Instead he's the one thing that has made this trilogy bearable.__Five armies are too many.__Bilbo may fully learn a sense of friendship and duty, and have quite a story to tell, but somewhere along the way, Mr. Jackson loses much of the magic.__If you want to see a Renaissance faire turned into an apocalyptic battlefield, this is the ticket.
The few authentic inspirations to be found in the movie's hundred and sixty-five roiling minutes involve gigantic science-fiction contrivances.__It barely matters whether this movie is good or bad. Bay is now the sort of filmmaker -- the only one, perhaps -- whose moviemaking goes beyond such binary banality.__In the end, though, this is still a movie about giant robots fighting each other, which is to say it's nearly impossible to take seriously on a narrative level.__Inflated, interminable and incoherent ...__You're either awestruck, dumbstruck or just plain struck in the face.__Long before Optimus Prime hoists his hulking metal frame onto the back of a giant robot dinosaur, wields his mighty sword and rides valiantly away to save the planet once more, Transformers: Age of Extinction plays like a parody ...__Bay has said that this film will kick off a second trilogy of Transformers movies - and I think he's serious. That means there will be (at least) two more of these things. God help us all.__I sincerely enjoyed the Transformer who was literally branded by Oreo.&#8234;__The movie's crammed with useless nuts and bolts, the storytelling equivalent of a mechanic who lifts the hood of your car and says, "That's everything, fix it yourself."__If it truly takes this long to save the world from the depredations of robots that turn into muscle cars, it may be that the world is no longer worth saving.__Reviewing a Transformers movie is a bit like reviewing a toy. In fact, it's exactly like reviewing a toy.__Transformers: Age of Extinction is nearly three %$^&%!!# hours, and they're brain-freezing.__Well before it finished I was numb from its bludgeoning excess.__This is as excruciating a movie as is likely to be experienced by anyone, anywhere.__The Transformers are brilliant, brave, world-conquering space travelers. Time to morph into something entertaining.__Go if you must, but bring earplugs.__It's still not a great movie, but it is, most definitely, full-metal Bay.__It is one of the most relentless movies I have ever seen. It just refuses to end.__Seriously, the next movie should just be called "Transformers: Hammer to the Skull."__The final confrontation alone lasts close to an hour, and at some point, you may find yourself simply in a daze, unable to absorb any further action into your brain.
As for the screenplay, by Linda Woolverton, it treads carefully, and all too kindly, in the footsteps of "Wicked" ...__'Maleficent' is an admittedly great-looking, sometimes creepy.__As a cameo, Jolie's performance might have proven spectacular; but as a protagonist, she doesn't give us enough to hold onto. For all her efforts, she remains yet another special effect, however spectacular.__All would be forgiven if the film had more magical feeling.__At least Disney was smart enough to cast Jolie. She has a genuinely heroic presence. If only the movie were equal to it.__Whatever its flaws, "Maleficent" is a family-friendly Disney adventure that offers a relaunched and thoroughly delightful Angelina Jolie ...__It hardly matters that Jolie's accent rambles a bit between pungent Cockney and plummy Buckingham Palace.__Jolie's commitment to the part is admirable: She gives this Maleficent a real emotional urgency. But the rest of the movie lets her down.__Long live the feminist revisionist backstory.__In the blood-red lipstick and midnight-black gown and cowl of her Sleeping Beauty antecedent, Jolie's Maleficent is magnificent.__Children of all ages should be dazzled.__Angelina Jolie's interpretation of the title character, which transforms the animated icon into a complex, fully realized woman, provides emotional depth and breadth.__Maleficent doesn't reinvent any wheels when it comes to the fairy-tale genre -- but the fairy tale already comes with pretty hardy wheels, and this sweet, child-friendly adaptation creaks along on them quite nicely.__This is Jolie's film because of the Maleficent she makes. Everyone else, even Aurora, fades in her presence.__While this is Jolie's show, obviously - and she's terrifically arch - the surprising dearth of other compelling characters doesn't offer much distraction when things get off track.__[It lacks] the sort of nightmarish visions that made Walt Disney's early animation features so powerful. This looks impressive, though, making use of highly imaginative, state-of-the-art 3-D effects while still evoking old-school Disney animation__For all its limitations, "Maleficent" manages to be improbably entertaining to watch, due solely to its title character.__I'm still not sure if the movie's smack-down between patriarchy and matriarchy is the way to go, but at least nobody here is warbling about what she wants before hitting the road to self-actualization.__Jolie comes to this party ready to bite, but the movie muzzles her. Even at 97 minutes, Maleficent is still one long, laborious slog.__A movie that doesn't quite work as a fantasy or as a subversion of the same.
Much of this takes place in the early 1970s, which gives the filmmakers an excuse to haul out lots of vintage kitsch and make some rather tasteless references to the Vietnam war.__The results are both dazzling and intimate, clever and - during one tour-de-force sequence - spectacularly funny.__I would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film.__Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this picture's new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards' limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink.__The plot is about a fearful society whose expansion of its security apparatus has unintended consequences, but Singer doesn't even touch the story's topical resonances... There's also no real moral quandary to be grappled with.__Perhaps more than any other superhero franchise, X-Men captures the overlapping fantasies of being unique yet not alone, and of being a hero but also being saved.__Having already directed the first two (and superior) X-Men films, Singer shows a level of comfort with both the material and the cast ...__[Singer is] reborn - deft, elegant, spring-heeled - in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The special effects don't bog him down: They lift the movie to a surreal and more emotional dimension.__The fireworks, the super-power circus, lots of surprise cameos and Big Moments - "X-Men: Days of Future Past" has them all. Logic? Who cares?__Ambitious, even audacious, the movie's mix of action and for-devotees-only intrigue can overwhelm, but there are moments of sheer virtuosity, too ...__What elevates this film above most of its predecessors is the dynamic action filmmaking and, above all, its wit.__For those who felt The Last Stand was a poor exit for many of these characters, X-Men: Days of Future Past should at least salve the wound in part.__The characters - and the performers playing them - step unto the breach to provide just enough wit and feeling to make "Days of Future Past" something other than a waste of a reasonable person's time.__In the capable hands of director Bryan Singer, who helmed the first two X-Men films, it's a nearly seamless adventure ride despite a plot that at times strains credulity.__If you are an "X" maniac, Singer's given you the movie you've been hoping for.__Time travel, Peter Dinklage and 1970s kitsch top a very long list of what makes "X-Men: Days of Future Past" such a blast.__The movie earns its keep with inspired one-off moments that showcase a mischievous sense of humor.__Once it reaches takeoff velocity, "Days of Future Past" becomes one of the best installments in the "X-Men" series.__For all its sociopolitical smarts and coded subtexts, the "X-Men" franchise, based on the Marvel comics, is primarily about entertainment, and this seventh installment is no different.__With characters like the impish Quicksilver, the movie recaptures something of the spirit of the comic's early days.
On the high-quality scale set by the Disney animated features in their latest Renaissance, this one doesn't quite measure up. But Big Hero 6 is sure to entertain millions of smart kids and their escort parents.__Kids will leave the theater wanting their own Baymax, and who can blame them? It's the rest of the "Heroes" that don't measure up; the robot full of air is the most real thing in the movie.__It's easier to like this movie because of the casual, low stakes of the enterprise.__Big Hero 6, the first Marvel comic book to get a Walt Disney makeover, is a beguiling kids movie. It is also a beauty to behold for its skillful digital animation in 3D.__A big, gorgeous, consistently funny and touching animated adventure.__Big Hero 6 offers something for everyone: action, camaraderie, superheroes and villains. But mostly, Baymax offers a compassionate and healing voice for those suffering, and a hug that can be felt through the screen.__Big Hero 6 celebrates nerd culture. And not merely the pop-culture- obsessed version (comic books) but the let's-invent-something-cool kind. Hey, kids, this PG flick asserts, it's good be taken with technology, crushed out on code, wowed by chemistry.__The breakthrough star of the season is here. His name is Baymax and he's impossible not to love. The 3-D animated Big Hero 6 would be a ton less fun without this irresistible blob of roly-poly, robot charisma.__Big Hero 6's considerable graces as an animated film-its fantastical layouts and bouncy sense of figure and motion-are offset by its deficiencies as a second-rate superhero flick.__At times, Big Hero 6 gets a little too noisy for its own good, but that never manages to drown out its many quieter charms.__Big Hero 6 qualifies as a better-than-average kids' movie with enough cross-generational appeal to make it a fine choice for a family weekend matinee.__Consider it a more family-friendly Guardians of the Galaxy, with the added kiddie appeal of a big, inflatable windbag to laugh at and love.__Gorgeous and disturbing, Big Hero 6 is a departure for Disney: a film targeted at older kids, and the studio's first venture into straight-up comic book culture.__It's fun, action-packed, and adorable.__Pow, pow, kaboom, cuddle. ...__The screenplay is smart enough to be considered adult-friendly. This isn't "classic Disney" but it's an experience parents and children can enjoy together in the dark, and sometimes that's all one can ask of a big-budget animated film.__What Big Hero 6 lacks in originality, it makes up for in charm.__The convoluted story gives the villain a motive that doesn't really make sense and is patched in too late in the narrative. Still, the 3-D animation is incredible.__A rousing movie that's satisfyingly infused with traditional Disney sentiment, however calculated its aims might sound.__With its appealing array of nerdy characters, inventive architecture and striking cross-cultural production design, Hero is a vibrant romp.
For dramatic verve and emotional nuance, apes trounce people, hands down, and the movie suffers badly from the mismatch; all traces of finesse are trampled by the bombast of the climax.__This just might be the most engrossing, the smartest and the most daring "Apes" movie ever put on film.__For the next installment, it might be wisest to forgo our own species altogether and make it all-ape. It is, after all, the logical next step in this particular cinematic evolution.__For all its high-end special effects and its Shakespearean ambitions, Dawn fumbles its emotional moments and forces its action.__One of the most intelligent and entertaining big-studio releases of the summer so far.__Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets to be exciting and to say something about the world instead of merely blowing it up. The apes are among the more intellectually complex characters you're likely to spend time with this summer.__What's striking about this new film is that it lays out the message-mongering in such a way that you can enjoy the movie equally well on a purely action level.__It is certainly thrilling to see how Reeves and his CGI wizards bring their hordes of apes to life. Honestly, if I didn't know they were computerized, I'd have thought they'd brought off an evolutionary miracle.__It's incredible. It sets the standard for blockbuster action movies, and manages to be even better than its predecessor.__Yes, it's Hollywood at its most manipulative. Still, Heston would hate to hear this...but, at least from a moviegoer's perspective, the coming ape-ocracy may be nothing to fear and something to champion after all.__Maybe that's the sad takeaway of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: that peace is futile, conflict inevitable. No matter the species, we're all doomed.__The visual look of the apes themselves is what brings it all home. Seeing is believing, and the magic of "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" is that it is so easy to believe.__This installment inches events closer to a merge point with 1968's Planet of the Apes while maintaining its own unique identity. It is in every way superior to Rise of the Planet of the Apes.__Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an extremely high-functioning sci-fi thriller about extremely high-functioning apes. Some of it may seem silly in the recounting, or in the trailer, but it doesn't feel silly in the theater.__The human characters (played by Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, and Keri Russell, among others) are so bland they don't stand a chance against their simian counterparts.__The tone is dire, the visuals dark and doomy, the pace epically slow. Like so many sequels, it's everything the first film aspired not to be.__Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best and brainiest blockbuster of the summer, the kind of movie you hope for when you pay your money and buy your popcorn.__Reeves directs with great dynamism, and his scenes of masses of apes swinging through treetops and swarming through San Francisco streets are rousingly staged.__It's the first big tent-pole film of 2014 that nails everything from start to finish, blending thoughtful allegory, meaningful science fiction and dazzling action spectacle without a hitch.__Here's a thought for the inevitable next film in this series: Ditch the humans. Stick with the apes. They're a lot more interesting.
Despite the efforts of Electro, the franchise is running shockingly low on juice.__About the best thing one can say about this fiasco is that Webb has taken only two films to reach the same exhausted, exhausting endpoint that Raimi required three to achieve. It's progress, of a sort.__This is a movie that needs to remove a piece of jewelry.__The trouble with director Marc Webb's disappointing sequel is it wants to have it both ways: to take seriously human connection and loss and also spin the spectacular and pulpy... Spider-Man 2 never locates that sweet spot.__The studios and the producers have to split the difference -- between excellence and adequacy, between darkness and light, between seriousness and fun. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 might have been split too far. It doesn't taste like anything.__I think I'll pass on The Amazing Spider-Man 3.__Overstuffed plot and too many villains, but the visual effects pop, and Garfield/Stone are still better than Maguire/Dunst.__The successes of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are human, the failures are typical of superhero CGI adaptations. In a world where the incredible is routine, the "amazing" is mundane.__The new Spider-Man series has managed to do in two films what the previous Spider-Man series did in three: transform an engrossing comic-book coming-of-age epic into an overstuffed and off-putting battle royale.__When Garfield conceals Peter's confused-angry- betrayed scowl beneath that shiny red mask, Spider-Man 2 summons the giddy derring-do of the best Iron Man offerings. It's a good movie that could have been great.__Fans who made the first movie such a huge success will doubtless find much to enjoy here, while others will long for the boldness, scope and wit of The Avengers.__Even though the ride is bumpy, the final destination is more than worth the effort.__Andrew Garfield, returning as Peter Parker, remains ingratiatingly jittery. You can believe that this kid, never at rest, could instantly transform himself into Spider-Man. He matches up well with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy.__How bad is this one ...? Amazingly so. Villainy abounds, but the villains are strident contrivances. Spider-Man flies, but does so dutifully, without joy.__Amazing is a word so overused it no longer has any impact, which makes it the perfect adjective for this second installment of the second franchise based on the Marvel Comics superhero.__"The Amazing Spider-Man 2" is easy to watch but hard to pin down, like a creature with eight legs going in different directions.__An unforgivably long assemblage that never coalesces into a compelling story.__The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not a new approach to the same old formula: no, it is basically a remake of other recent and derivative films.__This latest blockbuster assault wins us over, or wears us down, by dint of fine actors who are clearly enjoying themselves, in a film that thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously.__The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the fifth Spidey movie in 12 years, is overlong, underwhelming, unnecessary and sure to be a hot ticket.
This is what you get, San Francisco, with all your douchey, flashy, dot-com money: You get stomped on by Godzilla.__Godzilla handles everything the military hurls at him: ships, guns, planes, rockets, even a squadron of HALO paratroopers. The only thing that can cut him down to size is being relegated to a supporting role in his very own movie.__The beasts just want to have fun, but the gravest letdown in Edwards's film is that, most of the time, he fends off the chance to have fun himself.__We're here to see the film's leading lizard, who is pretty gorgeously realized by an army of digitizers, even if he seems just a bit-player in his own movie for the first hour or so.__The first truly joyous popcorn action movie of the season.__It's a tad better than the 1998 Godzilla, perhaps, but that's not saying much.__It's a smooth, sleek, technologically awe-inspiring 3-D blockbuster with a top-shelf cast (speaking middle-to-lower-shelf dialogue most of the time, to be sure, but they do it with style).__Godzilla - both the movie and the big guy - is ... something of a lumpy, lumbering great beast of a thing, lurching from city to city, continent to continent, smackdown to smackdown and plot point to plot point ...__Edwards' expertise in the visual effects field manifests itself in the seamlessness of the computer-generated imagery, if not in its extraordinariness.__It's a bracing tonic for the bored palate of the mainstream moviegoer, and one of the most intriguing big-budget breakthrough films since Steven Spielberg made "Jaws."__The reboot perfectly illustrates the problem that has long haunted mediocre monster movies. When the big, scaly guys are on screen, it's a fun thrill ride. But when the humans are at the center of the action, things get scary - and not in a good way.__Director Gareth Edwards bloats the film with human figures that never spring to life and sabotage the primal story.__If you're into superlatives - and who isn't? - Godzilla conjures the most jaw-dropping giant monster sequences since the original King Kong.__Ironically this big, lumbering movie could have used more, not less. More Godzilla without question, and more emotional content for its very good cast too.__This is exactly what big summer movies ought to aspire to: never short on dazzle, but unafraid to let us catch our breath once it's been taken away.__The more elements the movie piles on, the more diffuse and disjointed it becomes.__This Godzilla is ready for his close-up, and he looks pretty great in Imax 3-D.__Will you have fun watching this movie on opening weekend with friends? No doubt. Will you remember it in a year? Dubious.__There's a word for the kind of technocratic brains behind "Godzilla": unbalanced.__In Godzilla, director Gareth Edwards sets out to revive something that has practically disappeared from big-budget Hollywood spectacles: A sense of awe.
This sequel to the hit action comedy 21 Jump Street is better all around: the pacing is more consistent, the sight gags more imaginative, the self-referential jokes sharper.__22 Jump Street is hardly fresh, but the picture has enough energy to get by.__22 Jump Street is pretty much the exact same movie as 21 Jump Street. It knows it, you know it, and it knows that you know it. And that is why it's brilliant.__Self-referential irony is hardly a new gimmick, having served as the underlying premise for such franchises as Scream and Austin Powers, but rarely has it been indulged with such fervor.__Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's second-best film of the year (behind The Lego Movie).__Filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who are themselves impressive partners at this point) know enough not to mess with a successful formula.__22 Jump Street has the same writers and directors as the first film. But it's not smart this time as much as it is clever, and that cleverness tips into spottiness and cynical self-congratulation.__Jump Street knows you know about the predictability and cheapness of sequels and rip-offs -- and in this case, to avoid the downfalls of other summer comedy sagas, embracing that problem might have been the best move for this absurd, unique franchise.__Though I enjoyed enormously this latest offering in the rebooted Jump franchise, it's the effortless, unexpected bromance/partnership between the two unlikely undercover cops is what makes this franchise work.__There's something going on at the edges of the frame in practically every scene of 22 Jump Street, a testament to the care and attention to detail directors Lord and Miller bring to this potentially silly material.__They get to poke fun at sequels and simultaneously make sequel money, which is a great frigging gig if you ask me.__That Stoner No. 3 from Knocked Up and the tank top from Step Up have become Hollywood's freshest comedy duo is impressive.__At what point is sarcasm just a cheap substitute for wit? Exactly when does joking about how all sequels are just lame, repetitive cash-grabs start to suggest that maybe yours is, too? Actually, in this case, about 40 minutes in.__There's no real reason "22 Jump Street" should work. Yet it does.__Does the meta-acknowledgment that everyone's in it for the bucks give a purposefully dopey sequel more cred? ... You bet.__This sequel's spoof of its predecessor's riff on the original 1980s-era buddy-cop TV show coalesces into a raucous, raunchy, irreverent, imperfect riot.__Lord and Miller are on a roll, and there may be no better moviemakers at playing to our modern need for irony - at giving us the entertainment we crave while acknowledging our distrust of it.__If it seemed Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill couldn't possibly exceed their over-the-top buddy cop antics of 21 Jump Street, you lost that bet.__What separates 22 Jump Street from sequel mediocrity is that everyone's in on the joke.__Remember that feeling when you realized The Hangover II was A sequel that has as many laughs as a Texas spring has tornadoes.
In one way, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a triumph for producer Michael Bay in that it is equally as godawful as his Transformers: Age of Extinction and a hit nonetheless.__It's essentially a Transformers movie - a Michael Bay production complete with mass destruction, urban panic, white-hot lighting, inane quips, product placement, explosions and, well, Megan Fox.__I had to draw on my own ninja training and reflect intensively on the transitory nature of all phenomena, just to fend off the profound yearning for death.__It's pretty much business as usual: one personality trait per turtle (with the most screen time for party-dude Michelangelo), lots of wisecracks, plenty of thin-crust product placement (Pizza Hut this time around), and even a last-minute cowabunga.__Turtles fans might have been looking for their own Avengers. They get Alvin and the Chipmunks on performance enhancers and mass-market pizza instead. In Hollywood, history repeats first as farce, then as marketing.__Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles doesn't so much provide brainless enjoyment as it pummels the viewer into submission. "Shell-shocked" is a reasonable description of the experience.__If you thought Michael Bay had forgiven Megan Fox for saying he was "like Hitler," this new April O'Neil role is proof he hasn't.__For having gone to the trouble of making a self-descriptive movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, its producers seem ultimately unsure about its most basic concept.__The repartee, as ever, is weak. Even with all the extra layers of digital detail, it's still tough to keep these four straight.__The kind of cliched, misfit crimefighters-versus-demented villains scenario that Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird happily parodied when they came up with the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic books way back in the 1980s.__There's enough turtle power to please kids and fans of the original series.__Cowabunga, dudes.__Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a reboot that plays as if it were made from a starter kit. Everything comes right out of the 2014 blockbuster catalog.__Attached to this movie, the title no longer sounds zany; it looks like a series of keywords.__There is something half-hearted about the entire film, as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it, not because they should make it, but just because they could.__There's no lack of craft here, but there's certainly an absence of character.__Not much of an effort is made to differentiate the personalities of the turtles, who all frankly look as grotesque as a Terry Gilliam cartoon.__Rougher and slightly funnier than the 1990 original, but still harmless junk at best.__Even youngsters may wonder why any hint of charm or fun has scurried away. Those new to the franchise may withdraw their head into their neck, turtle-like.__While this reboot is fun, it's also forgettable and occasionally infuriating.
This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.__"Interstellar" is a grand undertaking, but in shooting for the stars, it loses its footing. It goes to infinity and beyond, when infinity would have been plenty.__Jessica Chastain deserves Best Supporting Actress consideration for her work. One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.__After the first hour, with its poignant depiction of humanity's decline, Interstellar always seems to be rebuilding its momentum, offering plenty to think about but little to hold on to.__It's a film I didn't exactly enjoy and can't say I would recommend. And yet as an event, as a singular movie-watching opportunity, it's undoubtedly worthwhile.__Interstellar may be a preposterous epic, but it is an epic nonetheless.__The Nolans plant some actual characters onto that landscape, but it's too arid for anything interesting to grow.__Interstellar is thrilling to watch across its moments but ultimately unmemorable; I feel it slipping away from me even now.__Interstellar is as cinematically epic as it is dramatically intimate.__Nolan, a director often accused of coldness, finally got all mushy when he went to outer space. I can't solve that equation, but I've enjoyed trying to scratch it out.__Christopher Nolan's 168-minute odyssey through the space-time continuum is stuffed with stuff of bewildering wrongness.__What the neg-heads are missing about Interstellar is how enthralling it is, how gracefully it blends the cosmic and the intimate, how deftly Nolan explores the infinite in the smallest human details.__Interstellar is an entertainment disaster for reasons that have dogged our films since they began: ridiculous story; implausible segues; laughable dialogue; the absence of character, drama, and command.__By the closing credits, it seems possible that Nolan himself hails from another planet, and while he has tried diligently to show humanity in a flattering light, he lacks enough inside information to get it right.__This isn't Nolan's best movie, but his ambitions and trust in the audience keep getting bigger. He's one of Hollywood's few true remaining visionaries, and he's only getting warmed up.__Comes closer to mimicking the feel and structure of 20th-century hard sci-fi in the Arthur C. Clarke mode that just about any other movie.__For a movie about transcending all manner of dimensions, "Interstellar" ultimately falls surprisingly flat.__It's a mass audience picture that's intelligent as well as epic, with a sophisticated script that's as interested in emotional moments as immersive visuals. Which is saying a lot.__Even a cool cat like Christopher Nolan can cough up a furball - and with his sci-fi adventure Interstellar, it's blockbuster-sized.__The parts of Interstellar that don't work -- a third act (out of four) that descends into suspense-movie silliness, an increasing reliance on mystical mumbo-jumbo -- struggle against the many parts that do.
Hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a respectable sequel filled with moments of humour and emotion among its ample noise and movement.__The writer and director Dean DeBlois takes the comedy to a deeper, more satisfying place than he did in the original franchise-launching animated film.__Overlong and overly busy but more emotionally powerful than its predecessor.__The entire film is a romance -- visually, parentally, ecologically. It's got the emotional, humorous, exciting sweep you want from a summer movie.__Although there are times when bits of the movie feel extraneous, the production as a whole comes across more like an organic extension of the original tale than something tacked on purely to score at the box office.__It's clear that [director Dean DeBlois] took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy - not a bad model for breathing new life, and yes, a bit of fire, into one of Hollywood's more nuanced animated franchises.__How to Train Your Dragon 2 is soaring, emotionally swooping, utterly satisfying fun.__Not only does this second movie match the charm, wit, animation skill and intelligent storytelling of the original, I think it even exceeds it.__Despite its expanded, ambitious battle sequences, Dragon 2 is at its best when it quiets down and dares to be intimate.__One of the most beautiful animated films ever made.__More than just teaching kids what to think about the world they're coming into, it's a rare film that encourages them to think for themselves.__This was not a sequel that anybody needed, outside of the accountants. And there's another already planned.__One of this year's true surprises, the superior animated sequel not only is infused with the same independent spirit and off-kilter aesthetic that enriched the original, it also deepens the first film's major themes.__It's a rip-roaring ride.__Nothing in this likable sequel flies quite so high as those aerial shots.__Young and old fans of the first movie will be lining up for the wit, for the inventiveness of the characters, for the breathtaking visuals - and just the sheer fun of it all.__This may be the first and last time anyone says this, but if "How to Train Your Dragon 2" is this good, why stop at 3 and 4?__Most sequels get made for commercial reasons, whether or not the world needs them. "How to Train Your Dragon 2" is a movie the world needs.__The impressive part is the storytelling confidence of writer/director Dean DeBlois. He has created a thoughtful tale as meaningful for grown-ups as it is pleasurable for its young primary audience.__Nearly as exuberant as the original, How to Train Your Dragon 2 nimbly avoids sequel-itis.
This is a nutty film, and for the most part I mean that in a good way.__Gone Girl promises to be an unnerving portrait of marriage as ruin, but then it opts for madness and implausibility.__This is the most elegant, exquisitely made trash.__Fincher is as Fincher does. And what Fincher does better than almost anyone is create moody, meticulously crafted thrillers that straddle the divide between genre and art.__Gone Girl is a sick movie, but it's a lumbering, anti-imaginative kind of sick.__In the film's final stages [Fincher] seems to be relying entirely on craft - but, boy, is it effective craft.__The film's stabs at social commentary -- the constant barrage of tabloid TV coverage -- are crushingly obvious.__Once you release the movie from the demand that it be significant, there are a number of achievements.__It's sick fun that leaves a scar; popcorn entertainment that bites back. Dig in.__Fans of Flynn's 2012 novel will not be one tiny bit disappointed.__145 minutes of riveting drama and surprises.__Gone Girl presents a deft mix of whodunit and who-you-gonna-believe?__Director David Fincher lands a tone for Gone Girl that's broad and precise enough to encourage a series of witty performances within the thriller framework.__Glossy, empty and ultimately unsatisfying - if undeniably entertaining ...__Flynn's great accomplishment, in her book and here, is an unstinting dedication to plot mechanics that jar our balance.__Gone Girl thrives on enigma, and the leads embody that quality to wonderful effect.__Gillian Flynn's playful novel is now David Fincher's chilling movie. Still packed with twists and turns, but the overall effect is unsettling.__Even knowing what's ahead doesn't prepare you for the movie's tone, which is funny yet curdled and cynical and bleak.__Gillian Flynn's twist-laden mystery novel gets a somber, respectful screen treatment from David Fincher, which has the unfortunate effect of diminishing the book's diabolical fun and heightening its dull misanthropy.__A deliciously manipulative mystery that toys with the viewer like a femme fatale with her prey.
Barely diverting.__It's all pretty dumb, and it marks a career low for director Neil Burger, who's made some first-class indie dramas from his own scripts.__The first film adapted from Veronica Roth's generically dystopian book series arrives with a sludgy, gray-hued plop.__The climactic chases, shootouts, and fistfights have been staged, filmed, and edited with insobriety. Visual clarity shouldn't be too much to ask from these movies, even if they fail to achieve ideological coherence.__Jackhammer music and sound design are all that hold the action scenes together.__If you can forget what it's saying, Divergent is fairly entertaining.__The performances -- namely from stars Shailene Woodley and Theo James and Kate Winslet in a juicy supporting role -- always make the movie watchable and often quite engaging.__Woodley is an obviously talented actress, a standout in The Descendants and The Spectacular Now but she's let down by the story surrounding her.__Fans of the book will likely be pleased. More importantly, people who don't know a thing about the books may get swept up, as well.__With a couple of elaborate action set pieces and some trippy, dreamlike sequences when Tris' thoughts are on display, Divergent is sure-footed, suspenseful, and sequel-ready.__The dark, oppressive movie around Woodley drags her down like an overcoat with stones in the pockets.__Directed by Neil Burger, Divergent is a solidly engaging outing. Only one wishes for more.__Although not quite as well-focused as The Hunger Games, Divergent employs many of the same elements: a futuristic post-war setting, a strong heroine, a romance, and a struggle against the oppression inherent in the status quo.__Though its main appeal will be to those who read the book and are young adults either in fact or in spirit, "Divergent" does have something for the rest of us and that's the chance to see the pair of performers who make that romantic music together.__Ironically for a film about non-conformity, it adheres to the playbook rather slavishly.__Overall I was delighted with Divergent and am eager to see how the remaining two films continue to take us on Tris' adventure, as she and Four attempt to learn what's really going on in their very crazy world.__Burger, whose last divergent character was the smart-drugged protagonist of Limitless, allocates more than enough of this overlong movie to details of life and society in future-Chicagoland. But he fails to make any aspect of the premise persuasive.__"Divergent" is almost good enough to make you forget what a cynical exercise it is on every possible level.__The real problem with "Divergent"? In the end, it doesn't dare diverge enough.__Hey, we gotta kill time between Hunger Games installments somehow. Why not Divergent?
The young married couple does something cruel, and then the idiot frat guys next door respond, and back and forth it goes. I laughed, but not uproariously and not often enough.__It's Apatow without the Apatow, all ornaments and no tree.__As as tensions escalate, Teddy and Peter's partnership proves just as central and perhaps more vulnerable than Mac and Kelly's. Score one for growing up.__Rogen's always a dominating presence, but [Byrne], who showed her comic chops in Bridesmaids, comes close to stealing the movie here, in an uncorked performance full of volatile, liberating mischief.__One of the great surprises of Neighbors is both the gentle way with which it handles a nimrod party animal like Teddy and how good Efron is at playing him.__It's gross, all right, but rarely funny -- unless jokes about alcohol-laced breast milk is your thing.__The performances are solid. Rogen does his usual, husky-boy geek thing while Efron seems more comfortable as a dreamboat than as a doctor in last year's Parkland. It's the script that lets them down.__Fortunately, Rogen and Byrne make for an appealingly frazzled and conflicted couple.__It's the most rollicking frat comedy since Revenge of the Nerds II. (Miss you, Booger.)__You laugh a lot. And you don't feel guilty for a second.__Unfortunately, concise comedy gives way to desperation less that halfway through, and we're left with the spectacle of adults embracing extreme immaturity just because they can.__There's no doubt the filmmakers want to make us laugh but, in doing so, they also touch upon a theme that many older viewers will find familiar: the rite of passage from a college party animal to the responsible role of a father or mother.__This raunchy unrooting of a settled suburban idyll exposes the considerable angst of emerging adulthood with a kind of scatological fervor designed to elicit oodles of inappropriate laughs.__Neighbors is the Animal House for an era in which food fights seem quaint.__The most shocking thing about the hard-R comedy "Neighbors" is that - surprise - it's actually rather endearing.__As a simple story of escalating sabotage, the piece can afford to be meandering and disjointed as long as there's a belly laugh every couple of minutes.__[Brings its] raunchy scenario to a payoff that upholds the very middle-class values the movie gleefully profanes.__Though not as comedically energetic or culturally incisive as it could be, the movie squeaks by thanks to the camaraderie of an unlikely duo: Seth Rogen and Zac Efron.__You expect hardcore hilarity from Neighbors, and you get it. It's the nuance that sneaks up on you.__"Neighbors" represents something of a watershed: the moment when all those Judd Apatow bad boys tremble on the edge of maturity, look back, and see the soulless face of a younger generation gaining on them.
Nothing in the movie makes sense, but I prefer to think that "Ride Along" is just a badly told joke, rather than an insult to its audience.__Ride Along is saddled with an uninvolving plot, and largely content to coast on cop-movie cliches.__The most truthful answer is friendly but unexciting: They're OK. They're pretty good.__As a comedian [Hart] has been begging for Hollywood's attention for five years. He has it now, but you've got to believe he can do better than this.__This routine buddy picture offers plenty of instant gratification (Cube and Hart are easygoing screen presences, and many of their one-liners are funny) but shows little concern for characterization, storytelling, or even comic pacing.__This is a live-action cartoon.__Since the film's largely schematic subplot about Serbian gunrunners can't manage much in the way of originality, it's fortunate that Story knows his way around a comedy.__Ride Along  has the dubious distinction of being simultaneously shoddy and straining, lazy and desperate.__Kevin Hart's mouth is the sole reason for the existence of the by-the-numbers buddy comedy Ride Along, which rises and falls on the strength of his chattery comic delivery.__Hart's springy energy and Ice Cube's deadpan snarl can be amusing, but they can't compensate for weak material.__An Ice Cube and Kevin Hart comedy that will probably be in a Rite-Aid discount bin in about six months.__At its best, Ride Along is tolerable. At its worst, it borders on insulting.__[Most] of the movie is a wash of buddy cop cliches and double crosses that aren't worth the cocktail napkin they were jotted on.__Ride Along is a film so casual in its conception and execution, it should be titled Drive Thru.__Cube is solid as the impenetrable brick wall that Hart's comic barrage bounces off. Their odd-couple shtick delivers laughs. But more often than not "Ride Along" chokes on its own fumes.__It's a noisy ride to nowhere.__The plot twists are easily guessed, and the film goes on for one predicament too long, but there are some good laughs.__[Hart] gives Ride just enough buoyancy to keep it afloat, despite a story that would sink most performances.__A forum for Kevin Hart to be the best stand-up comedian he can be.__Gives shoddiness a bad name.
The movie has one goal: to amuse the most children with the least amount of effort.__The musical moments, on the whole, stand out as the highlights of the film; Rio 2 becomes watchable when the flat characters shut up and sing.__Rio 2 has a childish, delicious-looking beauty. It's like watching a box of Froot Loops explode just beyond the tip of your nose. Bring milk.__Where the film excels ... in an even more pronounced way than the first film, is in the choreographed animation for the musical numbers.__It'll keep the kids content for a couple of hours, though it's likely to bore the grown-ups.__It's as good as the first one and sure to please both the kiddies and adults with its two-tiered humor.__Wonderfully animated and well-voiced, "Rio 2" is nevertheless too much. Too much plot, too many issues, too many characters.__The cinematic equivalent of attack by kaleidoscope, "Rio 2" sucks you in and whirls you around before spitting you out, exhausted.__The story flows, but not always freely, thanks to its manufactured feel.__[A] ramshackle, riotously beautiful sequel to the smash 2011 musical-comedy.__Those who enjoyed the adventures of Blu and Jewel and company in the first Rio are going to find the sequel an equally pleasing diversion.__All in all, though, the movie feels at once too busy and too derivative. That's no easy feat, but it's also one sequel-makers probably shouldn't aspire to.__With so much going on, it's a wonder this kids' movie is only five minutes longer than the original. But for the music and brilliantly picturesque look, it's worth the 3-D ticket.__An agreeable song-and-dance movie, a laugh here, a laugh there, pleasant but overly busy, for seemingly no real reason other than to throw a few more set pieces at the wall to see what sticks.__The movie's an acceptable, if tiring, baby sitter.__It's like the last "Hobbit" movie - so much time passes between side plots that you have to jog the memory when a minor character appears again. Who's that toucan again? Is he a bad guy?__Even when it's coarse and calculating, this is an eager entertainment machine that will keep the kids satisfied. Just don't tell them that the Rio movies are musical comedies about an avian genocide.__We're grading on a sliding scale here. But if "Rio 2" is hardly Pixar quality, it's certainly better than the average animated sequel.__Rio 2 teems with colorful animated splendor and elaborate musical numbers, but its rambling, hectic, if good-hearted, story is for the birds.__Despite the attempts at broadening the secondary ideological themes, this is another familiar father-in-crisis tale, dotted with musical interludes for Chenoweth and Clement, and dressed in brighter plumage.
When it comes to navigating how to be both a family-friendly holiday crowdpleaser and a faithful adaptation of a tricky but profound musical, Into the Woods is mostly golden.__With the exception of Meryl Streep (as the Witch) and James Corden (as the Baker), the cast is bland, and the bombastic orchestrations tend to steamroll the nuances of Sondheim's score.__If you go down to the woods today... you'll find A-listers dressed like 'Game of Thrones' extras belting out showtunes.__The movie is a watchable, tuneful contraption.__Marshall's film captures enough of the emotions that course through this sneaky fairy tale about childish things like love, sex, grief, insecurity, abandonment, and forbearance.__A jolly mash-up of symbol-laden, signature once-upon-a-time tales about lust, envy, greed, and misguided pursuits of happiness.__"Into the Woods," the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for "children of all ages."__"Into the Woods" could have taken a well-worn path toward stagey sentiments, but those who worried that Hollywood might drain the enchantment from the Enchanted Forest can live happily after.__The sly send-up of fantasy tropes and healthy doses of humor help Into the Woods feel very much like the books and films it gently satirizes, even as it stands on its own as a solid entry into the musical-fantasy genre.__Rob Marshall - who previously shepherded a glossy if slightly diluted version of "Chicago" to the screen - does a decent job transferring the material.__As with Chicago, Marshall makes bold choices, but they pay off. His cast may glitter with film stars, but they work as an ensemble and keep their stories emotionally true against a terrifically rich orchestral accompaniment.__What makes "Into the Woods" so entertaining is the cleverness of the tale itself and the way specific characters match the talents of its storytellers.__Instead of being a rueful meditation on the inevitable disappointments of adulthood, the last act plays out as a generic dystopian bummer.__A mixed bag of clever twists on familiar storybook myths, engaging performances and forgettable songs.__"Into the Woods" is a paean to the primal magic of storytelling.__The Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine 1987 musical Into the Woods has been transferred to the screen by director Rob Marshall with most of its complexities and light-dark tonalities intact.__I left disenchanted and irritated by so many missed opportunities.__"Into the Woods'' thankfully retains most of its wit and bite, and showcases two of the year's very best female performances, from Streep and Blunt.__Does it work as a movie? Thanks to a few cast members, the answer is - yes, and for the most part quite nicely.__For anyone who can appreciate the darker side of fairy-tales told in a musical with depth and nuance, Into the Woods is a journey worth taking.
Lucy is not about to win any prizes from Mensa ... but this isn't quite like any other blockbuster you'll see this year.__No one has ever accused French action director Luc Besson of thinking too hard, and this frantic exercise in pseudoscience and goofball metaphysics is best enjoyed by following his lead.__Part philosophical/scientific treatise, part action movie, a film that goes from mayhem to boredom in a heartbeat.__Besson has made very, very bad films in the past, but this is the first time he has presented one so idiotic that the only way to properly convey its flaws is to enumerate them.__Scarlett Johansson carries the film effortlessly, bridging Besson's narrative and logical ellipses by fully embracing his crowd-pleasing intentions and convincingly depicting Lucy's psychological transformation.__This movie worries that humanity is wasting its potential, which is a bizarre fear for a movie that has this many nonsensical shootouts. But that's what on Besson's mind: the Big Bang and bang-bang.__In the showiest sequence, Lucy's body starts exploding into bursts of confetti. Even then, Johannson holds everything together. She's the rare actress who brings conviction and clarity to flights of fancy.__I know we're supposed to think that Besson's daffy cinematic calisthenics are entertaining because at least they are not boring. But I was bored.__Lucy is a welcome reminder of just how much Besson's wry sensibility as a filmmaker adds to movies like this.__The summer's best, coolest, juiciest, smartest action movie.__An outlandishly entertaining mixture of high silliness and high style.__It's a funny thing how smart and stupid often seem so similarly mechanical in movies, but thanks to Johansson's performance, we have a fizzy cocktail of a film that blends both ingredients.__A sci-fi yarn that ponders the meaning of time and the importance of evolution while occasionally throwing in some shootouts.__"Lucy" may be scientific hogwash, but it does raise all sorts of questions you rarely find in a shoot-out flick.__For Besson devotees who sat stoically through "The Lady" (or patiently during that endless "Arthur and the Invisibles" series) "Lucy" is a trippy return to form - to mind-twisting stories, to rocket-propelled camerawork, to eyes-wide-open dreams.__A dynamic melange of conflicting genres balanced on a high wire of pure irony.__No one onscreen has the answers to the lofty questions Besson poses and, despite all the dizzying and splendid imagery of the film's closing frames, it's patently clear that neither does he.__Feigns depth, but what lingers is Besson's regressive belief that even the most intelligent woman on earth can't figure out how to get her way without a miniskirt and a gun__Does it make sense? Not at all. Is it boring? Not that either.__This goofily enjoyable but ultimately forgettable techno-thriller plays like a cross between Transcendence and La Femme Nikita with a bit of Hong Kong-style action and low-rent 2001-era Stanley Kubrick thrown in for good measure.
The Fault In Our Stars could indeed become this generation's Love Story -- mildly implausible, but genuinely moving.__The film has enough charm and humor to keep it appealing to a wide audience, and dumbing things down doesn't feel particularly smart or canny, and proves to be a minor distraction to an otherwise majorly entertaining feature.__Far from the shameless emotional pummeling it might have been, this adaptation of John Green's cherished YA cancer drama finds a conduit to earned, understated tears -- a tricky accomplishment given the material.__"The Fault in Our Stars" may not show the true messiness of cancer, but it does grapple with death and the ability to survive great loss. Maybe that's enough truth for one movie.__Led by the unforgettable work from a young actress who's among the best of her generation, "The Fault in Our Stars" is a lovely work.__While it may not conform to one's real-life expectations it certainly hews tightly to teen-flick conventions.__The film dodges most of the pitfalls of cliched cancer dramas with humor and natural warmth.__An emotional climax arrives every 15 minutes or so, and every affecting moment is underscored with a soppy light-rock song.__What in the name of God is wrong with me that I didn't cry once -- I, who just the day before wept through the entirety of my child's thoroughly upbeat school play.__The Fault in Our Stars is a heart-breaker for sure, but it's also a sweet, romantic film full of sudden warmth and humor. It gets everything right about being young and in love for the first time.__There's a moment when the breeziness powering the story goes away and medical reality takes over, and Elgort's performance goes to a surprising new place.__Big movies have their embedded lessons in heroism, but it's nice to have tales of human-scale fortitude.__The film is highly manipulative, all right, but in ways that allow the audience a modicum of self-respect. The sniffling legions at the screening I attended needn't have felt like fools.__Woodley ... balances grace with gravity, wit with heart.__The honest, human performances from stars Ansel Elgort and especially Shailene Woodley keep it grounded, even when things start to wander or threaten to get too precious.__Wears its cynicism the way many young people do: awkwardly and not very convincingly.__It promises something that it doesn't deliver, and insincerity is the last thing you want in a film like this.__What leavens the heaviness of the theme is the heroine's wry wit, which Ms. Woodley deploys just as naturally.__Well, of course the book is better.__What sustains the film through the rockier times are its challenging themes, offering real issues for the young protagonists to wrestle with, rather than whether anyone will be carded trying to buy beer.
Unbroken falls short of the epic war drama and sweeping testament-to-the-human-spirit it strives to be.__"Unbroken" is a rousing old-fashioned yarn with numerous exciting set-pieces and an uncomplicated hero you root for all the way through. It's entertaining throughout and made with a high level of technical skill.__A straightforward and entirely commendable story about the triumph of the human spirit, etc.__Given its subject, it should have been great, but it turns out to be simply good.__In a well-made, but one-note film.__"Unbroken" stirs a moviegoer by default; it's an astounding story of human endurance that has been brought a little too safely to the screen.__It is a harrowing journey, and an inspirational one. But, as director, Jolie takes far too long to tell it, particularly in such a conventional manner.__A tale of endurance, "Unbroken" takes endurance to sit through.__Handsome, alert and intensely focused, little-known English actor Jack O'Connell is a fine choice as Louis. And Japanese pop star Takamasa "Miyavi" Ishihara shines as "The Bird,' Louis' sadistic captor and war criminal in training.__Unbroken is a fitting title for this excruciating cinematic treatment of the flyboy's ordeal. It plays like an endless, unrelieved gauntlet of suffering, an onslaught untempered by grace or redemption.__If you can take it, "Unbroken" will lift you like the classics of adventure cinema.__What the movie ends up in desperate need of is a sense of life made real and palpable through dreadful, transporting details, not a life embalmed in hagiographic awe.__If nothing else, it's certainly better than the last time a good-looking Hollywood star decided to direct a movie about WWII. But the less said about George Clooney's The Monuments Men, the better .__Jolie gets the dirty/ennobling job done.__Despite its many impressive elements, "Unbroken" plays incomplete and unbalanced.__Jolie hasn't done a disservice to Zamperini's life, but it's hard to know what she was trying to tell. It's Zamperini's story in fact and circumstance, but somehow, he feels like an enigma.__For Jolie, it's all about the suffering, without much meaning.__As a castaway story, a historical drama and a portrait of an Olympian turned soldier, "Unbroken" is a touching and important work.__Zamperini's life story is genuinely inspirational, but the movie seems fashioned as a standard-issue profile in courage.__One of the finest achievements of the 2014 film year.
It's all dumb, but fun.__The exhibits in this "Night at the Museum" may still come to life nightly. But their latest movie stays stubbornly inert.__Funny, charming kiddie-flick fare.__There are some key elements that make this "Night at the Museum" sequel work better than its predecessor.__Like many a sequel that has exhausted its plot possibilities, Secret of the Tomb looks abroad to add color and culture.__Let the dust finally settle on these museum pieces.__It's kind of fun, unembarrassingly, and not least of all because the people who made it look like they had a good time doing so.__Assuming Wilson isn't being eyed as Stiller's replacement (or are we starting rumors?), it's satisfying to see this series ultimately shake off the relic dust and bow out with energy.__A diverting and, here and there, rather funny journey for the museum stalwart Larry and his menagerie of Teddy Roosevelt, a miniature Roman general, a Neanderthal, a capuchin monkey and others.__Ben Stiller, Steve Coogan, Owen Wilson, Ricky Gervais -- all of them were considered edgy when they first arrived on the scene, but for some performers an edge is just something you use to pry open the piggy bank.__Ben Stiller and crew go for the easy laughs, spackling the cracks in their armor with a cavalcade of marquee-name cameos and one dizzying action scene after another.__Granted, this series is primarily for kids, but nobody should feel dumber after watching a movie with "museum" in the title.__Williams glows briefly in one of his final roles, but the overall magic feels dim.__Mainly for "Night at the Museum" diehards.__Other than some stock establishing shots of London, the British setting is wasted, as are Ben Kingsley and Ricky Gervais, who, at times, seem almost embarrassed to be caught on camera.__It's a hectic pileup, this movie, but at least in its final laps it takes the time to say its goodbyes more or less properly.__"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb" is a rather lackluster affair, a cash grab that tries to aim a little higher but confuses sappy shortcuts with real emotion.__Frankly, there isn't a whole lot about this scenario that isn't disturbing on some level.__What is unexpected is the depth of emotion of many of the situations ...__There's a serenity to museum visits, especially if it's a place you know and love. "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb," amazingly, recaptures that feeling in big-studio franchise form.
Back in his day, Mr. Peabody was a dog whose over-civility had bite. Now he's a genius you want to cuddle with.__More puns, less story, please.__Fifty years ago, animated entertainment was a lot quieter. But that was my "Mr. Peabody & Sherman." This is someone else's. And it should give them, and even a few open-minded parents, almost just as much giggly fun.__Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a cool, midcentury-modern look (dog and boy live in a populuxe Manhattan penthouse) and a voice cast that may not be A-list but fits the bill nicely.__Mr. Peabody is fast-paced and jammed with rib-poking historical references, but it couldn't be called witty, even on the broadly winking level of the original cartoon.__The film's saving grace is its character design and use of 3D techniques to speed things up in every sense when the plot starts to flag.__Swift, peppy and defiantly unendearing, DreamWorks' latest toon updates the zany adventures of the time-traveling dog-and-his-boy sideshow from 'Rocky and Bullwinkle.__Most of the vocal performers are promising, from Ty Burrell and Max Charles as Mr. Peabody and Sherman to Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann as Penny's parents.__For all the ways the film reflects its earlier TV incarnation, the shadings have been softened. "Mr. Peabody" could use a bit more bite.__Frantically paced by director Rob Minkoff ("The Lion King") and making very effective use of 3D - Hey! Get that sword out of my face! - the movie will surely appeal to kids.__Mr. Peabody & Sherman is slight, but it's exceedingly charming, making good use of a talented voice cast that includes Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann, Mel Brooks as Freud, and Stanley Tucci as Leonardo Da Vinci.__Kids of all ages are sure to enjoy this visually splendid, fast-paced blast through the past.__Happily, the fallout results in Peabody, Sherman, and Penny all getting caught up in WABAC-machine zaniness together.__The movie has trouble stitching together disjointed episodes into a coherent narrative. Thanks to a strong voice cast, however, the characters retain their charm throughout.__You'll need not only your own WABAC machine, but also a shower.__Burrell doesn't quite capture the wry deadpan of the original, but then, neither does the movie. That's okay.__What a relief to see that while "Mr. Peabody's" visuals are enhanced to sleek 21st-century standards, the essential charm of the series survives more or less intact.__Needing to fill an extra 85 minutes, the filmmakers clumsily explore the characters' therapeutic needs.__The film's animation design is strictly generic in its rounded edges and dutiful 3-D IN YOUR FACE!!! gimmicks. And the story gets off to such a sour start, it takes a long time for the comedy to recover.__A smart, funny and beautifully designed feature ...
The mere existence of 300: Rise of an Empire is worthy of note, especially the inventive means by which the story has been advanced.__Artemisia may ultimately have lost the war in this clash of civilizations, but she wins our hearts.__Don't be surprised if, two weeks from now, you forget it ever existed.__Long on crimson spurts of blood but low on character, larded with production value but bereft of any other kind of it, "300: Rise of an Empire' is a 3D joke.__There is much grinding of teeth, and mauling of history, and anachronistic use of gunpowder, until we plug our ears and desperately pray to the gods of Olympus, or the brothers of Warner, that they might make an end.__If the movie's action recalls video games, the dramatically artificial lighting suggests 1980s rock videos. Indeed, Rise of an Empire is so campy that it might work better as a musical.__An extension of the 300 universe, like an add-on content pack for a video game.__"300: Rise of an Empire" is a bloodbath and not much else.__With its slo-mo ultraviolence, gushers of blood, impressive 3-D effects, homoerotic subtext, and self-important plot, this is a fan boy's fantasy, a four-star wonderment.__The naval collisions and melees play out in panel-like renderings that are bold and satisfying for the first half-hour but lack the momentum and bombastic je ne sais quoi of "300."__Murro may believe that he's directed an anti-fascist movie, but what he's really made is almost as coercive as fascist melodrama. It's a big bully of an action film.__The spectacularly brutal fighting is the film's main calling card, and in that "Rise of an Empire" doesn't disappoint.__For anyone looking for a sense of script (forget plausibility), Empire is a Trojan horse.__"Rise of an Empire" may strike some as an improvement on the first film, if only for two reasons: naval warfare and the glorious absurdity of Eva Green.__The slow-motion battle scenes are technically impressive and occasionally elegant, but there's enough machismo here to choke a thousand NFL locker rooms.__"Rise of an Empire" is no fun at all - even those famous six-pack abs from "300" seem to be missing a can or two in this desperate attempt to up an already dubious ante.__A plotless montage of anonymous bodies.__"300: Rise of an Empire" plays like a collaboration between the Marquis de Sade and Michael Bay. Or maybe the History Channel and the "Saw" franchise.__The film winds up looking like an ashen video game. It's even more muddy in IMAX and 3-D.__Green is fun to watch - she always is - but there's a point at which the caricature becomes the career, and that point is drawing closer.
Teenagers are getting it in the neck again, in the latest dystopian Young Adult literary sensation to get the Hollywood treatment.__It's all familiar territory, but it's realized with flair.__I think I have a touch of apocalepsy -- excessive sleepiness caused by prolonged exposure to three- and four-part series in which adolescents rebel against oppressive governments represented by esteemed actors.__Is the true enemy this all-testosterone Lord of the Flies clan? Nah, faulting your fellow kids is so 1950s. For the millennials, adults gotta be to blame__Having not read the book, I was hoping for a more satisfying payoff than the one I got. Then again, maybe the filmmakers are saving the answers for the sequel.__The premise seems both smart and intriguing, but the film directed by Wes Ball bears many of the cruder markings of YA fiction.__It's bleak business, and as it hurries toward its explosive, expository conclusion, the film becomes nonsensical, too.__Teens should eat up this fantasy's scenery-chewing angst and doom, and the hopeful tale of survival and empowerment (to be continued in the inevitable sequel or sequels).__A well-acted and intelligent thriller/futuristic sci-fi romp.__Despite a strong opening and riveting first 45 minutes, The Maze Runner devolves into one of the weakest post-apocalyptic Young Adult movies to reach theaters in recent years.__Director Wes Ball and his outstanding young cast work unusually hard to counter the derivative feel.__It's burdened with banal dialogue and a laughably dumb endgame that squeezes the life out of its superior parts.__Gets the vision and the grit of the source material but finally feels more like a long trailer than an involving movie.__By keeping its cards so close, "The Maze Runner" remains compelling.__Ball is deft, though, at evoking claustrophobia of every kind, whether in the open-air prison of the Glade or the actual tight spaces of the Maze. And he elicits a hair-trigger performance from O'Brien.__"The Maze Runner" isn't based on a video game, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.__It does leave you wanting to see the next installment. And that's one special effect that very few YA movies ever pull off.__Sure, "The Maze Runner" unravels a few mysteries, but it spins even more. Thomas, as it happens, isn't the only one dying of curiosity here. As the closing credits roll, you likely will be, too.__Though it sometimes feels calculated and mechanical, it's also solid, well crafted and entertaining.__Is there room at the multiplex for yet another entry in the young adult/dystopia/survival genre? Those who hunger for more could do worse than "The Maze Runner," based on the first book in James Dashner's trilogy.
The director, Antoine Fuqua, relies on small details, which anchor the vigilante-as-saint myth in at least a minimal degree of reality.__Fuqua infuses The Equalizer with a low-key energy and is in no hurry to rush into things.__When was the last time you saw a lone hero stride toward the climactic killing ground in slow motion? Yesterday? An hour ago?__It gets sillier as it goes along, but it's never not entertaining.__I could have done without the barbed-wire noose and glass-shard fight on shattered mirrors. But I couldn't have done without Washington, who, like Liam Neeson, has reached a new cruising altitude as a leading man.__If The Equalizer is the hit it should be, it will give this veteran action star his very first movie franchise.__This is a kid's fantasy of how to be bigger and badder than anybody else. As for Washington, no doubt he now has his very own franchise.__More and better Equalizers will be welcome, just to watch Denzel finding new ways of getting even.__It scrapes together two gripping, closely observed acts before lobotomizing itself for an over-the-top final third that tips the needle from "Pleasure" to "Pleasure, Guilty, Shame on You!"__If audiences and star are so inclined, it's easy to see this premise and this character - a tough, taciturn gent burdened with regret and a very special skill set - going into Roman numerals.__If you skip it, you're missing one of the year's signal works of superior Hollywood craftsmanship.__This mini-genre has begun to feel more and more expendable.__Mr. Fuqua, while not the world's most subtle filmmaker, directs the action sequences with bluntness and clarity and effectively uses his star as an oasis of calm in a jumpy, nasty universe.__A tense thriller that also has more on its mind than the familiar genre constraints it operates under.__Fuqua's movie is just as dopey and creaky as the series.__We're given precious little story (or back story) from screenwriter Richard Wenk (The Expendables 2), but not much is needed for a tale this primal and an actor this watchable.__The whole movie turns into a slaughterhouse. The question isn't who wants it-box office action is assured-but who needs it?__The film runs long, at 131 minutes, but Denzel Washington, as ever, is the essence of cool.__Just having Washington in the title role elevates the film from a tired rerun - complete with (yawn) brutal Russian mobsters - to a rousing, crowd-pleasing take on a movie formula, like a forgettable pop song turned into a dizzying jazz solo.__Even drenched in blood and fake rain, this "Equalizer" leaves its star - and the audience - high and dry.
The film oscillates between glitzy existential horror and somber showbiz spectacle.__In a single sequence, Aronofsky combines creationism, Darwinian evolution, original sin, the end of days, and radical environmentalism.__For all the high-tech showmanship on display, this retelling of Noah and the Ark marks a serious effort to engage with the Old Testament as a literary text.__In some ways, Noah resembles one of those Kirk Cameron movies about the apocalypse, only with a better cast and more dazzling special effects.__Rock Transformers.__It's overlong and a times sluggish. The fights and battles, designed to give an epic fantasy feel to the movie, are grave miscalculations. And the overabundance of CGI often makes Noah look like a video game.__Darren Aronofsky's film about the Old Testament shipbuilder has been sparking controversy - but there's no denying that the Great Flood, digitized, is a pretty great flood.__Despite its flamboyant, and at times goofy, fantasy trappings, Noah is firmly anchored by the fierce moral intensity of Aronofsky's vision, which is, if anything, more Old Testament than the Old Testament itself.__It's a moving story. And the fact that [Aronofsky's] done his biblical homework makes it that much more so.__Noah is a movie about big ideas (environmentalism, heavenly obedience versus earthly love) and even bigger directorial ambitions (how to tell a personal story on the grandest of grand scales). But, in the end, it's also a disappointment.__Aronofsky and his cowriter, Ari Handel, have whipped up all this strife, and none of it works.__Aronofsky and his co-writer Ari Handel struggle to create authentic drama and so fall back on action-movie cliches.__W.H. Auden cautioned against those who "read the Bible for its prose," but after "Noah," perhaps the better warning is to look out for those people who read the Bible for its potentially profitable widescreen IMAX action scenes__What it lacks is fresh insight from Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel. Yes, it appears Noah was an early environmentalist, but is that enough of a contemporary notion to sustain a two-plus-hour drenching?__It grounds the biblical apocalypse in the here and now, tapping into the dystopian mood while retaining a sense of religious awe.__For the most part, it works.__Darren Aronofsky's Noah is the Old Testament on acid. It's the movie equivalent of Christian death metal. It's an antediluvian Lord of the Rings, fist-pumping, ferocious, apocalyptic, and wet - very wet.__It captures the torment of one chosen as an instrument by a vengeful Old Testament God, and it breaks a story of cosmic dimensions into brutally human terms.__One of the most dazzling and unforgettable Biblical epics ever put on film.__There's so much delusion and so much delight in "Noah" that I have trouble distinguishing one from the other, or determining whether its most outlandish flourishes qualify as mistakes or as strokes of genius.
The filmmaking is playful without feeling jokey, the narrative stuffed with fun complications.__Neeson, who brings enormous conviction to these late-career action roles, moves his big body through confined spaces ... with so much power that you expect him to rip out the seats.__Anyone planning to see Non-Stop should probably just go see it. This is one of those near-perfect, peeled-onion, airplane-hijacking thrillers in which each removed layer brings you closer to a single, happy tear.__Why demand logic of an action movie released in February, when audiences just want a nice, bumpy ride?__It's all fairly entertaining and eminently disposable.__The problem is that Non-Stop tries to be something it's not. It has one too many scenes that border on ludicrous, and the big reveal barely makes sense.__Neeson is such an eloquent hunk of Irish melancholy that he gives everything he does - snapping a neck or taking a drink of water - a classical gravitas.__"Non-Stop" spends so much time trying to outwit the audience it ends up outwitting itself.__Non-Stop gets increasingly far-fetched as the jet makes its way across the Atlantic.__"Non-Stop" is a crisp, efficient thriller that benefits greatly from the intangibles Neeson can be counted on to supply.__Non-Stop plays like what might happen if Michael Bay directed a screenplay developed for Alfred Hitchcock.__Everywhere you look there's someone fun to watch.__What it lacks in believability it makes up for in strong performances.__Non-Stop [is] an efficiently made exercise in airplane claustrophobia that takes off well enough but then crash-lands in the third act under the weight of its red herrings, improbability and plot twists.__Neeson does indeed have a very particular set of skills - in elevating the generic action thriller into guilt-free popcorn pleasure.__The movie's preposterous, complicated, and a fair amount of fun until it tries to make sense in the final ten minutes.__"Non-Stop" doesn't make any sense, but that's expected, uninteresting and incidental to the pleasures of a slow-season Liam Neeson release as diverting as this one.__What a waste of a great premise: a locked-room mystery at 30,000 feet.__"Non-Stop" may be a tad derivative -- you could call it "Sky Hard" -- and its ending crash-lands in more ways than one. When all its engines are firing, however, it's a heck of a ride.__What holds the movie together, and us in its thrall, is Mr. Neeson's big, often bludgeony presence.
Unlikely to convert any skeptics, but if they wander into the multiplex, they'll find that that the prettily photographed sermon goes down easily.__This is a big-tent Christian film that wriggles around a lot seeking to accommodate multiple varieties of religious experience, and ends up terminally infected with the virus of postmodern relativism.__A well-acted, family-friendly and timely movie for Easter audiences that is just as much about appreciating life on Earth as it is about what comes after.__There's no antagonist, no resolution, and no real climax - just a series of mildly charming scenes in which Colton shares heavenly knowledge while his family reacts with awestruck tears.__Kinnear does an excellent job of capturing Burpo's obvious dilemma and the turmoil he and his wife endure as they work through this critical time in the life of their family.__Whatever works.__One of the finest achievements of director Randall Wallace's smartly crafted family film is the way Todd Burpo becomes the story's most driven and sincere doubter.__Heaven is For Real stops feeling like a drama and more like an illustrated religious pamphlet.__The faithful should welcome it warmly. Others may come away unconvinced while appreciating the film's sincerity and lack of anti-secular axes being ground.__Preachy and pretty, "Heaven" is a classy-looking product with a vanilla flavor and a pastel palette.__We might have expected more from writer-director Randall Wallace, who brought us the Oscar-nominated "Braveheart." But the material is pretty cookie-cutter and more typical of an afterschool special.__Kinnear ... remains a consistent screen presence, even if the material he's been handed lately rarely matches his talents.__Unlike many of the features targeted to what Hollywood is calling the "faith audience," the movie is well-acted and shot, often thoughtful and (intentionally) funny.__What could have been merely a feel-good exercise in Eschatology Lite instead becomes a wholesome but also surprisingly tough-minded portrait of a man wrestling with his faith.__The images of heaven somehow diminish the impact of the boy's experience, perhaps because heaven is just too profound for anyone to film.__This heavy-handed movie is simply a sermon its makers think we all should hear.__It is the rapport between Kinnear and the boy that really holds the film together. They make the father-son relationship believable in a way that grounds "Heaven" and gives it some of its best moments.__Unfortunately, Heaven Is For Real isn't really a movie about religion so much as an attempt to appeal to the broadest possible audience of conservative evangelicals.__Although it has some serious flaws, it rises above genre fare, thanks to Greg Kinnear's intriguing performance and the work of a good cast.__Given its declarative title, "Heaven Is for Real" should have built a more convincing case.
The "action" here is Turing tinkering with his machine. Or simply thinking -- which, as Cumberbatch portrays it, is adventure of the highest order.__We go into a movie knowing that the subject was as genius or a hero, a martyr or titan. We should leave with a more nuanced understanding of who he was, his complexities and flaws.__This film about one of the past century's smartest humans at times treats its own audience like a classroom of remedial learners.__It's a film about drive, about imagination, and how brilliance thrives outside the mainstream. These are common enough themes given uncommon purchase in a film about a man who likely saved millions of lives by never fitting in.__[Cumberbatch's] whose portrayal of the British mathematician and WWII code-smasher is a feat of nuanced intelligence, a portrait of anguish with hints of arid humor. And, yes, arrogance.__Produced with a Masterpiece Theater eye for period detail, but also with a missionary's zeal to honor a wrongly dishonored man.__Cumberbatch is moviedom's man of the moment, and with this painfully human performance, the actor who has specialized in difficult geniuses finally cracks the code of compassion.__This film's overall success hangs on Cumberbatch and what is, to date, his finest performance on the big screen.__It would be hard to foul up the story of Alan Turing, and thankfully The Imitation Game doesn't.__While their careers include fine performances, Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley are so ambitious, so subtle and so intelligent as the protagonists of "The Imitation Game" that their earlier work feels light.__Turing may finally be getting what he deserves as the straightforward and well-acted The Imitation Game, featuring a strong performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing.__"The Imitation Game" is both an education and a pleasure - and another chance to revel in what Cumberbatch can convey in eloquent silence.__Unlike The King's Speech, which won a clutch of Oscars for its dull propriety and Masterpiece Theater vibe, The Imitation Game is vibrant and lively, engaging you on several levels.__Cumberbatch's finely calibrated performance helps bring to life one of history's lesser-known stories and most shameful injustices.__It's easy to see The Imitation Game as a triumph - after all, Turing accomplished what all the experts claimed was impossible - but it's equally apparent that underlying the triumph is a tragedy.__As uncomplicatedly likeable and effortlessly rootable as its main character and star, The Imitation Game ultimately wins at any easy game, when it could have risked - and revealed - so much more.__There's a film to be made about how government secrecy came spiraling out from Bletchley to conquer the future in which we now live, but "The Imitation Game" would rather give you a very good night at the movies.__A handsome and stirring film of Second World War ingenuity that also succeeds as cracking good entertainment.__This watchable biopic focuses on the Enigma project, mining drama from the gravity of the Nazi threat and laughs from the egghead hero's arch egotism and social ineptitude.__"The Imitation Game" leaves Turing's essential mysteries intact, but they will nonetheless find even the most public contours his story ripe with drama, excitement and deeply affecting resonance.
"As admirably cohesive as the story is, it's far surpassed by the wonderfully committed lead performances. Harking back to the rubber-face zaniness of his breakthrough years, Carrey elicits childlike wonder at his hyperactive expressions and movements."__I wish I could put as little thought into writing about Dumb and Dumber To as the Farrelly brothers did in making it.__Time can be cruel, especially to sequels.__The directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly cram the movie with puns and those kinds of sight gags. Almost none of them work.__I reckon four out of every five jokes played to silence at the preview screening. If Dumb and Dumber To were a live comedian, he'd have said, "Is this an audience or an oil painting?" He'd have left the stage in tears.__The majority of it isn't just dumb and dumber, or even crude and cruder. At nearly two hours, it's just dull - and duller.__Over all, the movie is just funny enough to make you wish it were much better than it is.__In a world of ISIS, Ebola, dwindling retirement funds and severe drought, somehow this film seems needed.__Dumb and Dumber To is mostly just a kick in the nuts, and not the good kind -- provided there is a good kind.__You know the way some mawkish dramas make you tear up unwittingly? This movie is the opposite of that: It's a laugh-jerker.__The film clearly aspires to (three) stoogery with these lojinks. And it still aims too low.__I laughed a lot at this movie, possibly even more than I did at the original film, which I enjoyed quite a bit.__The lengthy gestation period hasn't resulted in an appreciably upgraded experience.__What felt fresh in Peter and Bobby Farrelly's original "Dumb and Dumber," with the Carrey-Daniels dense duo channeling the Stooges and Jerry Lewis and something else entirely, feels strangely old-fashioned two decades later.__Everyone has piled into this dumber, sillier, more consistently funny reprise with an enthusiasm that's infectious, and not in a low-grade medical way.__The Farrellys are still not much interested in film as a visual medium, and when Lloyd and Harry aren't smacking each other or dropping their pants, you might as well be listening to a radio play.__Is this worse for Jim Carrey or Jeff Daniels? That's the sort of question that comes to mind while not laughing at "Dumb and Dumber To."__What may have been subversive and irreverent in 1994, now just seems vulgar, hateful and tone-deaf ...__A sequel as desperate, in its own "official" way, as the knockoff-brand origin story that previously besmirched the franchise name.__Dumb and Dumber To may not be quite as funny as the first one, but it's the funniest thing the Farrellys have made since.
The song selection and its presentation seems out of his control.__Even Sandy the dog looks like he's had enough.__The vigorous display of good feelings and comforting resolutions has an unusually effervescent sincerity, even if the rags-to-riches wish-fulfillment leaps over all the hard knocks.__A teeter-totter between O.K. and Meh.__Did I really just watch Foxx and Wallis do an entire musical number set inside a moving helicopter? I did, and I've never felt more embarrassed for two actors, mostly because Foxx seems embarrassed for himself.__Considering this musical has its roots in Depression-era American, Gluck's contemporary take on the material is eerily lacking in observations about the rich/poor divide in this country.__In all the ways that matter it's a missed opportunity to take a flawed musical and transform it into a powerful new myth with a particular African-American slant.__Despite any reservations about the music, it is a charming, lovely little movie.__Engaging characters, infectious melodies, suspense, drama and dance extravaganzas appeal to children of all eras. If only the powers that be behind the new Annie movie had kept this basic truth in mind.__Quvenzhane Wallis, the Oscar-nominated star of the trippy bayou indie Beasts of the Southern Wild, simply has to skip into a room - and into the frame - to light things up.__Leapin' lizards! The evergreen Broadway musical "Annie'' strays far from its Depression-era roots with truly dismaying results in this crass, charmless, tineared and lead-footed update.__A movie that coasts on a disturbing greed-is-good vibe. And one that looks strangely cheap doing it.__By the end, the movie resembles just another formulaic, family-friendly piece of product, one the kids will enjoy and you'll endure as it goes in the DVD player for the 40th time.__Banal, shallow and markedly cynical.__Where to begin in describing the awfulness of "Annie"?__Hard to believe the sun will come out tomorrow for the new "Annie."__Most remakes are unnecessary but Annie is a bigger offender than many.__Phenom Quvenzhane Wallis proves her Oscar nomination for Beasts of the Southern Wild was no fluke. As a modern-day Annie, Wallis shines with her sweet portrayal. However, her performance alone can't save the film from being a dim adaptation.__Most of the cast can't sing or dance, and Gluck, who co-wrote the screenplay, has no clue why this story has endured.__The cast would have been better served by a middle school production overseen by a creatively frustrated, inappropriately ambitious drama teacher than by this hacky, borderline-incompetent production ...
An impressively solid World War II movie of the kind they don't make anymore.__While these orgies of violence are staged with tense, gruesome precision, they don't convey much beyond what we already know. Namely, that war is hell. Message received.__Pitt, who at 50 still looks great with his shirt off, has the gruff charisma to play a dauntless soldier with killer courage and a vestigial streak of humanity.__It's an "unflinching" account of war -- "unflinching," in quotes, because every moment of the film is composed to grind your face into the muck and be proud of itself for doing so.__Pitt is at the top of his game, playing a man who has forgotten whatever he used to be and has wholly embraced his role in this war.__Led by Pitt, who sublimates his persona so deeply into Wardaddy that you can forget about his movie star baggage, the cast is exceptional.__"Fury" is literally visceral-a kind of war horror film, which is, of course, what good combat films should be.__This is an intense movie, with taut, expertly depicted tank battles and a believable sense of camaraderie among the characters.__In a sense, it succeeds too well in conjuring its own subject matter: heavy, mechanical, claustrophobic, and unrelenting.__Fury is irrefutably crafted. Over two hours long it is tense going, a sturdily acted affair. And yet.... As the author of this drama, Ayer has penned a work that takes us no place new or illuminating.__A fatalism unites all of Ayer's movies, even his best film, End of Watch... This is the first of his movies in which that fatalism culminates in a state of grace I've never experienced in a war film before.__Fury is a big step up in sophistication. Where it elevates itself from being merely a believably grimy, well-acted war drama is in its long and surprising middle act.__Fury is a war movie with balls of steel and marbles for brains.__Though much of Fury crumbles in the mind, the power of its best moments lingers ...__"Fury" is a brutal film that too easily celebrates rage and bloodshed to no clear end beyond ugly spectacle.__Fury presents an unrelentingly violent, visceral depiction of war, which is perhaps as it should be.__I couldn't help suspecting that there's a pornographic leer to it all, a savage glee.__Attention to details give Fury heft and value, as does solid acting, but Ayer seems to lose his resolve in two scenes that are straight out of a Sgt. Fury Marvel Comics episode, or maybe a Hollywood script rewrite.__If memorable war movies mean something to you, open that book to a new page and add "Fury" to the list. It belongs there.__War is hell. It's also relentless, unsparing, unsentimental and violent to the mind, body and soul. Fury conveys these truths with brute force and lean, precise drama.
The movie's principal intention is to make you laugh at a loser, and revel in scenes from which polite people would instinctively turn away.__It's obnoxious when it means to be comic, and excruciating when it wants to be moving.__It's a rambling, pointless and labored attempt to cash in on Ms. McCarthy's fan base without respect for any audience with a collective IQ of 10. And it's about as funny as a liver transplant.__McCarthy's performance of unself-conscious uncouthness celebrates the freedom to be undignified. And, still, it's being misused.__Tammy is an object lesson in the art of directing, which is all it would have taken to turn this near-miss into an instant classic. Though that may be true of most mediocre movies.__A lot of good actors are wasted in this film in bit roles, including Allison Janney, Sandra Oh, and Dan Aykroyd. The ones with bigger roles, like Mark Duplass and Kathy Bates, are wasted, too.__Tammy is a wince-worthy missed opportunity__Like a classic road comedy, this tends to drift from scene to scene rather than adhere to a strict plot; the movie revolves mostly around McCarthy, hilarious in her best performance to date.__Eventually the film does manage to find its own awkward way, with enough effective and less desperate jokes to smooth things over after the rocky start.__They have little feel for the technical side of filmmaking; the imagery is flat and the editing amateurish. Most shots seem held for a beat too long or too short, wreaking havoc with the comic rhythm.__It's often said for films of this sort that it's the journey that matters, not the destination. Unfortunately, in this case, neither is worth the price of admission.__The playful energy between McCarthy and her completely game co-star, Susan Sarandon is more than enough to keep the movie humming along.__[It] could be an artifact from some alternate universe: the creatures there resemble Earthlings but have an entirely different and debased idea of what's funny.__As a script it is uneven and tonally inconsistent - best as a brainless, gross-out comedy, less successful when striving for emotional poignancy.__It's just ... off.__This pastiche of sitcomy episodes never gels into a plot.__[The material] requires a light touch that sometimes eludes Falcone. But the intention is admirable, as is the focus on flawed female characters and the way they relate to each other.__[McCarthy] has the potential to be so much more. She can't be a whole lot less than she is in "Tammy."__McCarthy bum-rushes the role like John Candy with a sour, combative disposition, reacting to every humiliation and rejection with feisty hostility.__"Tammy" is a bummer, not least because McCarthy's fans know she's better than this.
Quality is often irrelevant in a horror movie; shock is the key.__The script, by Gary Dauberman, is a cliched mess, lacking humor and surprises. But Leonetti stages some fright-worthy sequences ...__What about this movie is supposed to scare us?__What we mostly get in Annabelle is what we've gotten from so many other horror films: creaking floors, funky white-robed figures, home appliances that go off on their own, mysterious writing that shows up in mysterious places.__Annabelle, an effective prequel to horror pastiche The Conjuring, surpasses its predecessor simply by virtue of occasionally being scary.__Although [Leonetti] covers no new ground - things are largely predictable - he pays tribute to horror classics such as "Rosemary's Baby."__As undistinguished, uninteresting, and unscary as the worst of the Chucky films.__If you're sighing heavily at the thought of yet another stupid horror movie involving an evil doll, here's a pleasant surprise: Annabelle is actually rather decent at raising the goose bumps.__Laughworthy bumps in the night, creaky rocking chairs, a demon-infested basement and more gliding baby carriages than an '80s De Palma film.__Though it features a plucky female protagonist, "Annabelle" still possesses the same medieval attitude toward women as "The Conjuring," reducing the gender to the extremes of self-sacrificing mother and malevolent toy.__"Annabelle" works enough devil figurine juju to make for a modestly hair-raising prequel to the more satisfying scares of its predecessor, "The Conjuring."__Mr. Leonetti embraces the potential of negative space.__For a superior experience, go buy a disturbing-looking doll that says ''Don't go see Annabelle'' when you pull its string.__In horror, there really is nothing new left to discover under the devil moon, so the secret to startling audiences, or at least raising hairs on the backs of necks, lies in deft direction and editing, both missing here.__Where "The Conjuring" was more of a full meal. "Annabelle" just leaves you hungry for more.__Each time a character gets tossed in the air by some manifestation or another, the effect is cheesy. Still, I've seen worse.__A vortex of visual cliches beyond rescue.__While the film isn't clever or original, it is reasonably scary, especially when it knocks off the preliminaries and gets to the good stuff.__The story is a mishmash of demonic possession, Satanic killings, machines suddenly switching on and off and vacantly-staring figurines. It's more familiar than frightening. And the human actors are no more compelling than the poker-faced dolls.__The film is ultimately so generic and formulaic that you'll probably forget it by the time you get home.
What begins as a smoothly oiled romantic comedy quickly morphs into a clattery, grinding screwball contrivance.__The vapid story -- and its intended humor -- meanders and loses its way in predictable sit-com style.__For all its faults, there is a kind of genius in the way that it takes the rom-com raison d'etre - the desire to see two lovable people fall in love with each other - and diverts it for its own purposes.__You can't shake the feeling that in a just world, all these women - even Kate Upton - would have better material than this.__Brutal.__No one knows which takes are funny and which aren't. More than once, all three women, especially poor Upton, are caught looking like they don't know what they're doing.__Granted it would be nice to have a ladies' night out at the multiplex, but no one need be this desperate.__Practically every gag in this movie, and there are scores of them, is milked dry. When the gags aren't very good to begin to with, this is a prescription for disaster.__This is more "feminish" than feminist, but arguably a tottering stiletto-heeled step forward.__While "The Other Woman" raises some thoughtful questions about independence, identity and the importance of sisterhood, ultimately it would rather poop on them and then throw them through a window in hopes of the getting the big laugh.__Thank goodness for Leslie Mann.__Has it come to this for director Nick Cassavetes?__"The Other Woman" plays like "The First Wives Club" crossed with an exceptionally well-groomed female version of "The Hangover" - which is to say, there's not much to it, but it's featherweight fun while it lasts.__So dumb, lazy, clumsily assembled and unoriginal, it could crush any actor forced to execute its leaden slapstick gags and mouth its crude, humorless dialogue.__My advice to guys? Step away from the vehicle, because "The Other Woman" is out of control and intent on running down a certain kind of male.__The only thing missing from this steaming casserole, in fact, is the one crucial ingredient: A sense of humor.__Cassavetes seemingly tries to sap any energy that Mann and Diaz give the film. Any time music kicks in, terrible filmmaking results, usually in montage form.__All three women are less watchable and amusing than Nicki Minaj as Carly's legal assistant Lydia.__A conceptually odious, stupid-to-the-bone enterprise ...__A coarse, rickety comedy.
Frantic and silly.__These penguins really are cute, the animation is consistently appealing, and the movie is obviously bound for megamoolah at the box office.__Thanksgiving is a time for family and for shirking work, and out of respect for both traditions-and in recognition that I am surely not in the movie's demographic sweet spot-I'm handing the heavy lifting over to my kids, Tom (11) and Alexandra (9).__"Penguins of Madagascar" is a passible, inoffensive addition to DreamWorks Animation's canon, even if there's a faint whiff of a North Wind spin-off sullying the contained story.__Directors Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith keep up a headlong pace -- if one joke or sight gag misfires, there'll be another one soon.__Leaving the cute to the bigger kids on the block, with this movie, Dreamworks is opting for pure crazy. And sure enough, the strategy, this time anyway, has paid off in the most unnatural dividend imaginable: darned if these penguins don't fly.__Penguins of Madagascar aims primarily for the kiddies, racing from one frenetic action sequence to another like some haywire Walter Lantz cartoon.__You have to respect a kids' cartoon that kicks off with a Werner Herzog joke - even one so willfully, wondrously stupid and lighthearted as Penguins of Madagascar.__The pacing is so zany, the jokes are so rapid-fire and the sight gags are so inspired that it's impossible not to get caught up in the infectious energy of it all.__While "Madagascar"'s young faithful will likely get the most out of this flick, even they are likely to find they prefer these penguins in smaller doses.__May the sequels commence.__It may be a case of damning with faint praise to say that Penguins of Madagascar never really gets a chance to bore, since it never slows down.__If Penn-wings of Madagascar has a certain machine-made feel about it (and it does), that doesn't mean attention hasn't been paid to the animation.__Plays like a sampler of Dreamworks Animation's worst creative impulses: sugar-rush pacing, pandering meta-gags, and a slick, flavorless animation style.__Penguin power! Submit to it. Resistance is futile.__Passable entertainment if you're 7. Otherwise, frenzied and aimless.__However, even with all of well-intentioned references and good humor, Penguins doesn't break new ground. The film is fun, light-hearted fare that could be watched in the comfort of a long car ride to Grandma's house.__The story, like everything else, tries to do too much. It's an origins story, a mission impossible, a coming-of-age saga, a revenge story.__Beyond some imagery, we don't get much that's bigger or better than on TV. Nothing narratively richer, certainly.__All the glossy, kinetic animation and inventive action sequences get lost in the gag machine. The film throws jokes out like a tennis-ball machine on the fritz: gross humor, slapstick pratfalls, bizarre non sequiturs.
The chillingly gung-ho darkness that Johnson lends his comic riffs would be the story, if only the director, Luke Greenfield, didn't play the movie solely for laughs, which are few and far between.__This notion might have worked perfectly well in sketch form, but stretched out to feature length - in a film that's overlong at nearly two hours - it grows thin, repetitive and wearying.__Let's be clear: No one should choose this movie. It's a title in search of a plot. It could also have been called Let's Be Funnier, Let's Be Directed, Let's Be 15 to 30 Minutes Shorter, Let's Be 22 Jump Street.__"You've been watching too many movies," says a detective (Andy Garcia) during an interrogation in "Let's Be Cops." The same could be said for the filmmakers, who hit predictable beats in this disposable comedy.__None of this is as riotously zany as it wants to be.__Let's earnestly hope there is no sequel.__Johnson and Wayans are both gifted comic performers but are given way too little to do in a film that wends its way from set piece to set piece, not with antic glee but desultory and-then-this-happens randomness.__As a film, Let's Be Cops glides in the same way its characters do. Though it charms, it's difficult to ignore how many times we've seen this story played out before.__Let's Be Cops has its moments, but it in no way distinguishes itself.__A ridiculous comedy whose greatest sin is one of omission: a lack of humor. And that's a hard one to forgive.__The only truly lethal weapons in the criminally unfunny action comedy "Let's Be Cops'' are the lame script, putrid direction and pair of sitcom stars mugging nonstop in frantic pursuit of laughs that have fled over the state line.__Let's not and say we did.__At times, the movie seems to exist for no other purpose than to collide these two personalities together, privileging their antagonistic banter above all else. But isn't that the basic point of all buddy comedies?__The promising tang of something anarchically amusing is in the air, which makes the rote, slipshod and unfunny rest of the movie all the more dispiriting - like a drug that's as much fun as precinct paperwork.__You have the right to remain silent and, for much of "Let's be Cops," you will be.__More often than not feels more like a court-ordered defensive-driving class than a rousing high-speed chase.__Sporadically hilarious funny business.__None__None__None
We may have gained something in humor by not taking the saviors in the art-rescue story very seriously, but we've lost just about all of the romantic pleasures of heroism.__The movie does a good job of illustrating why protecting art from the Nazi scourge was important but it's far less effective fleshing out the personalities of the people who did the protecting.__A frustratingly flat film that drifts from moment to moment with a curious lack of urgency and an overbearing sense of self-importance.__If The Monuments Men never overcomes its unwieldy structure and unevenness of tone, the film still manages to make a profound, even subtle point: that Hitler's darkest impulses and annihilating reach extended from human beings to history itself.__This is a sturdy, old-school, big-scale Greatest Generation war movie. It's great escapism.__Think of them as Inglorious Art Historians. Only this PG-13 entertainment has little of the edge, however complicated, of Quentin Tarantino's 2009 Holocaust revenge flick.__It's like an over-the-hill gang variant on The Dirty Dozen, except not as much fun as that sounds.__Clooney's movie is a slow-witted, occasionally agreeable retread of numerous WWII band-of-brothers flicks its director no doubt watched on TV as a 1970s teenager.__This is a solid albeit slow-building film with few dull moments.__I can't think of another movie that feels as simultaneously rushed and leisurely.__In The Monuments Men, director George Clooney takes a wild, stranger-than-fiction true story and turns it into a dull, prestigious slog.__The high-minded message about preserving Western civilization often feels at odds with the movie's half-hearted heist-flick approach.__Clooney's obviously going for old-school charm and camaraderie here, but the first half of the film is so scattered, and the characters are so lacking in specifics, that a sense of group bravado never feels earned.__Alas, it's a throwback that's thrown its back out - limping along, trailed by battalions of stereotypes and ammo rounds of cliche.__There's lots of information, some nice images, plenty of earnest sermonizing about culture and almost no suspense, or tension, or character development, or structure. Or, well, art.__At times, this fact-based film feels like a breezy heist flick, while at others it's a somber tribute to the sacrifices of war. The two tones don't harmonize, and they never ring true.__Earnest and well-intentioned but ultimately inert, "The Monuments Men" talks a better game than it can deliver.__Despite its intrinsically fascinating subject matter and winning cast, The Monuments Men is no treasure.__Because Mr. Clooney can't figure out what kind of story this is, he too often slips into pandering mode, including in his own performance, which is filled with too many smiles and speeches.__Alexandre Desplat's intrusive score keeps telling us what mood we should be in. Moods change from moment to moment, though, and not only in the action sequences.
Everything Guardians of the Galaxy gets right with its mix of action and comedy, Hercules botches.__The story is fairly straightforward, and, more importantly, so is much of the action.__The battle scenes, though rousing, fall short of epic. But it's reliably fun to watch - up until the brutish, smudgy conclusion ...__It simply fails to exploit its assets: an amusing, revisionist take on the mythological strongman, and the charisma of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.__"Hercules" heaves and grunts along, interrupted by battle scenes that are visually impressive (when's the last time you saw someone pick up a horse and throw it?) but emotionally uninvolving.__The movie is plagued by a split identity: It's half-slog, half-Mel Brooks.__A big-budget misfire of a sizeable order, a visually busy but emotionally dead endeavor that wearies the viewer with endless computer generated special effects while failing to provide a scintilla of human interest.__A surprisingly satisfying blend of action, adventure and swift plotting.__Give "Hercules" this much: It knows what it is.__A scaled down club-and-sandals movie with a good ratio of scenery-chewing to choppy-shutter-angle skull-cracking.__Hercules might seem like the perfect role for The Rock, but the movie really needs a better Dwayne Johnson.__The results are canny, fast-paced, and, for what the film attempts to accomplish, enjoyable.__The point of leaving the Rock behind was to keep Johnson out of stuff like this and to take more risks, like the juiced-up idiot crook he played in Pain & Gain.__Fast-paced, funny, and packed with - to indulge in a bit of ad-speak -eye-popping action.__Pulpy, self-consciously subversive, above-average summer entertainment ...__Ratner's sense of humor is never clever, or light, and I've hated my share of his earlier films, but not this one.__Dwayne Johnson, perhaps the only actor around who can look superhuman and self-deprecating at once, wears the title role like a custom tailored lion skin.__Hercules has no right to be as entertaining as it is.__Johnson was born for this kind of kick-butt-with-a-smirk role. In one scene, he appears to throw a charging horse over his shoulder, and it somehow doesn't look hokey.__There's just enough plot to keep the movie lurching forward, and there are plenty of battle scenes to delight connoisseurs of carnage.
For most of the film, returning writer-director James DeMonaco favors gore and shock inserts of music over the edgy, nasty parody for which the material seems ready made.__DeMonaco is more interested in scenarios than in stocking them with human beings. Everybody here is a backstory in a T-shirt.__Grillo's performance will make you wonder why he didn't start headlining movies like this before turning 50; his is the soft-spoken kind of charisma that helped make half of the Expendables into stars back in the '80s and '90s.__The Purge: Anarchy is basically a slasher movie in which society is the deranged killer. It plays like it's already a grindhouse classic - dark, dirty, and disreputable.__"The Purge: Anarchy" is more in line with what people going to a "Purge" movie would want out of a "Purge" movie.__An equally effective, deliciously disturbing movie.__It is better than the first film in almost every way but that doesn't mean it's appreciably smarter or has appeal to those who like meat on their action-oriented bones.__Government-sanctioned mayhem continues unabated in the follow-up to last year's surprise hit The Purge, but the wickedly satiric sense of humor that made the original worth watching is nowhere to be found.__It's the plotting, including a number of unexpected twists and turns throughout, that raises the film above the expected blood fest and for that, we must be grateful.__Make no mistake, a good "Purge" does not equal a good movie, but the post-apocalyptic thriller is slightly more interesting because it takes itself, and its menace, more seriously.__It's better-made than the first -- DeMonaco's writing and directing are much stronger -- and it also has the courage of its convictions.__[A] satisfyingly creepy, blunt, down-and-dirty thriller, one of those follow-ups that improves on the original.__The Purge: Anarchy efficiently exploits its high-concept premise while delivering far more visceral thrills than its predecessor.__The film wants to have it both ways: It mixes sanctimonious commentary about violence and socioeconomic claptrap with grand depictions of violent assaults and terror on cue.__Writer/director James DeMonaco combines potent action, sledgehammer political allegory and eerie paranoia in an entertaining B movie.__"The Purge: Anarchy" obeys a cardinal law of Hollywood: Shoot first and ask questions later.__While the film is rutted with plot holes, lapses in logic and tin-eared dialogue - the obvious is stated again and again - it falls squarely into a category that used to be called B movies.__"The Purge: Anarchy" is a dirtied-up breath of fresh air, an old-school exploitation movie that does what it sets out to do.__You'd expect the sequel to be an improvement based on production values alone, and you would be right, but not by much.__The central premise remains as patently absurd as ever in this noisy, self-serious sequel to James DeMonaco's surprise 2013 hit.
Like the source material, this is one terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day that families just might find themselves revisiting often.__It's funny, fast, and charming.__Arteta keeps the action speeding along while eliciting spot-on performances. Carell is at his discombobulated best, and Garner anchors the proceedings with aplomb.__This is where the comedy comes from: that lurking fear that even the most routine of daily domestic tasks is just a spilled coffee cup away from disaster.__"Alexander" won't change your day, but it's not terrible, horrible, no good or very bad, either.__It's a film where you start chuckling as soon as someone says something like, "I just want everything to be perfect tonight."__What the filmmakers come up with is a modestly likable mix of zany and gently warmhearted, even if they overdo both elements at times.__Not so terribly horrible. Not so terribly terrific either.__The latest example of a wonderful children's book turned into a mediocre movie.__Director Miguel Arteta, who's previous work is a mixed bag of television and film, gets almost everything right here, including bringing together a solid cast ...__While the laughs are predictable, this is sweet family fare.__Just another loud, boy-centric comedy aimed at 'tweens.__Stretches the book thinner than pizza dough and feels about as nutritious. Still, its intentions are good and so is its cast ...__A nice, pleasant, not bad, perfectly fine movie.__Miguel Arteta directs with a deft hand, and the performances charm.__Even the bathroom humor is forgivable when the end result is a crowd-pleasing comedy and a surprisingly entertaining treat for the whole family.__A pleasant, entertaining way to spend just under 90 minutes, particularly if accompanied by children.__It turns out the film is not terrible or horrible or very bad. No good? Not that, either.__Alexander is a watchable, affable, pretty good, well-done kids' movie buoyed by a humorous script and talented cast.__The movie is so over-the-top that it makes little narrative sense, but it's often successful in its naked pursuit of belly laughs.
You want eye-rolling moments? This movie will detach your corneas.__Hart has to deliver a spectacular highlight every time he touches the ball for this movie to have any chance, and as a result, he takes some ill-advised shots.__Think Like a Man, Too is mostly uninspired and insipid, but it rallies, and builds up enough comic steam by the end that you might find yourself amused.__We're still being fed ensemble movies with a dozen good actors that don't let them do enough.__Freed from its ties to the source material - the first film was inspired by a Steve Harvey self-help book - Think Like a Man Too borrows liberally but in a definite PG-13 fashion from The Hangover, hitting on every required Vegas touchstone.__It's intermittently fun, and funny, but after a while it's just so much swinging back and forth. We get it. You're up. You're down. You're back up again.__Everything about this film smacks of laziness.__This is the sort of film that only makes sense as a rental - with, perhaps, a couple of friends, and a very generously mixed pitcher of margaritas.__When it comes to wisdom about marriage - well, as Henny Youngman might have said, "Take this movie. Please."__Things turn loud and desperate and stay that way, and the moral seems to be: Whatever you do, don't act like a man, because that means unjustified bravado, whoop-it-up antics and adolescent humor.__It's tamer than you would expect - and hope.__Hart hits such adrenaline-fueled extremes it's exhausting.__As bland and anonymous in practice as it is on paper.__The only reason I'd Think again is the return of Kevin Hart, who mines comic gold out of sloppy seconds.__True, the stereotypes remain in "Think Like a Man Too," but the actors get a chance to bring them to life, and I even found myself warming to, or at least occasionally laughing at, Hart's relentlessly clownish shtick.__It's everything the first movie wasn't: noisy, clumsy and derivative.__It's amateurish but gleeful. The zoom-zoom pacing and all-in performances make sure the jokes don't fall on dead air.__Think Like a Man Too might have been more accurately titled "Think Like the Most Hackneyed Rom-com Team Around.''__Unlike How to Train Your Dragon 2, which gives us characters older, wiser, and more experienced than they were in the previous movie, Too pretty much reprises all the conflicts from last time.__A gathering of a large group of friends can be energetically fun or crazy loud. "Think Like a Man Too" is thankfully more the first of those, though it's not afraid to be the second one either.
'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is spectacular.__This is the first portrayal of God I've ever encountered who looked like he could use a good spanking.__Crowd-wowing CGI spectacle and the inevitable if inconsequential 3-D effects make Exodus look like pure product, without any defining vision.__Exodus: Gods and Kings is as uneven as Ridley Scott's career; at times, it seems to be a journey through the director's greatest strengths and weaknesses. The good news is that his strengths eventually win out ...__The screenplay (credited to four screenwriters) is a mess, the pacing is uneven, the acting is inconsistent, and the experience as a whole is a letdown.__While the pale skin tones (bronzer is selectively applied) and haphazard mix of American and British accents is distracting, it barely scratches the surface of Exodus's ungainly artificiality.__A mish-mash - part half-committed melodrama, part half-thought-out political provocation.__"Exodus" is an exercise in visual trickery that reaches for nothing beyond the obvious.__Computer-generated imaging has advanced spectacularly over the decades, but moviegoers, and gamers, have been there every step of the way. Miracles aren't as impressive as they used to be.__An even better special effect would have been having a main cast that actually reflects the Mediterranean/North African desert environment...There are darker-skinned actors on the screen, though they just happen to be all slaves, servants and soldiers.__An utterly clueless, relentlessly grim and rambling action epic guaranteed to displease devout Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, amuse atheists - and generally bore everyone.__"Exodus: Gods and Kings" does a fair job of giving us what might be called The Second-Greatest Story Ever Told. What it never convinces us of is why.__"Exodus" is ludicrous only by accident, which isn't much fun and is the surest sign of what we might call a New Testament sensibility at work. But the movie isn't successfully serious, either.__This is spectacular entertainment, practically a theme park ride, that could have used more spirituality and soul.__Director Ridley Scott ticks the visual "epic" box with Exodus: Gods and Kings, but leaves emotion in the dust by trading spectacle for a compelling story.__Admirably cogent, even colloquial, Exodus plows through its stages efficiently, methodically and without much Old Testament passion.__"Exodus" turns out to be part of a time-honored tradition: the old-fashioned, super-spectacular Hollywood bomb.__It's understandable that people were angry about the whitewashing of Egypt. But no aspiring actor of color should think of this as an opportunity missed so much as a bullet dodged.__Moses is imagined as if Scott met him on an awkward first date.__Scott is nothing if not a master orchestrator of chaos, and, both intentionally and otherwise, "Exodus: Gods and Kings" offers plenty of that.
Pretty much everything in this South Korean co-production is slightly undercooked, lacking the same degree of sprightly wit or dramatic punch regularly found in A-list studio product.__The whole thing looks like a video game you'd rather not play.__The bottom line: Kids may be mildly amused by The Nut Job, but adults accompanying them won't find much to capture their interest.__The Nut Job is a delightfully goofy slapstick cartoon with a surprisingly dark heart.__Only a multilevel chase sequence involving Surly and some glowing-eyed street rats has any real kinetic excitement, and the supporting characters lack visual distinction.__"The Nut Job" features muddy-colored and often ugly animation, a plot that feels too stretched out and loaded with details to hold the attention of most children, and more flatulence jokes than anyone deserves.__When the story gets stale, the movie inserts a "nuts" pun or, worse, resorts to a gas or burp joke. It doesn't work the first time, nor the fifth.__Once Surly and Buddy case the joint, develop a plan, and deal with the inevitable surprises, The Nut Job could be any classic caper flick.__That feeling of been-there-done-that is pervasive, with many of the jokes sounding like they were ripped off from other movies.__The Nut Job features decent CG animation, especially of animals, but the writing isn't particularly clever, relying on obvious puns and slapstick humor.__Spins its wheels like rodents in a Habitrail.__Someone spent a lot of time making the architecture and production design match the era. Grandparents getting dragged to "The Nut Job" will be appreciative.__The overall mood resembles a furry, nut-based version of Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing."__Grotesquely wrongheaded.__"The Nut Job" fights its protagonist's own charmlessness from the first scene. Turning a dislikable leading character a little less dislikable by the end credits sets an awfully low bar for this sort of thing.__The burnished backgrounds are pleasant to look at, but finding something to savor in the story is a tough nut to crack.__The cartoon is stuffed with exhausting visual mayhem. Some jokes land, but most kids over 10 will roll their eyes.__Relentlessly awful.__Every beat of the story is a watered-down, jokeless version of previous children's films ... The Nut Job seems designed to trick misinformed parents into plopping down money to occupy their children for just over an hour.__The small-town setting of a half-century ago is beautifully animated by director Peter Lepenotis and his team, and there are some nicely staged old-school action sequences.
Despite the campus setting, little about the story is intelligently designed.__Even by the rather lax standards of the Christian film industry, God's Not Dead is a disaster.__The film is slickly produced, with a competent cast, and although it sometimes stacks the deck shamelessly in defense of its credo, it does allow a few dissenting voices to slip into the debate.__The Almighty deserves better advocacy than he gets in this typically ham-fisted Christian campus melodrama.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Aimed at a devotional middle-American audience, this never risks the sort of individual perspective necessary to bring the story to life onscreen, for good or ill.__At best, this version succeeds as a Sunday school supplement. But the blandness is enough to make you long for Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.__People will always want to spend money for this sort of thing, even if they've already seen it. And in this case, they've literally already seen it.__The film goes wild with helicopter shots of Jesus and his followers traveling through the hills. Who knew Christ was lord of the rings?__The target evangelical audience may well respond enthusiastically, but, unless your own salvation is riding on it, the film is mostly a slog.__This is more a pageant than a story about characters and their motivations; it's as brusque in its storytelling as an illustrated children's bible, which would at least offer some mystery and grandeur in the composition of its images.__By playing it so safely reverential, Son of God tends to plod its way to Calvary, begging to be discussed among Bible study groups and positively name-checked in the Sunday sermons.__They have turned the Christ saga into cheese. As in cheesy.__The film is willing. But its spirit is weak.__Never again will a Sunday school student get lower than a C-minus on this material.__The two-hour film condenses about four hours of what already was hasty television, and it all winds up a little dramatically static.__It's a movie that embraces the nearly pedagogical predictability of lines like "Where's Judas? You seen him?" or "Thomas, stop doubting."__Son of God takes no real chances, opting for a moderately involving re-telling of an oft-told story.__The condensed "Son of God" tries to relay the messianic story plain and simple.__The movie feels duty-bound to stay absolutely faithful to its sacred source material. It's the classic dilemma of the proselytizer: How far into the secular world can you go to deliver your message?__A film that is almost invariably heavy-handed and obvious from beginning to end ...__This stiff, earnest production plays like a half-hearted throwback to the British-accented biblical dramas of yesteryear, its smallscreen genesis all too apparent in its Swiss-cheese construction and subpar production values.__Considering just how popular Jesus is, you'd think he'd get better treatment__He walks on water, heals the sick and raises the dead. But not even Jesus can transform "Son of God" into a compelling epic.__Don't expect to see a great film, or even a very good one.
"The Grand Budapest Hotel" is not his grandest work yet, but it is one worth an extended stay.__I like Anderson when he's making movies about childhood -- "Rushmore," or "Fantastic Mr. Fox" -- but when he ventures into the realm of adulthood, he seems out of his jurisdiction.__Grand isn't good enough a word for this Budapest Hotel. Great is more like it.__Anderson's films are too precious for some, but for those of us willing to lose ourselves in them, they're a delight. "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is no different, except that he has added a hint of gravitas to the mix, improving the recipe.__The movie is a flume ride through the imagination of one of the most creative minds making movies today, and the pleasure curls your toes. Also, be ready to crave some macaroons.__"Budapest" is pretty much an old-fashioned screwball comedy garishly dressed. It's goofy, eccentric and often downright silly. There are many scenes that would have worked in a "Three Stooges" movie.__After feeding on this sweet buffet, sated cinephiles will want to call the front desk to extend their stay.__In its own silly, artificial way, it's the first Anderson film to acknowledge the existence of a world outside its own little toy box and to ground its characters' nostalgia in something resembling actual historical reality.__The comedy in The Grand Budapest Hotel is among the broadest yet undertaken by Anderson. But amid the frenzied hubbub, there are intimations of a darker, sadder history unfolding.__If a movie can be elegantly zany, this wholly imaginative, assured fable of a legendary concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), his protege Zero (Tony Revolori) and the murder of a countess, is it.__From the start, it's clear Anderson is working with a new sophistication both in the vocabulary and structure of the film's voiceover narrations.__The Grand Budapest Hotel is by far the most headlong comedic affair in Anderson's canon. It's practically Marx Brothers-ian at moments. And Fiennes - who knew he was capable of such wicked, witty timing?!__It's quintessential Anderson, in other words, but also an unabashed entertainment. And that's something to see.__Playing an Old World charmer with clipped diction and a deliciously foul mouth, Fiennes, making his debut with Anderson's stock company, falls into lockstep with the filmmaker's unmistakable universe.__With "The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson is up to his old tricks but with a magnanimous new confidence that feels like a gift.__The entire movie is like a giant, elaborately decorated cake, created by this most exacting of film craftsmen. And how tasty it is!__[Anderson's pictures are] comical without actually being funny, inventive without being freely playful, momentous without being dramatic. The emotional oxygen that would ignite them gets smothered in self-conscious cleverness.__The tender friendship between the wide-eyed Zero and the worldly Gustave gives this movie an emotional core that isn't always an Anderson priority.__I would call "The Grand Budapest Hotel" major whimsy. It's a confection with bite, featuring an ensemble led by the invaluable Ralph Fiennes, here allowed to exercise his farceur's wiles.__The movie's sad undertone saves "The Grand Budapest Hotel" from its own zaniness - or better yet, elevates the zaniness, making it feel like an assertion of some right to be silly, or some fundamental human expression.
Surveying the peculiar array of 1980s retreads clustered into release this week, I'm reminded of Marty McFly in Back to the Future Part II, traveling forward in time 30 years to discover that everything is still the same, only worse.__Padilha is Brazilian, and it's interesting that both RoboCops have been made by men whose non-Hollywood work focused on their respective countries' curdled politics.__This Robo-reboot tries fiercely to update the satirical punch and stylistic perversity Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original. It's a futile gesture.__Cynical, boring, PG-13 retread.__Neither Alex Murphy's internal moral conflict nor the larger, vaguely satiric portrait of a global culture dependent on high-tech law enforcement seem to be the main point of this Robocop remake, which raises the question of what is meant to be the point.__It's well made, polished, and hits every mark - but is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun?__It fully justifies its existence. That doesn't mean it's especially good. But it's a rare "reboot" that transcends its studio's money-grubbing. It has some Big Ideas.__An action adventure that's graphics-rich, logic-poor, coherence-challenged and pleasure-impaired.__I would advise anyone with fond memories of Paul Verhoeven's movie to cross the street and avoid seeing this flimsy facsimile.__I'll take the original any day, but this is still fun, and the cast is first-rate.__RoboCop becomes less a work of aspirational coolness and more a piece of political satire - and not necessarily a bad one.__There are some interesting things about "RoboCop," and - no, wait, that's a lie.__It retains the central ideas and themes of the original while updating and rearranging the narrative to lose a derivative feel.__The film has lots of energized mayhem, and Murphy's unraveling of the conspiracy against him isn't dumbed down, yet it's as if the comic-book action poetry of the original has been encased in a suit of generic armor.__With a host of others, Padilha and screenwriter Joshua Zetumer concoct a bubbling stew of terror-streaked social satire and teary domestic drama.__A kinder, gentler RoboCop. What scares us in 2014 isn't that we could someday make a robot Murphy. It's that we probably already can.__It's all rather surprisingly well acted (Kinnaman and Oldman are better than they even need to be), but "RoboCop" is missing a crucial ingredient: fun.__The re-imagined crime, action, sci-fi thriller isn't going for the biting satire of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original, or its extreme violence. The sci-fi side hasn't evolved much. And the thrill? Well, most of the thrill is gone.__At least offers something resembling ideas of morality and mortality in the guise of a silly shoot-'em-up, even if those ideas are eventually given short shrift.__Compared to the humor in the "Iron Man" movies or the vigilante themes in the recent "Batman" series, this reboot&#65279; has little to offer.
[Evans] carries Untold by admirably fulfilling the two essential functions of a period-movie hero: to enunciate comic-book dialogue with Shakespearean authority and to look great with his shirt off.__Most of the time, I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls.__The idea is to humanize one of the most fearful monsters in the Western crypt. But Dracula Untold goes way overboard, past domestication and into canonization.__A generic vampire tale in the Underworld vein that comes closer to the infamous Van Helsing than a memorable re-interpretation of a legendary monster.__The movie is the latest multiplex filler to co-opt a classic tale only to drown it in computer-generated murk. Even the title has the ring of something created by committee.__It's not so much untold as rewritten - if not by J.R.R. Tolkien than by some clever 12-year-old overstimulated by "The Lord of the Rings."__Whatever possessed the makers of Dracula Untold to think we'd be interested in a tragically unhip romance that backstories the infamous bloodsucker?__At times Dracula Untold flirts with dullness so much that it might as well just stick a stake in the heart of Bram Stoker's legacy.__This Vlad the Impaler has all the edge of Vlasic the pickle.__"Dracula Untold" feels longer than its 95-minute running time.__The weapons, Turkish helmets and Romanian interiors are all gorgeous. If only the rest of this "Lord of the Rings" wanna-be were at the same level.__The film's problems aren't limited to liberal cadging from comic books. In fact, that's precisely what's best about the film, which occasionally boasts gorgeous visuals. But the movie doesn't know when to stop stealing.__Here we have a vampire movie that brings together elements from other more popular movies.__I don't want to oversell this film. But in an era in which we've seen a lot of failed attempts to reinvent classic fantasy tales as CGI-action spectacles, it feels remarkably assured.__Neither the Dracula we need nor the one we deserve.__It falls into that far-too-large category of studio offerings that aren't good enough to be noteworthy or terrible enough to be truly entertaining.__If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself - and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes - then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?__It works neither as a sweeping historical epic nor as an action-horror hybrid.__And so it was, and so it was dull, the greatest villain in all cinema bitten on the neck and drained of his hottest blood.__Much like the recent, widely reviled I, Frankenstein, this misconceived project mainly signals a need to go back to the drawing board.
'Horrible Bosses 2' is so lazy it's not even about horrible bosses.__Horrible Bosses 2 has ditched its predecessor's universality, but kept its amiable good will.__Three years after its nauseating - yet popular - original installment, "Horrible Bosses 2" reunites the cast members in a juvenile, generic and outrageously funny sequel.__It's the small, tossed-off moments-Bateman's deadpan mugging, Day's frenzied cluelessness, and Sudeikis' smarmy one-liners-that land the best.__The follow-up's improbable story involves kidnapping -- 9 to 5, anyone? -- but the worst ransom will be paid by the bilked popcorn munchers who have to sit through this inane bungle of a budding cinematic franchise.__It's not really about bosses or office politics. Its only allegiance seems to be to the law of the sequel: It puts the same characters into a vaguely familiar situation, with diminishing, tepid returns. They should have just called it 2.__This is the sort of slapdash comedy in which characters get smarter or stupider from one scene to the next, depending on the script demands.__Director Sean Anders and his three co-writers go out of their way to up the profanity, vulgarity and absurdity of the first film, falling into the classic sequel trap of attempting to dirty-up and double-down on every laugh.__The Horrible Bosses comedy franchise is like a recipe full of ingredients that you'd think would go well together. But the taste ends up being off anyway.__This is strictly a by-the-numbers, squeeze-out-some-more-money sequel. And the worst thing is, the stars here didn't need any horrible bosses to drive them to do it. They did that all by themselves.__Not every joke hits its mark; maybe only even half of them hit. But the picture skips along briskly, thanks in part to its nimble editing.__Bateman has never been funnier on film, because the zingers he launches are bounced off of the oafish Sudeikis and the ferrety Day.__Horrible Bosses 2 goes for whatever cheap, vulgar gags it can collide into. Most unfortunate is the sex-crazed debasement of Aniston, who lights up the movie but suffers some of its lowest jokes.__Even at its lamest and most entitled, this sequel will most likely please fans of the first installment, chiefly because Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are, admittedly, often very funny together.__Every now and then a laugh breaks through the thick cover of mediocrity. But for the most part, it all falls flat.__Horrible Bosses 2 (emphasis on "horrible") is an apt title for this repugnant, unnecessary sequel.__"Horrible Bosses 2" is further proof that likable actors have to take an occasional sick day.__Cruder, dumber and far less funny than the original, which is saying something.__Make no mistake, despite some well-earned laughs, "Horrible Bosses 2" is not what qualifies as a good movie or even a particularly good R-rated comedy.__Duct tape, thick rope and the threat of being shot all figure prominently in "Horrible Bosses 2." All would have been required to keep me in my seat if it weren't my job to report back on this factory-issued sequel.
If the movie is high on gastronomy, it also redefines cooking with gas.__Linus Sandgren's camera caresses the cuisine like an ecstatic lover. It brought out the foodie in me.__Mirren's Madame Mallory unctuously oozes her dedication to perfection from every pore -- and it's truly delicious to watch her work her magic up on the screen.__Hallstrom, who also directed Chocolat, follows the foodie-cinema aesthetic by filming the dishes in a gleaming sumptuousness designed to make you famished.__Food porn with a sweet albeit predictable menu.__At its core, The Hundred-Foot Journey is a movie about good food, and one man's passion for cooking.__One of the characters, no doubt alluding to Proust, says, "Food is memories." Unfortunately, this is one movie about food that I'm forgetting already.__It's the movie version of comfort food. Except even in comfort food there's a difference between something made from scratch, and something that comes out of a box. And "The Hundred-Foot Journey" still tastes of powdered cheese.__It would be curmudgeonly to count all the ways in which The Hundred-Foot Journey is unsurprising, unrealistic, unnecessary.__The Hundred-Foot Journey is vintage Hallstrom - genial and meditative, focusing more on characters and emotions than an overcooked plot. The story is simple; the people inhabiting the movie make this worth seeing.__It's a rare delight to watch Puri and Mirren play off each other.__Awards material it's not, but the movie knows its intentions and audience, and cooks everything up into a satisfying meal.__If there is room for romantic fantasy in your life, this cinematic equivalent of comfort food goes down easy enough, and it's hard to begrudge it that.__Apart from the scenic location of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val and the equally enthralling shots of Indian and French cuisine, what remains is a pleasant if rather syrupy tale of clashing cultures.__"The Hundred-Foot Journey" is likely neither to pique your appetite nor to sate it, leaving you in a dyspeptic limbo, stuffed with false sentiment and forced whimsy and starved for real delight.__It must be said that it goes down rather well, although full enjoyment requires that all cynicism be left simmering on the back burner.__Overall, it's tough to grumble about such a sturdy and crowd-pleasing souffle.__A moving piece of food porn, The Hundred-Foot Journey is a familiar tale enlivened by some sensitive, sincere touches.__The folk-wisdom level is tolerable, just as the cliches and manipulations are palatable, because the story is full of life, and free of ironic additives.__Basically a promo reel for small-town France and Gallo-Indian food fusion. Anyone who requires a more substantial meal should eat before heading to the theater.
There should be something more exhilarating about the violent and hopeful epilogue finale than there is.__It's a little dumb (OK, maybe more than a little), but "No Good Deed" is an otherwise brisk, efficient thriller that won't punish audiences who drop in.__No Good Deed practically fetishizes the brutality Idris Elba's character inflicts on a number of women. It sexualizes him as a killing machine. It wants us to salivate over him and tremble before him simultaneously.__The final plot twist is about as fiendishly clever as an episode of General Hospital. Is that a spoiler? You're welcome.__With performers as strong as Henson and Elba, and the guidance of director Sam Miller, who's worked with Elba in a handful of Luther episodes, it should have yielded more. The trite third act reveal only further sours the wasted potential.__No Good Deed is an example of the worst kind of exploitative thriller.__A few scenes succeed in generating legitimate tension, but this movie isn't so much a nail-biter as a very occasional hangnail-chewer.__An inert "Cape Fear" rehash that can't seem to choose its favorite contrivance.__There aren't really any characters, at least none with any traits beyond "good" and "bad."__This one certainly doesn't go unpunished, at least for the audience.__Despite competent performances and packaging, dialogue and situations in Aimee Lagos' script are too routine to create much excitement.__It's certainly not good. But it's not entirely dire.__"it's entirely because of Henson's innate likability and charm that this film works at all."__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
More often than not ... "Selma" focuses on the one thing we don't expect in a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. - his doubts - and Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and quite brilliant performance.__This is a film about work: the work at hand, the work it takes to do the work, and, for an audience in 2015, the question of whether the work worked.__Vivid, nuanced and, yes, timely.__Like Dr. King did, the film captures your mind and your heart as it entertains, the way great movies often do.__An uneven yet generally skillful effort that has probably drawn more praise and criticism than it warrants.__This is what Selma dares to do so well: show us the small, private moments in King's life, the intimacies, the humanity.__As a film, Selma is solid if unspectacular. As a dramatic portrayal of recent U.S. history, however, Selma burns with a fierce intensity.__We see history as it unfolds, not as it has been encased in amber, in a movie that needs to be seen in these anxious days of renewed racial and cultural unrest.__The movie is riveting. It reminds us not only of how far we have come as a society but how far we have yet to go.__It may be coincidence that Selma reverberates with a particular timeliness...Still, it's thanks to director DuVernay and first-time features writer Paul Webb that the film has more than the luck of timing on its side.__What Daniel Day-Lewis did for Lincoln, Oyelowo does for King, mimicking his behavior and speech uncannily. He is both completely believable and someone we've never encountered before.__To see "Selma" is to feel and appreciate anew the burden of greatness.__In an era of comic-book movies, "Selma" is an impressive reminder of the real-life struggle for human dignity.__A somber and distressingly relevant tribute to King and his fellow compatriots in the civil-rights movement of the 1960s.__History becomes breathtaking drama in "Selma"; there's an urgent realism in the storytelling, as if we're seeing this just in time. And indeed we are ...__"Selma" demands to be seen now and by the generations that follow.__Selma is an important history lesson that never feels like a lecture. Once school is back in session, every junior high school class in America should take a field trip to see this movie.__This is lucid in its political analysis and sobering in its depictions of racially motivated violence, though it sometimes comes off as stolid.__If not quite in quality then certainly in import and impact, this is the film of the year - of 1965 and perhaps of 2014.__This is no soup-to-nuts King biopic.
Too much of the joy imparted by Muppets Most Wanted has too little to do with the Muppets themselves.__[It] isn't as giddily entertaining as its predecessor but much of the charm remains, making this an ideal destination for a family excursion.__Kids will enjoy it, and there are more than enough clever gags to keep parents amused. But the film lacks the tenderness and rich nostalgia that made The Muppets such an improbable delight.__The songs are infectious, but the rest (despite turns by Tina Fey and Ty Burrell) lacks some of the gang's usual feel-good joy.__The new Muppet movie is as sweet as a bowl of tapioca. And about as interesting.__The movie overflows with funny moments, and Constantine is a terrific character.__The only thing better than one Kermit is two. And the only thing better than two Kermits is one with a Russian accent.__The way that "Muppets Most Wanted" grabs for the green is criminal.__Sunny and cheerful, Muppets Most Wanted is a cascade of epic silliness, good for a few fleeting and familiar chuckles.__A middling letdown.__You don't go to a Muppet movie looking for anything other than a few laughs with beloved puppet pals. Mission accomplished - ka-ching! - on that front.__While it may not be sensational, it's still an inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational Muppet show.__A breezy, mirthful caper enlivened by the comic talents of Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell and Tina Fey.__It all adds up to an eventful entry in the Muppet film library but not a classic one.__The pacing is spot-on, and Fey's Russian guard and Ty Burrell's Interpol agent are wonderful human additions to this comedic romp.__The well-worn plot basics are dressed up nicely by the film's consistently clever humor, as well as a celebrity cameo roster that's stacked even by Muppet standards.__Well played, Muppets 2.0. Well played.__The verbal wit is fairly weak this time around, though as in the previous film there's an endless succession of three-second star cameos.__The film's slightly overplotted feel is offset by the zippiest musical numbers since the Muppets' deservedly beloved 1979 film.__It just feels like something the original Muppet creators might have done.
"Ouija" is hampered by the fact that watching a bunch of people sitting around a table is not inherently cinematic.__"Ouija" has something wrong with it from the first five minutes.__What's left for the dead to say? Not much, it turns out.__Ouija isn't going to redefine the horror genre, but sometimes, it's just nice to have a movie that knows what it's doing and does it well.__Best left on the shelf.__A blah imitation of PG-13 haunted house movies like "Paranormal Activity" and "Insidious."__It is harmless, frighty fun for teenage audiences, but adults will leave theatres with their bejeebers intact.__Scares are more of the Saturday morning cartoon variety, cliched or telegraphed well in advance.__The closing credits announce that "Ouija" is "based on the Hasbro game," but unlike a movie ticket, a board game can easily be returned.__It's professionally produced but completely uninspired.__A deadly dull and overly familiar movie about summoning ghosts that draws upon nearly every horror movie cliche.__Director Stiles White never met an unmotivated jump-scare he didn't like.__Bland, safe horror for those those who like their scares non-existent.__Depending on how jaded you are, a lot of these old tricks still work.__Given its double burden of being both a toy adaptation and a bloodless kiddie horror show, Ouija winds up being more fun than you might think, even if it's the sort of film you can't really take seriously for a second.__Less scary than landing in jail while playing Monopoly.__Fairly routine stuff.__None__None__None
The Boxtrolls represents the best animated movie to reach theater screens since The Lego Movie exploded on the scene in February.__There are many more delighted 'Ewwws' than too-easy 'Awws' in this charming, if a tad cynical, feature from the creators of Coraline and ParaNorman.__It's a world that runs in a parallel universe akin to that of Charles Dickens, with creatively named characters involved in seemingly outlandish adventures in a Victorian-era city where a moral or two plays out in the end.__It's a felt, funny, bracingly sincere kids' movie. And even more refreshing, it takes as a theme our social fixation with waste, salvage and repackaging.__It's a wonderful world, full of Rube Goldberg contraptions below and colorful Dickensian squalor and excess above.__There's little conventional about this movie at all. Thank heavens.__In "The Boxtrolls," old-fashioned stop-motion animation is combined with new-style 3-D cinematography to charming effect.__The details are impressive: 190 puppets built, 79 sets constructed, 20,000 handmade props, 200 costumes, 26 locations, 56 cameras, 892 lights, 53,000 face parts.... But somehow it still doesn't add up to enough.__Imaginative but very weird, more Monty Python than Walt Disney. Not for all tastes.__[A] totally offbeat and original tale for kids (and adults) looking for something a little more challenging and completely off the wall.__Like one of its wondrously designed steampunky contraptions, "The Boxtrolls" is a marvelous thing to behold, and watch spin, even if it doesn't go anywhere terribly interesting.__What makes Boxtrolls truly special is how it challenges kids to consider that the true villain may be the person calling others villains.__The story of "The Boxtrolls," in lesser hands, might have turned out only so-so. Under Laika's loving, labor-intensive touch, it takes on a kind of magic.__Do not think outside "The Boxtrolls." Instead, give yourself over to the movie's captivating, inventive, scary-hilarious world.__Why did the story of this huggable species' attempted extinction leave me emotionally indifferent?__"The Boxtrolls" remains relentlessly busy up through its final credits, and it's clever in a nattering way. But it's virtually charmless.__One gets the sense that directors Anthony Stacchi and Graham Annable have their hearts in the action sequences and not in the characters, and that's a problem.__[An] exquisitely crafted but tedious film.__There are some laughs and the dark, steam-punk look of Cheesebridge is intriguing, but there's little charm.__A delectable treat that balances themes of identity and class warfare with Monty Python-style political skewering, quirky humor and dairy jokes.
"Shadow Recruit" is fun in a minor, winter-season way.__I'm aware that commercial and cultural forces require everything to be rebooted triennially with fresher, hotter stars. But this is the second time the Jack Ryan franchise has rejected a youth transplant.__The dim star wattage in this fifth rehash is palpable from the start.__This is the very definition of an OK thriller.__Director Kenneth Branagh knows how to invest the ridiculous with a sort of grandeur - Exhibit A: the surprisingly fun Thor - but Shadow Recruit is more straightforward in nature, so he can't get too fancy.__Branagh runs through all of this efficiently enough, but it feels awfully familiar.__Almost 25 years later, Jack: Ryan Shadow Recruit tries its best to reignite the Cold War, with tepid results.__Too much of the action in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit takes place on laptops, thumb drives, and video monitors.__"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" comes off as a reasonable facsimile, serviceable but not compelling, something that could pass for the real thing if you're not looking too hard.__The core essentials that made the previous Jack Ryan movies accessible and enjoyable remain intact in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, even if many of the individual pieces have changed.__The dialogue is quick and sharp and there are flourishes to make a spy movie lover smile: sleight-of-hand work and the exchange of a brown envelope in a movie theatre showing 1948 black-and-white classic Sorry, Wrong Number.__Branagh brings no style to Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, and no heart.__Branagh, who proved his action bona fides with "Thor," does an inarguably competent job of choreographing a modestly intelligent espionage thriller, even if it's impossible to identify anything new he's bringing to an already groaning table.__This is moviemaking in a modular mode, an inspiration-free action adventure-with cheesy cinematography-that fills its modest running time by fitting together familiar elements into something reliably, even insistently, not new.__An awkward amalgam of tropes from two different sub-genres, with terrorist sleeper cells and gangster oligarchs operating side by side.__"Jack Ryan" is slick, loud, assured, overplotted (way overplotted), fairly diverting, and pretty much empty.__Under taut direction from Kenneth Branagh (who also plays the Russian heavy), Pine is convincing as a character who is pushing papers one day, and dodging assassins in Moscow the next.__Pine brings a welcome boyishness and idealism to Ryan, but he's clobbered with cliches by his director and screenwriters. The evildoers, it turns out, were right in his own backyard.__As espionage thrillers go, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit skillfully marshals all the familiar elements. That's the damn problem.__The cast brings welcome personality to a competent, energetic reboot before the uninspired action scenes pile up in a standard time-bomb climax.
The title refers to Mia's fraught decision-should she cling to existence or just give up?-and, well before the end, even loyal viewers will be begging her to hurry up and choose.__Documentarian R.J. Cutler, in his feature debut, joins Moretz in delivering this pap as if it meant something. Cue eye rolling.__For a drama pretty much aimed at 12-year-old girls, this is less superficial than you'd expect.__The heroine lies in the coma, but the audience may feel brain-dead by the end of If I Stay.__You want these people to have real challenges and messiness. But their lives don't quite feel lived in; they feel exemplary.__[Moretz's] grounded, naturalistic presence goes a long way toward making mushy material palatable.__If I Stay is true to principle in one significant regard: It makes no concessions to anyone outside its teenage female cohort.__Moretz has a nicely calibrated energy and intensity, and the teen romance ups-and-downs of Mia and Adam's relationship - are they really soul mates, or will he drop her when the right groupie shambles along? - feel authentically OMG-ish.__Plays like a high school version of 'Ghost.'__"If I Stay" shuttles between lachrymose developments at the hospital and a series of flashbacks that detail the Mia-Adam relationship. Not surprisingly, the romance is where you want to be.__What works for readers, left free to produce their own versions of fantasy devices, can be gigglesome for audiences confronted with a film's prefab literalism.__A cleanly directed, credibly acted machine for the production of tears.__This overlong adaptation of Gayle Forman's popular young adult novel manages to make the usually effervescent Moretz seem dull.__Maybe on the page this all seems less ridiculous.__If you're not in tears by this movie's end, it probably wasn't intended for you anyway.__It's a tough balancing act melding dewy-eyed teen romance with family tragedy, and harder still to weave in rousing rock performances and gorgeous classical music. If I Stay ambitiously tries to fuse it all and occasionally succeeds.__"If I Stay" just barely makes the B honor roll, despite a fine job by dark-indie darling Chloe Grace Moretz in her mainstream breakout performance.__The settings and supporting roles suggest that "If I Stay" started out as someone's passion project, but the final product only requires its star to sleepwalk through buckets of schlock.__Almost everything in the film feels either forced or false, so the tears aren't earned.__There are even shades of Bergman in the existential premise, but director J.R. Cutler is more interested in the young leads' cookie-cutter romance, and the clunky nonlinear plot precludes any sort of comprehensive narrative.
Not dissimilar in merrily ghoulish spirit to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', it's hugely entertaining.__Such a crowded, colorful, more-is-not-nearly-enough aesthetic could easily have felt garish and confusing. But for some reason, it doesn't.__Without a doubt, it is one of 2014's best animated films; a holiday delight that exuberantly bursts at the seams with irresistible cultural pride.__Whether en ingles o en espanol, The Book of Life is a delight. In an animated universe cluttered with kung-fu pandas, ice princesses and video-game heroes, Gutierrez and del Toro have conjured up an original vision.__The Book of Life moves breezily from one scene to the next, keeping the pace brisk and rarely skipping a beat.__A joyful, energetic but unconventional 3-D animated adventure with a distinct Latino flavour.__"The Book of Life" juxtaposes overwrought visual imagery with an undernourished, familiar story - regrettable flaws in one of the few animated films to focus on Latino characters and the rich heritage of Mexican folk culture.__This often beautiful and too-often moribund, if exhaustingly frenetic, feature tends to be less energetic than the dead people waltzing through it.__It isn't easy to stand out in a crowded animation field, but Dallas' Reel FX has done it with The Book of Life, one of the best animated films so far this year.__Other aspects of the story might be conventional, but the atmospheric visuals aren't.__The Book of Life's meticulous, eye-popping visuals alone would be reason enough to upgrade to a 3-D seat. But once you hear the inspired renditions of Radiohead's Creep and Biz Markie's Just a Friend...you will be hooked on this tongue-in-cheek tale.__Funny without being frantic, seamlessly switching from dry humor to slapstick, it shows death as a part of life -- and, judging from a preview audience of very young tykes, does so in a gentle, delightful way.__Like Mexico's Day of the Dead, the movie enjoyably, and successfully, mixes the macabre with the celebratory.__A visually stunning, funny movie that trusts children to deal with subject matter that many films don't: specifically, death.__"The Book of Life" may use state-of-the-art animation, but it derives its strength from the wisdom of antiquity. It only looks new, but it's as old as life (and death) itself.__The vibrant animated feature "The Book of Life" is a cheeky celebration of Mexican folklore with a solid cast, an irreverent sensibility and gorgeous visuals.__This Pixar knockoff from 20th Century Fox is more imaginative than most, though like far too many of them, it's undone by a surfeit of glib one-liners and pop culture references.__"The Book of Life" is a flawed but intriguing new chapter in animation.__The characters move around in a thoroughly realized universe full of imaginative and beautifully rendered detail.__Almost (but not quite) makes up in visuals what it lacks in snappy dialogue.
On paper, About Last Night is a third-generation copy of David Mamet's 1974 stage play Sexual Perversity in Chicago -- but if anything... it comes closer to Mamet's rancorous vision of dueling hormones than the '80s screen version did.__While this version lacks the subtlety of the original, it delivers enough raunchy humor to be far more entertaining.__The 2014 model of About Last Night... it beefs up the girl-side element of the story, incorporates considerably more frank sex talk, and generally provides its cast with a lot more meat to chew on and spit back out.__Mostly, Hart aces his many showcase moments, not so much stealing the movie as occasionally letting the other actors possess it for a while.__Neither director Steve Pink nor screenwriter Leslye Headland put much effort into basic storytelling.__his film has the looseness of a movie made of outtakes -- but they mostly work, and they mostly involve Hall and Hart. They're the undercard that takes over the movie.__"About Last Night" makes for a pretty terrific date movie... because it demands only a commitment to be entertained, but still manages to make you consider what it means to be in a relationship.__Of all the date movies available for Valentine's weekend, About Last Night has the edge. That edge is mostly Kevin Hart.__The resulting film won't help you understand men or women any better, but it will make you laugh. And we all know that's the quickest way to the heart.__It's a fresh update on an old story made relevant by a strong cast.__It's a good set-up and contrast, and Pink keeps things moving, while finding times for a few in-jokes and some nice tunes on the soundtrack.__About Last Night is frisky fun made all the more entertaining because of the potent chemistry between its quartet of lead actors.__Has little new to offer about romantic entanglements that audiences haven't seen countless times in movies and, especially, on TV sitcoms since 1986, not to mention before that.__About Last Night takes us through the Honeymoon Phase and into the difficult realm beyond. That's where couples have to work to stay together, and that's where this movie gains its strongest traction.__It's a romantic dramedy timed for release on Valentine's Day, a confection equal parts tart and sweet.__A sweet, silly, semi-raunchy Valentine's Day confection directed by Steve Pink.__What's missing are the jolts of realism and flashes of insight that made the original so stealthily effective.__Though it's based on a David Mamet play now 40 years old, "About Last Night" feels as fresh and vital as any romantic comedy hot off the script pile.__You could take your honey for Valentine's Day. But, really, a dozen fake roses and a card from CVS would be more personal.__The four leads are entirely engaging including the manic Hart, who seems to play variations of the same character in every movie.
What we've got here is somewhere between Twister and one of those storm-chaser reality shows, except Jan de Bont made Twister.__When the badass cyclones muscle into town, ripping up schools, banks and airports, the film is fairly fun. Sadly, everything else about it is, well, a bit of a disaster.__The destruction and carnage is presented with verve and flair, making this a fine example of tornado porn.__A visually stunning disaster-thriller that ultimately feels cheap with its perverse take on death and gratitude.__If weak plotting isn't a big concern, then Into the Storm may be right up your tornado alley.__Have we ever before seen such big-ticket escapist entertainment about the awesomeness of something that so recently killed so many of us? Doesn't it usually take longer before everyone's eager for candy spun from trauma?__Don't get me wrong, I'm as willing to check my brain at the door and sumbit to an idiotic late-summer spectacle as the next person. But this funnel-cloud fiasco tries to suck up everything in its path, and just winds up sucking.__A more sophisticated version of "Sharknado."__It's all very, very silly - not to mention off-puttingly earnest.__"Into the Storm" features laughable dialogue, far-fetched situations, and generic characters played by actors who almost look like more famous stars. I still had a blast; and if you lower your resistance, you may too.__As disaster movies go, "Into the Storm" is fairly disastrous itself.__Into the Storm has some seriously impressive, wicked special effects. Its rapid pace and thundering sound effects quite effectively ram you, wide-eyed, jaw agape, against your seat back. It has nothing else.__It's no spoiler to reveal that these tornadoes just happen to be the biggest storms that ever were, and watching them chew up buildings like they were so many corn bread muffins can't help but be involving.__This must be the only disaster movie in which presumably intelligent characters decide to hide from a storm in a storm drain.__The notion that we should worry about human beings - even poor Matt Walsh, heroically staying deadpan as lead storm chaser - becomes a source of humor in what is otherwise a showcase for extreme weather.__"Sharknado" without the jokes.__What's remarkable about this long-belated and low-rent knockoff ... is the velocity of its cheerful idiocy, the blithe vacuity of its narrative downtime between tornado touchdowns.__"Into the Storm" consists mainly of watching characters run from various little tornadoes before they have to take cover from a very large one.__The special effects are skillfully wrought, scary and exciting. But when the story focuses on those weathering the onslaught, things are far less thrilling.__The found-footage disaster flick "Into the Storm'' is "Twister'' for dummies, but by no means is that an insult. The new film is enormous fun if you're in the right mood.
There are a number of fine reasons to see the courtroom-meets-family melodrama The Judge. As you might suspect, two stand out: actors Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr.__A charismatic performance from Downey Jr and the growling presence of Duvall make up for a multitude of sins in this big and brash family drama .__I don't expect The Judge to usher in a new era of legal thrillers, but I'm happy to see Downey leave the Marvel universe and Baker Street behind.__It wants to be many movies, and fails at being even one of them.__This is not by any means a bad movie. The script has its bright patches, the setting is picturesque, and the cast is full of actors you'll want to see.__An overstuffed, overlong slog of a legal drama. Director David Dobkin coats every cliche with cheap theatrics. Go ahead, see The Judge just for Downey and Duvall. But to cite another recent dud, this is where I leave you.__A blue-chip cast struggles with an unwieldy script in The Judge, a hybrid comedy, family-reconciliation story and legal drama.__Let's just say any film that has a high school romance rekindled, hints of incest, cancer, professional baseball, mental disability and repeated vomiting has too much going on, especially when some things have no tie to the basic story.__The Judge is a tale of family dysfunction, the sins of the father and all that.__Duvall and Downey create a memorable mutual antipathy with echoes that go back as far as Raymond Massey squaring off against James Dean in "East of Eden."__An overlong crowd-pleaser that mistakes a hackneyed catharsis for something more meaningful.__A sprawl of narrative that is as unconvincing as the suspiciously sprawl-free, nostalgia-tinged town where it all takes place.__It's "what people want." Whereas I say the hell with people and what they want.__[Duvall and Downey] may not be enough to counterbalance the bloat of the rest of the film, but they keep it from sinking under the weight of soggy sentimentality.__There were reports that Duvall initially turned down this script, only to reconsider because he wanted to work with Downey. Good call.__Always the most inscrutable of the great '70s actors, Duvall uses his great, unassuming American face to convey pride, confusion, pain and compassion - sometimes all at once.__More than two hours of sharp dialogue and great acting, if not particularly inventive plotting.__While it's good to know that character-driven dramas still have a place at the movies, "The Judge" might have worked better as a television miniseries.__Dobson ... may be a bit clumsy out of the gate with more sensitive material, but wisely gives his seasoned cast a lot of rope.__Despite playing with a stacked deck, "The Judge" is guilty of exceeding expectations.
A scattered, haphazard, thoroughly confused film that can't figure out if it's meant to be a winningly cutesy musical or a gritty narrative about life in crime-ridden 1950s New Jersey.__Christopher Walken plays a gangster who can fix anything; maybe he should have taken charge of the film.__Jersey Boys comes to life only toward the end.__It's glossy and entertaining but also safe and conventional. If my father had lived to age 72, he would have loved this movie. This is your target audience.__At times the movie version of "Jersey Boys" captures the electric excitement of the musical, but for every soaring moment, there are 10 minutes of bickering or brooding.__Curiously moribund ...__[The movie] hauls out just about every showbiz cliche in the catalog.__"Eastwood's got a feel for music (he composed the scores for most of his recent films). But he doesn't have a particular flair for musical staging."__The film is a funny mix of formulaic and fresh. The numbers are too polished - there's no sense of discovery. But the songs and their harmonies are evergreen.__Aptly if somewhat awkwardly, Jersey Boys finds its most soulful moment in a movie version of a curtain call. Only it's pretty complicated when a movie's most rousing moment comes as the closing credits roll.__Valli and the Four Seasons' story might well have been true, but as drama, it's thin and occasionally dull.__What makes Jersey Boys work is its Rashomon device of letting each member of the group tell part of the story from his point of view. And it's all woven together by those familiar, catchy songs.__As deliberately, consciously old-fashioned as it sometimes is, Clint Eastwood's "Jersey Boys" is also often fresh, with a self-aware sense of fun ...__Trust me, you've watched condominium lobby channels that are more exciting than this.__"Jersey Boys" hits the high notes with ease, and offers the low ones for contemplation.__Eastwood, directing his 33d film, adds some keen-eyed realism to the showbiz schmaltz.__The film's wooziness wouldn't be disastrous if it swept audiences up in the zest of pop creation.__Can simultaneously be enjoyed as a fun summer musical set in a bygone era and a Gatsby-style American tragedy about the impossibility of escaping the past.__What saves it are those nostalgic, soaring doo-wop numbers ... and Eastwood's measured doses of directorial playfulness, such as when the actors cheekily break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience, as they did on Broadway.__Engagingly lively, if not always graceful, and often surprisingly comic.
What's missing from Blended? Two key ingredients: it doesn't touch the heart and it doesn't tickle the funny bone (at least not often enough).__The romance is sweet and even effervescent, the comedy is homespun and sentimental, but it's packaged with such a repellent batch of stereotypes and prejudices that it's unpalatable even to contemplate.__In the world of this sitcom love story, men are from Mars and women should be from a defiled menstrual tent far enough away that Adam Sandler won't have to hear them talk about tampons.__Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star in Blended, their third pairing, and, while the chemistry may be good, the movie isn't.__Comedians often draw on childhood influences, and Adam Sandler and his team do it in the worst possible way in Blended.. [which] is like a Bizarro version of The Brady Bunch.__Sandler would piss out of the screen if he thought he could get a laugh. This is not his worst film, but it's his most offensive.__Another year has passed, and so, as with the cold inevitability of death, another Adam Sandler movie is upon us.__A decent movie might actually be buried here somewhere deep, deep down. The world will never know.__I think I smiled, twice.__The laughs are sporadic and the supposedly tender moments are as heartwarming as a Hot Pocket.__Blended throws a lot of things on the screen, but in the end, it has to confront its awkward and artificial "romance." And that's just ugly.__Blended is a rather sloppily-made effort, with stock shots of lions and giraffes randomly dropped in.__Will Adam Sandler ever grow up?__Most of "Blended" has the look and pacing of a three-camera sitcom filmed by a bunch of eighth graders and conceived by their less bright classmates.__A fun, often funny, largely enjoyable romp. The trick: Manage your expectations.__The sunnier that Barrymore gets in her scenes with Sandler, the more the iffy elements and leaden bits seem to just melt away. Blend in more of that spirit, and their latest pairing might rate better.__Each sweet moment is inevitably punctuated by some in-your-face joke that's at least as stupid as the preceding moments were heartfelt.__The pair have obvious chemistry. That doesn't mitigate the stupidity and predictability of the plot, but at least it's not painful to sit through.__The familiar Sandler-Barrymore chemistry lends a bit of sparkle to this otherwise predictable family rom-com.__A rehash of Adam Sandler's 2011 comedy "Just Go With It," only without Jennifer Aniston and without laughs.
This might be an anti-pharmaceutical, anti-cult, anti-plot, anti-suspense allegory. It could also just be Thanksgiving at your robot-zombie in-laws.__For much of the movie, viewers will be asking themselves where the conflict is. And, by extension, the drama.__The Giver is more simple and raw than the rest of today's teen dystopias that try to cram in unnecessary backstory and love triangles.__As Jonas, Brenton Thwaites brings thoughtful wonder to the role of a young man who is thrilled and frightened by what he learns.__The magic gets lost in translation.__In the ranks of dystopian YA-targeted motion pictures, this one can stand alongside its peers.__The movie never really sheds its chilly Orwellian vibe, and its chief idea -- that only The Giver and Jonas can truly feel -- is contradicted by the supposedly blanked-out citizens who, in fact, appear to have feelings indeed, albeit nasty ones.__Lois Lowry took chances with her novel. The movie of The Giver takes none. It's safe, sorry and a crashing bore.__A movie that plays like a low-rent Logan's Run crossed with a UNICEF commercial.__Another week, another movie about a special adolescent who saves society from the forces of darkness.__Noyce, working from an adaptation by screenwriters Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide, finds a compelling through-line ...__"The Giver" offers more than just the standard clamorous post-apocalyptic claptrap that fuels far too many films these days.__The enervating hash of dystopian dread, vague religiosity and commercial advertising-style uplift is nothing if not stale.__Not even Streep and Bridges can lift The Giver beyond the level of a post-apocalyptic after-school special.__The truth is that it's dim, perfunctory and wide-eyed, at least in every moment when Bridges isn't on the screen.__"The Giver" was ahead of its time as a book. But as a movie, it's too late.__It's the latest in the long line of movies made from novels set in a dystopian future where a young person has heroism thrust upon their slim shoulders...Yet, taken on its own, it's a well-made and effectively told morality tale.__Once you've gotten the lesson at the heart of the film, the rest of The Giver seems almost redundant. It's rather a problem.__In the end, the film practically collapses under its own...hmm, what's the opposite of 'weight'?__If the movie hits ominous notes, they've all been heard many times before ...
Sentimental slop.__St. Vincent will dodge your impulse to projectile vomit. For that, all hail Bill Murray who whacks away at the script's sentimental softballs like A-Rod in full swing.__The adult supporting players are all excellent, but next to Murray, the key casting is Jaeden Lieberher as young Oliver. The kid is a natural in the sidekick role, never once playing it too cute or too actor-y.__It's good to see funny gal McCarthy playing the straight woman in this comedy rather than the appealing/appalling lout. It's even better to see a working mom depicted with care.__St. Vincent is no conventional hagiography but it's the movie world's equivalent - a star vehicle. Give director Melfi credit for knowing the capacity of the engine he has under its hood.__One of these days, someone should make a movie about a really nasty old guy who, by the end of the story, is still a nasty old guy.__"St. Vincent" may not be a great movie, but it is a great lot of fun to watch.__Murray, with a stable of eccentric characters ranging across the landscape of his career, has selected increasingly idiosyncratic roles in recent years. Vincent is no exception.__Murray, of course, makes it all work well enough.__Bill Murray is one of those actors blessed with the gift of making bad behavior seem grizzled and adorable. It's a valuable tool in any funny person's kit, and Murray uses it to carry the benignly naughty St. Vincent above its material.__What is Murray doing in this sort of tapioca?__It's a familiar premise - we've seen similar stuff in "Little Miss Sunshine" and "Up" - but it sails ahead on the collective charms of its ensemble cast.__A movie with laughter, soul and a twisting path to the heart.__You just wonder how much more fun it could have been.__[Murray's] freewheeling, deadpan image fuses so thoroughly with Vincent's own endearingly grizzled misanthropy that it's hard to tell where the actor ends and the geezer begins.__Of course, Murray is the star attraction here, in a role that's both fan-friendly and reminiscent of the range he showed in "Broken Flowers" and "Lost in Translation."__The broader visual comedy lacks finesse. But the actors win out.__If St. Vincent flirts with sappiness - it does, and how - Melfi has struck gold in the pairing of Murray and Lieberher.__The movie slumps into the hokey, and the actor's curdled misanthropy makes way for a soothing, implausible uplift.__So thoroughly artificial that the Coke Zero you bought in the lobby will look like a shot of wheatgrass juice by comparison.
This is cinema reduced or distilled to its purest definition, of movies that move__This movie is a complete bore.__There's nothing here you haven't seen before.__You wouldn't think a movie called Need For Speed would feel so slow.__It's like watching someone ELSE play a video game for more than two hours. That gets old real fast.__Though later sequences lean a little too heavily on contemporary car flick cliches ... they are all nonetheless informed by a gee-whiz appreciation for gleaming cars and stunt driving ingenuity.__Need For Speed fails spectacularly on so many levels, it almost begs you to bring back the hyperactive, overacting Nicolas Cage for Drive Angry 2. Almost.__Honestly, Aaron Paul, what were you thinking?__You'd have to be a true carmudgeon (sorry) to want it to stop.__This is a film you want to see for the racing, and in that sense it doesn't disappoint.__In trying for the vicarious varoom of the street-racing video game that inspired it, and no doubt dreaming of "Fast" success, "Speed" clocks in at a long two-plus hours and falls painfully short.__Rather than fine-tune the narrative engine, the filmmakers hit the gas with not much more in the tank than sumptuously photographed car porn, robbing what could have been a high-toned B-movie of any punch.__"Need for Speed" is dumb and loud and sometimes technically impressive, which means that it is successful on its own terms.__With dozens of crashes, injuries and possible deaths caused by the street racers in Need for Speed, what stands out most is the story's callous disregard for human life.__If you know your muscle cars and supercars and don't care too much about other people, the movie will be your bottle of Yahoo, so pardon the rest of us if we look on these self-absorbed camshaft brats and wish them a speedy flat tire.__What to say about a racing movie that's stuck in idle as drama? For starters, don't race to see it... there's nothing to distract you from a plot so tired there are tire tracks from other racing movies all over it.__Not to be a killjoy, but if filmmakers are going to embed pixel mayhem in the photo-real world, then they're inviting us to ask if this shit is sociopathic.__You can see why the film stretches out to 130 minutes. It contains 45 minutes of setup, then a cross-country race before the climactic -- make that anticlimactic -- race.__Happily, director Scott Waugh comes out of the stunt world himself, and there's a refreshing emphasis on actual, theoretically dangerous stunt driving over digital absurdities.__"Need For Speed" rides roughshod over morality.
The one person who gets the balance right, weighing parody and homage, is the composer, Joel McNeely, whose opening theme stirs hopes and memories that the movie cannot match.__A Million Ways to Die in the West feels like about 80 minutes of material was padded out to 110 minutes.__The movie, which MacFarlane directed and cowrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, is clever about its anachronisms. You stay surprised.__In A Million Ways to Die in the West, director-star Seth MacFarlane builds an imposing, affectionate reconstruction of the American movie West, then defaces it with funny mustaches -- often literally.__If you measure a comedy by how many times you laughed, Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West, at least for me, is a middling success.__Despite all the costumes, stunt work, and locations in Monument Valley, this big-budget western spoof by Seth MacFarlane is too glib to live up to its potential.__But for all its hit-and-miss jokes, there are lots of ways to die laughing at this Western raunchfest.__Some of the gags do land - maybe one in four. But the genre-parody genre with big stars and poop jokes needs a little more class than MacFarlane is capable of providing.__Yes, there are a million ways to die in the west. Boredom shouldn't be one of them.__This movie feels like it has a million jokes, and every single one arrives with a lethal thud.__Feels more like an extended riff than a fully fleshed-out film.__If there were a shootout in the Hollywood comedic corral between...Blazing Saddles, and the new kid in town, A Million Ways to Die in the West, it's not even a contest. Brooks' classic would chase the upstart out of town with a backside full of lead.__One long joke about much it would have sucked to live (and die, at a relatively young age), in the Old West.__The down-for-anything cast, along with a handful of welcome cameos, can't prop up its weakest link: Seth MacFarlane.__MacFarlane is a very funny dude, and there are times "A Million Ways to Die" is indeed funny. But too often the movie feels half-baked.__Your mileage may vary depending on your enthusiasm for his smirking frat-boy comedy.__There's nothing about this plotline that doesn't feel like a retread, and MacFarlane, I'm sorry to report, still seems like the funniest guy in the writers' room rather than a genuine movie star.__What's to hate? Let me count the ways. The laziness of the writing. The numbing overreliance on poop and pee jokes. The long, arid stretches between anything resembling a joke.__The problem isn't that the jokes are crass; they're just not that funny.__Much of the film rests on MacFarlane's shoulders, and he has toned down the snide, obnoxious demeanor that spoiled his turn as the 2013 Oscars host.
It's not perfect. But it is special, especially for a mid-budget Hollywood action drama, and it has stuck firmly in my mind since that late-night screening last Friday.__Stahelski and Leitch, both former stunt men, unsurprisingly tackle action sequences with glee... but the quieter scenes are more sophisticated, incorporating a sense of fantasy and visual splendor that almost makes the wafer-thin plot feel fresh.__Yet, for all the film's stylishness and a body count worthy of a small civil war, there's no getting around the fact that stiff, stoic Reeves -- who is capable of a few funny, deadpan lines -- isn't a particularly compelling lead action figure.__Stylishly violent and not much else.__Action movies are about movement, and John Wick pursues that goal with remorseless verve.__John Wick feels like action manna for its cleanly designed gun-fu sequences... but the revenge plotting is deeply dopey and we shouldn't have to choose one or the other.__John Wick is a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days.__John Wick is the kind of fired-up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of.__This is not an action movie in the Michael Bay lineage; rather than an escalating series of explosions, John Wick offers a slow burn, sizzling in a manner true to its hero's surname.__Mostly it's Keanu playing bang-bang. If that sounds great, go see the movie. If not, congratulations on aspiring to better things.__While the body count grows numbing and repetitive, "John Wick" actually is more compelling in the aesthetically heightened, specifically detailed world it depicts.__It's a beautiful coffee-table action movie.__It's a B movie made with A-student love for the relentless thrill of bodies in brutal motion.__This is a film where every human being is a sack of meat waiting to be tenderized.__This movie is so over the top, you can't track it on radar.__It gets old fast.__Director Chad Stahelski handles the frenzied fusillade with flair. The action scenes in John Wick, while brutal, are also rather breathtaking.__It's all sharp stuff from Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad, and Reeves finds decently tailored material in their mix of busy physicality, spare drama, and wickedly dry humor.__Stahelski has created an impressively distinctive, self-contained world for John Wick that emphasizes sophistication and stylishness.__Harboring few ambitions beyond knock-your-socks-off action sequences, this crafty revenge thriller delivers with so much style - and even some wit - that the lack of substance takes longer than it should to become problematic.
Birdman, more than most, seems a film that deserves a second viewing, not only to admire the work of Keaton and his co-stars, but to delve into its many layers.__It's a quasi-religious fable about a man haunted by the past and facing a profound moral and existential crisis in the present, and it's a dazzling display of virtuoso cinematic technique and showboat performances.__This is a strange and beautiful and unique film, one of the best movies of the year.__Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is the sort of movie that ends up on a person's favourite-movies-of-all-time list. It's really that fresh.__Birdman takes advantage of every facet of Keaton's talent, from his knack for absurdist comedy to his seemingly effortless ability to tap into graceful profundity without making a big show of it.__Whether or not Riggan is in fact possessed of divine abilities-Inarritu offers contradictory clues along the way-Birdman puts on clear display the indisputable superpowers of its cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki.__It's a white elephant of a movie that conceals a mouse of timid wisdom, a mighty and churning machine of virtuosity that delivers a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama.__Challenges, surprises and dazzles while still working at the edges of a frazzled mind.__My, but the new Alejandro G. Inarritu movie, Birdman, has some fascinating things going on.__A jaw-dropping stylistic wow that spins, pirouettes, turns inside out, and miraculously stays aloft for two hours.__Does it dip? A time or two. Does it take vivid flight? Absolutely.__Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman is so good, so profoundly entertaining, so confident that it makes you wonder whether the other Inarritu -- the director of such weighty magazine spreads as 21 Grams, Babel, and Biutiful -- was a fraud all along.__I want to like Birdman more, but I don't have to; it's already so pleased with itself.__You want to latch onto Birdman's scruffy neck and fly wherever it goes, even if it's too close to the sun.__Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, director of such ethereal dramas as Babel and 21 Grams, counterbalances the wicked backstage comedy with surreal flights of fancy, pondering the gulf between dubious celebrity and artistic immortality.__Inspires renewed faith in what we used to go to the movies for - original storytelling, enveloping escape, heart-stopping camera work and enough "wait, what's going on here?" to keep us intrigued from beginning to end.__Lots of films claim to be different. "Birdman" is.__"Birdman" vividly evokes a time of equal parts possibility and terrifying uncertainty, and makes a persuasive case that, when the ground is shifting beneath your feet, the best thing to do is to take flight.__One of the best movies of 2014.__"Birdman" proves that a movie - the grabbiest, most kinetic film ever made about putting on a play - can soar on the wings of its own technical prowess, even as the banality of its ideas threatens to drag it back down to earth.
This is innocuous, heart-in-the-right-place family fare, but its well-earned points about animal rights and preservation would be better taken if the relentless sentimentality didn't force viewers into flippers-in-the-air submission.__Some angst away from the dolphin tank feels like padding, but there's enough bona fide narrative to please tomorrow's marine biologists and their parents.__In a world full of cheapened, bombastic entertainment aimed at children, this modest, honest little movie feels special in its own way.__Children will revel in Dolphin Tale 2 with its rapturous, lovingly filmed sequences of dolphins playing, swimming, and generally frolicking about with each other and with their human friends.__This is exceedingly mild entertainment.__It's wholesome, engaging and rife with impressive aquatic photography.__There's some lovely underwater cinematography and a few dollops of suspense. But Dolphin Tale 2 is mostly an easy, breezy ride that will please younger audiences and their parents with its message of resilience and hope.__"Dolphin Tale 2" is both uneventful and predictable, but it deserves credit for treating its nonhuman characters with respect.__Dolphin Tale 2 is a slow-moving anomaly, delivered when most kids' films tumble over one another to see which can deliver the thrills faster and funnier.__Smith has an eye for knockabout farce and for untrammeled beauty, and his camera is always in the right place to capture the ecstatic sight of dolphins in motion.__Gamble and Zuehlsdorff are likable. Neither their looks nor their acting is airbrushed. Like Connick, they know the value of restraint.__Sweet and cheesy.__It's kind of sad to see Rufus the Pelican getting way more screen time and plot significance than characters played by Kris Kristofferson and Ashley Judd.__A coo-inducing movie that runs on autopilot without veering into the realm of bad taste.__It's worth wading through some sugary-sweet human drama, and the occasional wooden line delivery, for that intimate look at nature.__Like its predecessor, Dolphin Tale 2 is a family-friendly story with a heart-warming and wise message of healing.__At least they brought back the pelican.__The original "Dolphin Tale" was so anodyne it felt like a 1950s TV series: episodic problems resolved in an ultrasafe atmosphere, often by parental, generally fatherly, advice. This is more of the same.__Even for a movie about complying with USDA regulations, "Dolphin Tale 2" is a little lacking in excitement.__It remains an appealing fantasy about super-teens saving sick animals.
The movie borrows so liberally from other action films that it starts to feel at times a bit like a BuzzFeed listicle.__At this point, the Expendables have formed and reformed so many times they're like the world's most macho wife swap, the action version of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.__A wasted opportunity.__For a variety of reasons, most having to do with a weak screenplay and poor pacing, The Expendables 3 is the least successful entry in the series.__The series did reignite a few careers and bring forth one decent popcorn movie (The Expendables 2). Rather than artificially extend its life, maybe the time has come to say Rest in Peace.__The Expendables 3, trading on our affection for action stars of the past, has officially worn out its already shaky welcome.__Those first two movies look like Seven Samurai next to The Expendables 3, a sad, bad, parade of uninspired cameos and listless violence.__The film's sporadic set pieces simply aren't captivating enough to forgive all the movie's other faults.__The third installment in Sylvester Stallone's jobs program for expired action heroes is easily the best of the bunch, which is not to say it's any good.__Proof that sometimes even your low expectations can be far too high.__"The Expendables" series deserves a movie as muscular as its stars. For now, "The Expendables 3" isn't it.__This Sylvester Stallone franchise has devolved into the clown car of action movies: a casting gimmick to see how many AARP actors you can cram into one vehicle.__A kind of ho-hum experience, wherein a lot of bullets are expended and a lot of structures exploded to minimal dramatic effect.__It's all a bit like a classic-rock tribute concert, or playing with all your action figures at once, or maybe "Cannonball Run," with the strained buddy-buddy back-and-forth.__Sometimes there really is no substitute for age and experience.__With its third entry, the Sylvester Stallone-led Expendables franchise finally becomes the live-action Saturday morning cartoon it was always destined to be.__Sadly, the most expendable thing about The Expendables 3 is the movie itself.__"The Expendables 3" gets the franchise back on track.__So much star power packed together in one place hasn't produced such a cheesy result since the recording of "We Are the World."__A slightly breezier and dependably brainless installment of Stallone's action franchise.
The mildewed found-footage technique allows some tension to build from offscreen action, but also renders the knockoff John Williams score inexplicable.__You can imagine ET phoning his legal team, but although this kids' sci-fi adventure is derivative, its characters are drawn with more care and insight than you'd expect.__If the movie is a waste, at least it's an instructive one, signaling just how offensive children's entertainment might become in the YouTube era.__Combining some classic plot movements and plenty of modern trappings (just, like, a lot of cell phones), Earth to Echo is a sweet family film that has something for everyone.__Unlike the very successful Spanish horror thriller [Rec] or even the nausea-inducing Cloverfield, which Echo more closely resembles, this film doesn't maintain a consistent point of view or any logic about what's on screen.__With authentic characters, dialogue and settings, Echo's filmmakers have successfully created a story younger kids and pre-teens growing up in a Millennial and post-Millennial culture can relate to.__Spielberg's E.T., so ugly it was cute, was also full of personality. Echo is adorable and forgettable, and the rest of the characters are simply plot holders in a narrative contraption that generates jeopardy-raising obstacles to Echo going home.__Savvily, and perhaps cynically, seeks to be the first to surf what I fear will be the new cinematic language: automatic Google Glass.__The movie's continually reiterated theme of lasting friendship is unlikely to affect even the most impressionable young viewers ...__First, the script is dumb.__A digital remastering of E.T. for the smartphone social-media kinderkultur.__Earth to Echo has just enough teen angst to toughen up its adorability and to temper its predictability. It's a simplistic movie, but there's a darkness to it.__"Earth to Echo" recalls - but doesn't live up to - films like "Super 8" and "Stand By Me," stories of youth, innocence and the Summer That Changed Everything.__At least the title is honest. The whole movie's an echo - of something better and far more original, now bounced back at us, more and more quietly, until it finally fades away.__Sure, Earth to Echo is derivative, but it's refreshingly updated. Echo, I.M. home.__On its own modest terms, the alien adventure "Earth to Echo" is a lively and likable knockoff that should divert, if not exactly enthrall, tweens and young teens.__A chipper, shallow knockoff of classic suburban adventure movies ...__Despite its flaws and recycled parts, "Earth to Echo" is engaging enough to impress pre-teen audiences and nostalgic enough to please their parents.__The movie feels less like a weak "E.T." than a substandard "Mac and Me."__The young cast's interaction is terrific. You might come for the turn-on-your-heartlight riff, but you'll stay for the connection the boys share.
A tired premise and a sheen of desperate flop sweat tanks this DOA comedy, which plays more like an ancient Playboy doodle than a full-fledged movie.__Even for a farce, the situations stretch credulity far beyond the breaking point.__It's strange to watch a comedy full of talented people that does not work from the opening scene. It's like eating food and not tasting anything.__Sex Tape is warmer and more amusing than its ads would lead one to believe. In fact, it's almost good enough, leaning a little too hard on the innate likability of stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel.__At heart, it's about as naughty as an old Disney movie with Dean Jones, Suzanne Pleshette, and an unruly Great Dane. I liked its gung-ho slapstick spirit, though. No one's slacking off.__Sex is treated first as brainless imperative, then as acrobatic duty, then as desperate consequence - it's never sexy in any way.__The folks behind Sex Tape did their homework. They just forgot the laughs.__Yes, there are some laughs, but they're not as big or as frequent as one might expect from a would-be "major" comedy.__An uneasy comedy that is not without its laugh-out-loud moments.__Just lie back and think of funnier films.__Since it's a comedy, much could be forgiven if the film was consistent in generating laughs, but the comedy is as erratic as the couple's sex life.__The real sex tape that [the characters] Jay and Annie are chasing all over town might have at least had some instructive value. The movie Sex Tape that Jason and Cameron have made can't even make that claim.__If the first half of the movie is fairly sharp as these things go, the second half is increasingly, noisily ridiculous, with Diaz working extra hard for her laughs and verging on the shrill.__There's not much to this pratfalling exercise in futility that we haven't seen before except for a flash of Cameron Diaz's bare rump. And that is hardly an experience worth 100 minutes of your one and only life.__Instead of soft core, "Sex Tape" offers no core. No narrative core, just a not-bad notion executed execrably; no core of conviction, just two stars trudging joylessly through swamps of mediocrity.__Given its subject matter and R rating, "Sex Tape" isn't as wild or woolly as it could be.__[A] stilted, nearly humorless, non-titillating slog ...__Sometimes, movies enchant and enlighten us about the human condition, and some nights, you go to "Sex Tape" and hope the popcorn isn't stale.__As timid, bland, and predictable as romantic comedies come ...__The cinematic equivalent of herpes.
It captures an emotional memoir without making it feel like a didactic tale of triumph over adversity.__There's neither cinematic majesty to the vistas (and I saw the movie on a very big screen and sat very close to it) nor intimacy to the ground that Strayed treads.__Witherspoon et al have done justice to Strayed's story.__Wild may sound like a film about redemption, but it's more about learning to live with what you can't control - and accepting what you can control, which is sometimes just as difficult.__What do you do when your heroine is tough but emotionally hurt, bright but glib, grown but immature? Make a film about her that is both painful and uplifting.__Not since June Carter Cash in Walk the Line has Witherspoon been so present to a character. Her Cheryl is funny and messy, wounded but not without survival instincts.__There's nothing particularly wild about "Wild," a forward-plodding story of redemption that follows Reese Witherspoon's determined march toward a best actress Oscar nomination.__A moving (literally and figuratively) experience, a road movie where the road is a trail that sometimes disappears into the trees, or takes a turn onto a jagged precipice.__What the book communicates better than the movie is just how grueling the Pacific Coast Trail can be...But that's only a quibble. Like the book, the movie inspires wanderlust, whether the quest is for your body or your psyche.__The movie gets much of the book and has the added benefit of scenery - lots of it, deserts and mountains and forests spreading out to the far horizons.__Subliminal editing, seamless flashbacks and evocative musical cues make for a captivating trek that dances off the linear path, even as it marches doggedly ahead.__A rare on-the-road movie from a female point of view.__Maybe the lack of answers is the point. How do you save your life by hiking 1,000 miles? By putting one foot in front of the other.__"Wild" for the most part works just fine, and should serve as a terrific career boost for Reese Witherspoon, who's a producer of the film as well as its star.__Unlike its female peers, it's not about rejuvenation at some person's or culture's expense. This land isn't her land. The journey itself gets to you, but so does what it stands for. The only way out of the woods is into them.__Wild attempts to show how getting back to basics can arrest the downward spiral of a life pulled out of orbit by the gravity of pernicious influences.__Vallee has taken a contemplative book where, frankly, very little happens and transformed it into a gut-punching drama.__If Wild is an interesting trek, for both its star and its viewers, it's hardly a feral one.__It's a movie in which you can feel the spirit of the material infusing the filmmaker both as an artist and as a human being, and what results is that thing that occurs when even the simplest of songs sends sparks to the soul.__Everybody has to come a distance to understand Strayed, not least of which is the lady herself, who discovers the simple truth of her marathon march: "How wild it was to let it be."
Sappy, saccharine, and predictable to the point where it's almost painful.__A completely by-the-numbers affair.__JB is not the wisest of men and Million Dollar Arm makes no bones about him being a character in need of an upward arc. Even so, the movie never sacrifices the other characters as mere handmaidens to his growth.__Million Dollar Arm, based on true events, did a fairly good job of keeping me engaged even though I knew exactly where it was going every step of the way.__Million Dollar Arm is cute, cloying, simplistic, borderline offensive ... and thoroughly effective.__Hamm and Bell are likeable actors with terrific timing. The location shots in Mumbai are beautiful, chaotic and jarring. The script is amusing.__Million Dollar Arm pulls so hard on your heartstrings, it tears most of the tendons in its pitching arm.__Hamm doesn't embarrass himself as Bernstein, but the role is hollow -- a savvy guy who needs to learn how nice and lovable he can be.__You can see the stuff "Million Dollar Arm" throws at you from miles away, but that doesn't stop this baseball movie from being genially enjoyable.__[A] watchable but rambling, flaccid movie ...__Among other things, lacks a noteworthy performance to ground an otherwise loosely-constructed film.__An unusual story and sharp talents have been put through the Disney family-film machinery and come out flattened into formula. It's an average movie, and that isn't bad - just average.__"Million Dollar Arm" presents a particularly flagrant case of a true story reprocessed into a feel-good fable that rings false.__It obeys every convention of the genre. But it does so with understatement, style and an exceptional group of actors who bring just the right balance of humor and restraint to their roles.__"Million Dollar Arm" is a baseball movie that pulls off a smooth triple play.__Gets partway to home base but fades by trading scrappy for sappy.__Like JB's persona, Million Dollar Arm is flawed, but also slickly presented and likable.__"Million Dollar Arm" is as predictable as a 3-and-0 pitch down the middle, but when it's baseball season, who wants dark clouds?__The movie is warm and sweet and surprisingly short of speeches extolling the magic of baseball while still reminding us why our national pastime always looks so appealing in the movies.__It all feels labored. In fact, very little of the comedy raises even a smile.
Pleasing to watch... but [leaves] little lasting impression.__There's a mischievous quality to Redmayne that seems a good match with the wit Hawking has always managed to convey with a raised eyebrow and a mechanically-voiced quip.__If the film unfolds like a fairytale, at least it's a fairytale that doesn't often get told.__There's little acrimony in The Theory of Everything, which may reflect Hawking's actual outlook or just the movie's puppyish desire to please.__Director Marsh is a gifted documentarian, but at this point, his dramatic technique is too shallow to get inside his characters' heads.__The film both adheres to and gently upends the conventions of the Great Man genre.__What shines through loud and clear, though, is the humanity in Hawking's incredible story.__A well-made, well-acted but unexceptional film about one of the most exceptional figures of the last half-century.__"The Theory of Everything" offers intimate scenes from a very specific and challenging marriage, warts, black holes and all.__This is rich material for the film's lead actors, and both are superb.__"The Theory of Everything" is a brainy bio that exerts a gravitational pull on the heartstrings.__Redmayne makes you forget you're watching an actor put himself through punishing contortions. He keeps you focused on the soul of a man trapped inside a malfunctioning body.__It also stands as a tear-courting visualization of Hawking's and our precious quandary: time.__Redmayne should be getting a lot of notice for his performance; it's palpable, it's poignant. Jones, too, is terrific.__Hawking himself has seen this film and pronounced it "broadly true," and that diplomatic generalization touches on what's right about it and what's wrong.__It nestles into your consciousness with soft lighting and inspiration.__"The Theory of Everything" is mostly a conventional biopic about two very unconventional people, and it rests comfortably in the hands of the two actors playing Stephen and Jane.__Anchored by a pair of mesmerizing performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, the film almost functions as a more thoughtful companion piece to the blockbuster Interstellar, which also concerns itself with matters of the heart amid the cosmos.__It's an exceptional film, not because of its protagonists' impressive triumphs, but because it honors their struggle.__As though it were the easiest thing in the world, "The Theory of Everything" juggles and elaborates on the three main areas of Hawking's life - his work, his illness and his marriage.
In the best dramedies, of course, laughter and tears alternate seamlessly and gracefully, and you leave both entertained and enlightened. Alas, this isn't that film.__Once in awhile, a reviewer's darkest suspicions about a film butt up against a sneaky pleasure in its incidental epiphanies. I confess to being conflicted.__Occasionally, Hollywood will step forward with a family drama that actually manages to tinker with actual pain... "This Is Where I Leave You" has no edge, no darkness, no texture, no character to speak of.__The most charitable thing you can say about This Is Where I Leave You is that it is resolutely innocuous -- a nothing of a movie, neutered and sanitary.__Mawkish, self-satisfied and false, This Is Where I Leave You strenuously attempts to wring poignancy from its familial clashes and catharsis. More often, it's cringe-inducing.__This Is Where I Leave You amounts to everything I can't stand about certain American movies. It gathers too many good, smart actors and gives most of them almost nothing interesting to play.__What a wasted opportunity.__A very ordinary film, particularly for one adapted from such a thoughtful and tonally tricky book.__This comedy about a death is a funeral for the audience. But, hey, here's your chance to sit shiva with an all-star cast.__Somewhere in this mess, there might be a very good movie.__As with so many movies where the script constructs experiences that are contrived and off-putting, you hope the actors can capture the emotional truth of some scenes, even if the entire apparatus feels bogus.__I can't think of a family I'd rather sit shiva with than the Altmans of "This Is Where I Leave You."__The movie toys with real emotions, with our emotions, in ways that are pat and writerly and button-pushing in the cheapest, cheesiest ways.__A movie needs to be more than pretty closeups and carefully set up punchlines, and "This Is Where I Leave You" rarely is.__A benign, gently naughty and rarely unpleasant dramatic comedy, the movie benefits from the kind of cast that can cover a lot of warts and keep the cookie cutter churning along.__With this movie, Hollywood seems more intent than ever on disproving Tolstoy: Each unhappy family is unhappy in exactly the same way.__It's easy to be impressed by the dramatic capabilities of actors known primarily for lighter fare - in particular, Jason Bateman and Tina Fey, both of whom are terrific.__Director Levy and screenwriter Jonathan Tropper, who adapted his own novel, tone down or eliminate the wildest incidents in the book, but they're true to its depiction of a pent-up, discordant clan on the verge of a group nervous breakdown.__Instead of smiles or tears, "This Is Where I Leave You" is most likely to inspire a Kickstarter campaign to reunite its main performers for a different project.__"This Is Where I Leave You" leaves you wanting - if not more, than at least better and smarter and more honest. The problem, finally, is that it's not nearly complicated enough.
The dialogue never leaves the surface and the running across Los Angeles that happens in the last sequence is supposed to thrill you, but it's such a cliche that your embarrassment extends to the crew member who has to follow with the camera.__Though Wahlberg is a fine actor, there's no way I can buy him as a college English professor holding forth on Shakespeare and Camus.__The hopeful ending comes off as too little, too late. Wahlberg gives the role his all, but sticking with him is a futile gesture. The Gambler never pays off. It's a sucker's bet.__As The Gambler becomes less about its protagonist's dashed intellectualism and more about the gathering danger of his predicament, the film gains power.__An agreeable if ridiculous slice of old-school Hollywood machismo ...__It's just like the Kenny Rogers song says: "You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em." It's time for this "Gambler" to walk away.__The return is as miniscule as the stakes.__If someone is really that intent on self-destruction, why should we be his audience?__A dull, self-consciously arty wallow in the messed-up life of a character we don't care about.__What's mostly missing from "The Gambler" is a sense of why Jim is so insistent on squandering his money, privilege and patrimony.__This certainly is one driven narrative. Wahlberg reportedly lost 60 lbs. for the role, and his gaunt look makes Jim seem all the more haunted as he repeatedly throws away vast sums on games of chance.__In a role that would have been ideal for Tom Cruise in psycho mode, Wahlberg is merely OK. Unfortunately, the film's effectiveness turns on whether we buy into his angst.__Another wet battery about a week in the life of a gambling addict.__By suppressing Wahlberg's more typical sparkling unpredictability, this new reading of the character recasts him into someone more frustrating than free.__The Gambler is a solid remake - a film that retraces the path of the original while carving out its own identity.__A string of powerful performances, particularly Wahlberg's, and a killer soundtrack - including M83, Dinah Washington and St. Paul & the Broken Bones - redeem a middling entertainment gambit.__The Gambler is about the torturous dissatisfaction some people feel when they've managed to do everything right but still don't feel fulfilled__This remake of the 1974 James Caan film written by James Toback ... crackles with mordant cynicism.__The Gambler is a hollow, overwrought and glibly cynical remake of a '70s drama about a self-destructive academic.__Low on action and tension, long on grand speeches. Wahlberg gets an A for effort in an unlikely role.
There's no getting past the nonsense formality of taking that camera everywhere.__The plot is a confusing, derivative mishmash of half-baked supernatural cliches, and the total absence of characterization makes it hard to care what happens.__The leads are appealing but the best scares will be familiar to anyone who has seen the previous films - or, for that matter, the trailer.__This fifth in the series further diminishes the promise of the 2007 original, replacing mystery and suspense with predictability and misogyny.__Provides the familiar cheap thrills but with a salsa tang.__Many of the core elements of the earlier movies are retained here, including the increasingly annoying found-footage gimmick.__There's no escaping that the found-footage phenomenon has gone from fresh and original to just plain annoying.__The Latino cast gives the movie a fresh, modern feel, but the underlying formula is becoming unacceptably stale.__The concept is the same, and just as tired as it was when the second, third and fourth sequels to Paranormal Activity's 2009 first installment.__Whereas the other Paranormal films rely on an escalation of terrors, The Marked Ones is characterized by long stretches of mundanity, occasionally interrupted by a cheap shock.__Landon co-wrote three of the previous entries, though this is his first time directing one, and he doesn't seem to know, or care, about the kinds of questions audiences may want answers to.__A shift in focus helps revive the low-budget horror series, despite the near-absence of returning cast members.__Pleasantly disposable 'Paranormal Activity' spinoff invests the found-footage horror franchise with some welcome diversity and humor.__The real terror of Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones is the horrifying thought that Blair Witch disease rages unabated, 15 years after the outbreak began.__Does anybody really find this crap scary anymore?__It's a welcome update, qualifying as the best in the series since the first film captivated and unnerved audiences in 2007.__While it's exciting to see a hit series take on an almost entirely Latino cast as just a matter of course, the new zigs only barely balance out all the familiar zags.__What comes next remains to be seen, but "Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones" feels like a fresh start.__None__None
Like an alternate version of Network in which Faye Dunaway cannibalizes the conscientious William Holden character, Nightcrawler cleverly dispenses with any debate about the tyranny of ratings and the erosion of privacy.__It seems like a lot of satirical hue and cry about a social problem I'm not sure the nation is currently plagued by. Are local TV news stations really conducting daily bidding wars over the goriest footage random freelancers can bring them?__Crashes and crime scenes are his bread and butter. He is driven. He is innovative. He is happy. He is also a monster - a fiend who preys on people at their weakest and worst moments.__Now 33 years old, Gyllenhaal is the same age that De Niro was in Taxi Driver and, like him, he is learning to channel an eerie, inner charisma, offering it up in glimpses and glimmers rather than all at once.__For a first-time director, Gilroy demonstrates an uncommon assurance, not only in his audacious tonal shifts but in the stellar work he elicits from his cast and crew.__A mesmerizing cipher, Lou is a spiritual descendant of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, and of the withholding protagonists in the existential French crime films of Robert Bresson and Jean-Pierre Melville__After a few minutes you know everything about Louis you're going to know; the only surprise in Nightcrawler is the level of grotesqueness it achieves.__[Gilroy] wants Louis, who perpetrates some ghastly escapades, to epitomize the sick soul of media exploitation, but he also celebrates him as an entrepreneurial go-getter who is just giving us hypocrites what we secretly (or not-so-secretly) crave.__Howard's intrusive score enhances the sense that Nightcrawler is a movie and nothing more. Which is fine, of course. But the movie's movie-ness makes you aware that a statement is being made without articulating what it is.__It's hard not to be fascinated by the dark places Gyllenhaal goes here. But "Nightcrawler" falls short as social commentary or even psychological yarn. Like Louis, it talks a good game that crumbles as you ponder it.__It's a 21st-century takedown of the media's pandering ''if it bleeds, it leads'' ethos and the ghoulish nightcrawlers who live by it.__A movie for the pleasure of movie audiences pretending to be shocked by a story of ghoulish media.__'Nightcrawler' manages to be a scathing look at ambition and journalistic sensationalism while still delivering as a dark thriller.__Nightcrawler savages the news media's ratings-driven ethic (a most unethical ethic) with such force, it brings to mind Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet's Network.__"Nightcrawler" executes its ideas with tremendous craft and cool, and the courageous and counterintuitive pairing of its leads - Russo is 60, and Gyllenhaal 33 - produces two electrical, interlocking performances and undeniable erotic chemistry.__This isn't fun, escapist entertainment but, when it works, it's fascinating and compelling and makes us take a hard look at what TV news is selling and where it's getting the product.__A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone.__It's a solid first time out in any event, entertainingly obvious at some points, obvious-obvious at others, and jazzed to have a rich subject and a star willing to run with it.__Nightcrawler serves as a phenomenal showcase for Gyllenhaal, who is never less than riveting . A full package of tics, tension and breathless patter, this self-taught entrepreneur stops at nothing, evoking a Taxi Driver for the TMZ age.__Writer-director Dan Gilroy wants it both ways - snarling comedy and gripping thriller - and for the most part he gets what he wants.
It's such a treat to see such an endearing slice o' life in the middle of this blockbuster season. There's not a single comic book character in sight.__Chef is compelling, somewhat convincing and, according to many who know better than I, it's largely on trend.__Favreau has assembled a terrific cast for a road trip that is joyous and revelatory, all set to a great soundtrack ...__It's a refreshing change of pace from typical summer fare, a story not framed around the skeleton of an old TV series or designed as a tie-in to Hasbro toys.__If "Chef" were a musical, you'd walk out humming the food - and you might end up doing that anyway.__Chef is so thin and bland it doesn't even inspire contempt.__Best of all is Favreau. Instead of mass-producing another superhero epic, he has given the overfed public a dish of right-sized comfort food. Whatever he cooks up in the future, it will be hard to top "Chef."__Jon Favreau's bouncy paean to the culinary arts wins you over in a stridently upbeat, crowd-pleasing way ...__A colorful, great-looking film, with an infectious soundtrack.__Chef is lightweight, and could be seen as just a blatant attempt to cash in on the whole food-truck phenomenon, but it's so engaging that it really doesn't matter.__You know these ingredients; it's how they're served that counts.__There's nothing terribly profound about "Chef." But its message - that relationships, like cooking, take a hands-on approach - is a sweet and sustaining one.__The movie's problems aren't small: It moves slowly, meanders everywhere and never quite arrives at a destination.__There are enough satisfying flavor notes in "Chef" to make it a tasty repast, even if the film bears too much of a resemblance to the unadventurous menu the food critic pans.__Jon Favreau's charming comedy about a chef trying to carve out a living accomplishes exactly what it needs to: It makes your stomach growl, your mouth water and your brain vow to track down the nearest medianoche.__No matter how you slice it, "Chef" is authentic cuisine.__Favreau's masterly light touch as an actor hasn't yet translated to a similarly deft offhandedness behind the camera. The movie, slick and shallow, is fairly entertaining anyway.__Although overly familiar, the behind-the-scenes food shenanigans are often lively and sharply written.__Chef won't knock your socks off, but it believes in itself - and for Favreau, that's all that matters.__If you want the cinematic version of a dim sum brunch, or cocktail hour at a tapas bar - lots of little plates, good flavors and uncomplicated fun - "Chef" has a table saved, just for you.
Chadwick Boseman gives a startling and galvanic performance.__In Boseman's hands - and his feet, and his entire body, for that matter - he demands and earns our attention.__Somewhat sanitized and over-directed biopic saved by Boseman's electric performance.__More often, the film skates along the surface of Brown's contradictory character. Now if it skated like Brown's dance moves glided onstage, that really would have been something.__The storytelling is mostly linear, with some confusing back-and-forth in the chronology, and it's a long slog. The Brown who emerges from this film has a monstrous ego to go with his monster talent.__Tate Taylor's film cares less about narrative clarity and more about portraying a life lived between the extremes of sin and grace, between the abject and the sublime. It's lively, stylized, and genuinely surprising.__Thrives on a thrilling soundtrack, a doozy of a yarn and Chadwick Boseman's dynamite-powered portrayal of Brown.__Boseman is at times mesmerizing, living up to the gargantuan task of playing the American soul legend. If only the movie were as good as he is.__A well-acted entertainment that's highly respectful of the story it has to tell. It's disjointed but fun to watch.__Whatever failings the film may have, none can be laid at the feet of lead actor Chadwick Boseman, whose performance is phenomenal.__"Get on Up" turns Brown's life into an even bigger mess.__"Get on Up" is more frustrating than fulfilling, a disjointed film that suffers from having a more ambitious plan than it's got the ability to execute.__It avoids the predictable narrative arc - hardscrabble youth, rise to fame, descent into drugs, etc. - by scrambling the Brown chronology and shooting for a more thematic organizing structure marked by smart transitions.__Unexpectedly buoyant; it skims over a life as if tunefully improvising, touching just the right note here and there.__A messy, qualified triumph that even at 138 minutes makes an incomplete case for Brown's meaning to American life and culture, but a triumph nevertheless.__Even as a musical celebration, the movie is a misfire. Instead of re-creating the ecstatic, improvisatory flow of Brown's stage act, the film cuts almost everything into glittering bits and pieces.__Before and after everything else, "Get On Up" is about the transformative power of performance.__Straightforward but highly entertaining.__"Get on Up" is loud, proud, funky, soulful, sweaty, emphatic and sometimes a little hard to understand, just like its subject, James Brown.__If Chadwick Boseman's turn as Jackie Robinson last year in "42" made him a star, his flashy performance in James Brown biopic "Get On Up" adds another layer of shine.
Charlie's Angels director McG used to know how to marshal a decent action scene (if nothing else), but that touch seems to have deserted him.__Every gag is premised on the fact that Renner allows his work and personal lives to overlap, though this contradicts everything we've been told about him and would obviously heighten the risk to his loved ones.__Pure trash but it's entertaining as hell.__The movie never finds a way to blend the emotional and the rat-a-tat-tat into one seamless package the way that Besson did in his one and only good movie, The Professional.__How did 3 Days to Kill, which doesn't have the worst imaginable premise, turn out this bad?__To the degree that the film works, it's because Costner plays the straight man.__A comic-tragic-sentimental genre hodgepodge that wants to make you feel all the feelings amid all that action spectacle. It doesn't entirely deliver, but at times you can't help but admire its strangeness.__Just sit back and enjoy. "3 Days to Kill" is big dumb fun anchored by a good actor's refusal to take himself too seriously.__It's the modern dilemma: how to balance work with family, get the job done, and still have time to share a meal with the wife and kid.__A scattershot McG action/comedy/romance/drama, the closest our era has to the audience-pleasing ambitions of William Wyler, if Wyler had first gotten drunk on Bud Light Lime.__3 Days To Kill is one Liam Neeson shy of a Liam Neeson vehicle.__Long before Kevin Costner is demanding pasta sauce info at gunpoint from a terrified Italian hostage in 3 Days to Kill, it's obvious no one is following any kind of coherent recipe for this movie.__The result is a little like baby bear's porridge, neither all bad nor all good, though not quite right yet either.__The idea seems to have been to explore how little sense a movie could make, and how little that could matter, and also to allow Mr. Costner to indulge in some good-natured sadism and a bit of middle-aged sentimentality.__[A] bloated, queasy, quasi-comical extravaganza.__"3 Days," though not without pleasures, doesn't seem to know what it is; it's three not-quite-good-enough movies, all in one.__Contrived and manic, Days can't decide whether it's a thriller, comedy or feel-good family film.__It's like a bad Liam Neeson actioner crossed with a worse American sitcom, and it's a mess.__Like Ethan, "3 Days to Kill" has a job to do, but it prefers to shoot first and ask questions later.__Kids, don't drink and write or you could cause an accident like the script for "3 Days to Kill."
An impressively staged climactic exorcism compensates in part for the random, far-fetched storytelling that precedes it.__If you didn't know that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie, the boot prints on your eardrums would've clued you in.__Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, Paul Harris Boardman, deliver a routine procedural with unremarkable frights.__Director Scott Derrickson demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo), though just as many feel uninspired.__It's time for Derrickson, who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose, to master a new ritual.__A surprisingly strong cast and solid direction make all the malarkey in this horror flick tolerable.__A pretty routine and occasionally silly demonic-possession flick, which distinguishes itself by making us wait so long for the exorcism that heads may be spinning in the audience as well.__The movie is never boring. The atmosphere is decidedly unsettling and a viewer will jump a few times. Even the acting is fairly solid.__Luckily for Derrickson, this devil hates light bulbs, causing Ralph to spend countless scenes wandering around in the dark waiting to be startled by a cat.__After a while, the film's grim, desolate settings come off not so much as a landscape of moral squalor (as in Se7en), but as a tedious attempt to add gravity to a thoroughly generic horror tale.__If this movie doesn't leave you howling at the very idea of demonic possession, you're in dire need of an exorcist.__Just another dumb riff on The Exorcist ...__"Deliver Us From Evil'' expertly serves shivers, buckets of gore - and pretty much every cliche of the genre.__While the supernatural side of the film suffers a flaw or two ... its central conflict works.__Too silly to be scary, and a bit too dull to be a midnight-movie guilty pleasure.__It's not the possession but the predictability that'll make your head spin.__It's all cliched, of course, and has been since "The Exorcist" ... but it's still effective, perhaps more so with anyone who, like our hero cop, comes from the world of scented smoke and altar boys.__"Evil" doesn't shy away from grisly images. But the scares don't last ...__Like other entries of its pulpish ilk, the picture packs lots of violence, a fair bit of gore, and plenty of cheap scares.__The film is said to be based on the case files of a real-life cop-turned-demonologist. Instead, it seems to have been inspired by a stack of rejected horror-movie scripts found in a studio dumpster.
When the Game Stands Tall is one of those cliche-riddled feel good movies that, by trying too hard to be inspirational, ends up as cloying and overly sentimental.__The real-life story behind When the Game Stands Tall sounds amazing. But for all its exciting sports scenes, the movie version falls flat as drama.__Why must an extraordinary story beget such an ordinary film?__A true tale of high school football achievement becomes a strained, by-the-numbers grab bag of uplift in the Christian sports drama "When the Game Stands Tall."__When the Game Stands Tall is more manipulative than a hulking chiropractor. It's so busy beatifying its protagonist that it makes him into a grave idol rather than a man.__High school football can be described as a religion in many parts of America. Sappily melodramatic When the Game Stands Tall skips the middle man and blends both in a weak-willed, cliched biopic of California coach Bob Ladouceur.__The movie raises religious and philosophical questions about whether what we put out in the world is returned to us, but it sticks with the ultimate American answer: There is no problem so great that winning a football game won't solve it.__In the end, the only real impact is limited to a few scenes ...__It's as if the filmmakers somehow think they've got the relaxed narrative confines of "Friday Night Lights" the TV series to play with, rather than "Friday Night Lights" the movie. The game plan is flawed.__Overall, "When the Game Stands Tall" feels like a post-loss locker-room speech: meaningful, but less than inspirational.__When it comes down to fourth and goal, the movie is more about moving the pigskin than moving the audience.__When the Game Stands Tall feels as if it will connect with the audiences at which it's aimed.__The game footage is outstanding, very realistic. Even when the outcome of games is never in question - which is often - it's still exciting to watch.__[The film] makes a commendable effort to invest the inspirational sports movie with some deeper meaning but simultaneously labors to keep all the genre cliches firmly in place.__Undeserving of a victory dance__The greater narrative always remains on track, often leading to unexpected places.__It's easier to appreciate what When The Games Stands Tall doesn't do than it is to admire what it does.__'When the Game Stands Tall" is nearly as good as the average episode of TV's "Friday Nights Lights," which makes it better than most movies and one of the better sports films of recent years.__Goes long on rectitudinous sermonizing but comes up short on gridiron thrills or genuine love for the game.__I walked out of the theater feeling like I'd seen an extremely glossy docudrama.
Ivan Reitman's dull-witted movie about the flurries of player trading on N.F.L. draft day might be a commercial for professional football.__A human drama sprinkled with a number of laughs.__Draft Day isn't even really about football. It's about coming into your own and finding clarity at a personal and professional crossroads. It's about doing your job. It's a day in the life.__Thanks to Costner's sly, dry-aged charisma, it marches down the field and scores.__"Draft Day" might be a trick play, but it manages to score.__It's a sign of Costner's enduring stardom that he can skate through a movie this hyperactive and dull, yet still have you like him.__The film has its share of entertaining clashes and reconciliations.__Reitman may have his drawbacks but no one has ever accused his films of lacking heart. With sports movies especially, ya gotta have heart.__There's plenty of shimmying here, maybe too much, and lots of spin moves, but it's missing on-the-field results.__You may think you're not interested in a sturdy little dramatic comedy about the intricacies of the NFL draft process. But with Draft Day, you're in the hands of a master.__When one looks deeply enough, this is as much about the personalities of the characters as it is about the trades they're involved in.__It's about gamesmanship. About judging character, fast. And yes, about grown sons, and father's shadows. Also about some smart filmmaking.__When you don't just have commercials before the movies, but the movies themselves have become commercials, something has gone wrong.__The NFL gets a "special thanks" in the end credits. Maybe it should have been the other way around.__Not destined for Costner's personal hall of fame.__Even people who aren't football fans will appreciate the maneuvers and the high-stakes trading, the make-or-break strategies and the careers in the balance.__Though "Draft Day" feels far less authentic than the baseball-themed "Moneyball," it can be amusing to watch all this inside football stuff if you are an NFL fan.__At times the film seems like a highlight reel interrupted by a forgettable movie.__A shallow and evasive movie, built more around corporate wish fulfillment than around reality ...__This slow-burning wheeler-dealer football drama pays off in the end, but it would be a lot more entertaining along the way if it were loose and irreverent.
Oculus is about one adjustment away from being a superior thriller.__Praised on the festival circuit, it's got what it takes to succeed outside of that rarefied atmosphere.__What's missing? A sense of the ineffable.__Oculus, a cleverer-than-average haunted-house movie... speaks to a couple of widespread anxieties-one topical, the other sadly timeless.__"Reaches right through you and chills you to the bone."__As far as competence goes, Oculus doesn't have so little as to be accidentally entertaining or enough to come close to working.__A deeply silly and mildly effective horror movie about two young-adult siblings coping with the mysterious deaths of their parents.__For a horror movie, Oculus is surprisingly lean on the scares. It's more interested in playing tricks with perception and bending reality.__It's just a little vague, a little familiar, a little fake.__"Oculus" is haunting because it messes with your head. That's where the ghosts are.__What makes Oculus ingenious is how Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard take this hackneyed storyline and twist it - round 'n' round - ad infinitum into a dizzying corkscrew of a narrative.__The elegant use of wide screen can't totally obscure stiff acting, and the rug pulling finally seems arbitrary. When nothing can be trusted, the mirage of suspense disappears.__Less concerned with fake shocks and show-me violence than the grimly calibrated rotting of personalities, "Oculus" is one of the more intelligently nasty horror films in recent memory.__Originally a 30-minute short, director Mike Flanagan and his co-writer Jeff Howard's thin scenario does not improve when expanded to feature length.__It's far more intelligent and haunting than most chillers these days, but near the end I kept wishing it would lighten up and be entertaining.__As Oculus builds toward its gruesome (but not unexpected) finale, the characters get lost in a series of hallucinations and flashbacks that don't amount to much other than eat up screen time.__"Oculus" director Mike Flanagan has crafted a satisfyingly old-fashioned ghost story that, in its evocation of shivery dread, is the most unnerving poltergeist picture since "The Conjuring."__It's never actually scary.__"Oculus" is not just a howling good horror film. It's a terrific film by any standard - a smart, character-driven, original hair-raiser that creeped the socks off me with no cheap scares.__Flanagan's a skillful director and editor, and simply by placing the camera in logical but unusual places ... the tension increases moment by moment, ghost by ghost, frightening reflection by reflection.
The melodrama feels so hurried and half-baked that the end result isn't just disappointing. It's borderline infuriating.__The sunlight is golden, the accent's rural (this one's set in Louisiana), people die, sagacious letters are read aloud.__For all of the eventfulness it jams into a (poorly edited) two-hour package, The Best Of Me ends up extracting the best of absolutely no one.__As a drama, it fails, but the camp value is high, making it more fun than your average would-be weeper. It's silly, but at least it's not a slog.__Interminably long, dragging out its molasses heart through what seem like three different endings.__We've seen this story told in similar fashion so many times in the past. I only wish we could have had it delivered in a fresher, less cliche-filled package.__The latest gaseous emission from the Sparks melodrama machine.__An opposites-in-love-then-apart-then-back-and-maybe-but-no! weepie seesaw that could test even the most amenable to Sparks-ian heart-tugging.__The only thing "The Best of Me" really wants is to weave a teary-eyed romantic spell by any means necessary.__Isn't fate a funny thing? Especially when Nicholas Sparks makes it up.__The Best of Me is not the worst adaptation of Nicholas Sparks, but audiences can certainly choose better.__A love story about as moving and genuine as a ballad crooned by a studio-manufactured boy band.__This tale of two former lovers reuniting after a 21-year separation also functions as a study of two terrific actors struggling to overcome the relentless mediocrity of their material.__Sinks like a rock thrown into a sun-dappled lake shaded by magnolia trees sparkling under a sky of shooting stars.__The actors are appealing enough and Hoffman's direction calm enough to qualify "Best" as better than its predecessors. That's rather like calling it the tallest midget, however ...__"The Best of Me" to actual romance what pro wrestling is to actual sports: A loud, overdone mix of sweaty clinches and implausible events leading to a conclusion you knew well before the start, never mind before the end.__The Best Of Me is neither the best Sparks adaptation, nor the worst; it's merely the most recent.__Sparks would be delighted if this movie were compared to his other story about reunited lovers, but compared to "The Notebook," "The Best of Me" is the coffee-stained outline of a sales pitch for sleeping pills.__Like the artificially sweetened junk food it is, this all goes down pretty easily.__All the laughs are unintentional.
Frank's film is much more of a noir outing than a straight action feature, and Neeson slips right into the tone and feel of the hard-boiled detective offering.__As a throwback to a type of nasty, ugly crime film of yesteryear, A Walk Among the Tombstones cleans up.__As nauseating as the film's inventive sadisms can be, Frank succeeds far more in the details than in the larger picture that tries to relate this world to ours.__While we're waiting for the release of Taken 3, the man who was Oskar Schindler is keeping us in an action hero frame of mind with the moody-but-essentially-empty A Walk Among the Tombstones.__As usual, Neeson gives a more thoughtful performance than the material deserves.__If this is your kind of movie, it's hard to find one better made.__You expect a thriller from a movie like this, but the further into the case Scudder trudges, the more soundly and unexpectedly Tombstones is able to hit the sweet spot of any good suspense film: the pit of your stomach.__This is a stylish and smart thriller.__It's clear from the sunless palette and the measured, one-thing-after-another pacing that Frank loves Block's work, and that goes a long way. The performances go a long way, too.__Overplotted and underexplained ...__This ghost of a movie star is never more at home than when walking among the tombstones.__It has the steady pace of a police procedural, with a flawed but noble hero and the colorful lowlifes that populate any hard-boiled mystery scribe's world.__Frank ... keeps things tense enough that we may not have time to notice one or two failings in the script.__Teaming a tarnished hero with violated bad guys is a compelling idea, and ought to make for more sparks than we get here.__"A Walk Among the Tombstones" is the creepiest film I've seen in quite some time, and that's not meant as a compliment.__Frank mostly overdoses on portentousness as he roots his solid hero in a city that fears coming to pieces.__With the combo of Neeson's natural solemnity and his action chops, "Tombstones" treads compellingly amongst lesser thrillers.__A solid entry into the film noir genre.__"A Walk Among the Tombstones" feels like one of its villains: spiteful, sadistic and amoral.__Nasty, brutal and unforgiving, "A Walk Among the Tombstones" is one of those rare contemporary cinematic offerings: intelligent pulp.
The refreshing thing about this otherwise formulaic romantic comedy is that writer-director Tom Gormican gives the verbal humor some rhythm, shooting many of the dialogue-driven scenes in long takes so they develop a pleasing ebb and flow.__A moderately smart movie would have pushed back against the formula. That Awkward Moment simply mistakes being obnoxious for being clever.__The movie's ideas about relationships would've felt middle-of-the-road in the '80s, and its big epiphany moments (Guys can fall in love, too!) are shallow enough to make you long for the comparatively profound rom-com oeuvre of Kate Hudson.__First-time writer-director Tom Gormican keeps the dialogue moving at a rapid pace, which doesn't obscure the fact that most of what is said is dopey and witless.__Only a sociopath would behave this carelessly, and as such, That Awkward Moment makes for an interesting study in abnormal criminal behavior.__Take three horny guys, all twentysomethings, mix with a plot that was old last century, and serve to an audience so desperate toilet gags they might forgive a movie wired only with cliches.__Might be more aptly titled Those Awkward 94 Minutes.__"That Awkward Moment" wants to be part "American Pie" and part "Swingers." It doesn't get there, but thanks to its cast, watching it try has its moments.__A vile, witless sex comedy ...__Part of its problem is infantilism.__Though it ultimately leans too much on genre cliche, it reveals some of the tensions that today's young adults experience in their romantic lives - the impersonality of hook-up culture in collision with the human desire and need for intimacy.__Even though "Awkward" has its moments, it winds up lagging behind more daring endeavors on TV right now. The film industry had better keep up.__What "Awkward" is actually about, albeit unintentionally, is how passing off misogyny for comedy has gotten so terribly passe, as insulting to the guys as to the young women.__There are times when the blend of romance and raunchiness threatens to curdle. In the end, however, the "love conquers all" mentality wins out.__The chief frustration of "That Awkward Moment" is that everyone in it is so much better than the material ...__That Awkward Moment is pleasant enough, and it has some inspired moments, but they don't add up to anything that pushes the boundaries of the genre.__"That Awkward Moment" does invert one of Hollywood's more tiresome cliches - the one where the distraught woman consoles herself by eating a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. In this movie, it's the guy who does that.__A bungled mass of relationship gab and frat-friendly gross-out gags, with the latter, and most of the laughs, front-loaded into the first few reels.__A movie that checks absolutely every box and still utterly fails the test.__Drags the most ridiculous and cliched elements of the worst of female-centred romcoms into a male arena and calls it entertainment.
We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous.__While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane.__It's like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness.__A word about the film's epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching.__Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life.__An exceptionally well-crafted coming-of-age story.__The closest thing to a lived life that fictional cinema has yet produced.__Linklater has crafted what may be the most ingenious film of the century here and given it a tone like no other ...__Is it dumb to say, "Wow?" I don't care. Wow.__The year's most captivating narrative experiment, and possibly the most engrossing coming-of-age movie in the history of the genre.__Boyhood understands the tumult of childhood and adolescence as well as it does the hurdles and satisfaction of raising children.__Richard Linklater's latest feels more like living a life than watching a movie. It's a one-of-a-kind experience.__Any film that takes twelve years to shoot should be commended for its stamina alone; yet no sense of grind, still less of fatigue, attends this Richard Linklater project.__I can't help but think there may have been a better movie still lurking in his accumulated footage, one that with a mild shift in emphasis might have been titled, more ambitiously, Adulthood.__Few filmmakers ever make a great movie. Fewer still ever make a movie that expands what movies can express. Richard Linklater does both with Boyhood.__So, while it's tempting to say that nothing happens in Boyhood, that would be wrong. What happens is everything.__"Boyhood" is a stunt, an epic, a home video, and a benediction. It reminds us of what movies could be and - far more important - what life actually is.__To say Boyhood wouldn't be that special if it were shot in a conventional manner is kind of like saying that elephant in the zoo wouldn't be so big if it weren't so big.__Linklater's writing is typically warm and insightful, and the cast is uniformly excellent, including Ellar Coltrane as the quiet, down-to-earth hero.__"Boyhood" is not just a great movie, it's a landmark achievement in film.
Chris Rock's Top Five is very funny -- no surprise there -- but it's also unexpectedly romantic.__A seriously funny, semi-autobiographical film that might be the most accomplished work Chris Rock has ever done for the big screen.__Like Rock's best stand-up shows, Top Five mixes the sweet with the salty, the naughty with the remarkably kind. It celebrates the darkly hilarious with the light of whip-smart observations.__For an ostensibly soul-deep movie like this to work, we need more than smirks and scowls.__Top Five finds Rock in an elevated form, at 49. Things change, sometimes for the better.__Extremely enjoyable ...__It's fun to watch Chris Rock; it's just fun. And there are parts of this film where it's fun to watch him in exactly the ways he wants it to be.__Welcome back, Chris Rock.__[Rock is] still not all the way there in "Top Five," his third effort as writer-director-star. But the movie has so many laughs it hardly matters.__An innovative take on familiar material, Top Five is an exquisitely paced, rich, idiosyncratic, satirical, yet deeply moving free-form comedy about a Hollywood star who is shadowed for one day by a New York Times reporter.__It's a slap-happy movie and often scurrilously funny - the sound of a gifted comic mind finally finding its onscreen voice.__A romantic comedy that's also an extended riff on art, identity, authenticity and what it means to be a black entertainer ...__The movie, which alternates between hilariously vulgar gags and some electric improvs and riffs by Rock and his cast of all-stars, has the crackle and pop of a live performance - it energizes you.__The movie marks the first time Rock's stand-up persona - cutting, vulnerable, afraid of no sacred cows - has survived intact on the way to the multiplex. That alone is reason for fans to celebrate.__Rock is on a roll again.__To the writing, Rock brings the discipline of his stand-up. Even with some improvisation, there is not one throwaway line in this fat-free script.__It can be delightful, intelligent, crude, clumsy and culturally tone-deaf, depending on which scene is rolling by. One minute it's a major letdown, the next minute a joy to watch.__Raunchy in extremis, often funny and at times touching, "Top Five" is Chris Rock's sincere attempt to craft a film career largely detached from his stand-up clowning.__The sweetest surprise in this raunchy comic ride is how artfully Rock lets down his guard. His confident, prowling wit as a stand-up has finally found its way to the screen, enhanced by a bracing vulnerability.__Mr. Rock has made a pyrotechnic pinwheel of a personal comedy, and he's had the wisdom to share it with a strong co-star. While he sends sparks flying every which way, Rosario Dawson keeps the story grounded in calm intelligence and classic romance.
The spy who bored me.__It's a serviceable, pleasingly CGI-unenhanced run-and-gun flick I will find on Encore Action after midnight a year-and-a-half from now and watch for 17 minutes before remembering I've already seen it.__There's nothing terribly wrong with The November Man in a serviceable late-night cable TV sort of way but neither is there anything terribly right about it. It's unnecessary and derivative.__The November Man is one of those thrillers that grows progressively more incoherent, and it simply isn't fast enough to glide over its gaping narrative holes.__[An] engaging, fast-paced and ultimately ludicrous combo of espionage and mayhem ...__A predictable espionage thriller undercut further by loose ends left dangling, November Man is worth seeing only for Pierce Brosnan's dynamic lead performance.__It's unfortunate that the shrewdness -- dare I say thought? -- that went into shaping Brosnan's aging hero doesn't extend to the rest of the movie.__"The November Man" turns out to be the classic August movie: a triumph of competence over imagination and schlock over taste. Its highest value lies in reminding filmgoers that fall can't come too soon.__Director Roger Donaldson has had his ups and downs over the past few years; the script for this lodges somewhere in the middle, though he compensates for its lack of distinction through sheer velocity and nimble negotiation of its hairpin turns.__If it doesn't transcend its genre origins, I suspect it's because it doesn't want to.__When The November Man stays pulpy, its cheesier aspects-like a low-rent supporting cast and a gratuitous sex scene-seem like par for the course. When it turns more serious, so do its failings.__As far as escapist fluff laced with totally unnecessary real-world horror goes, The November Man isn't wretched.__The utter lack of originality eventually sinks the movie, and the climax has more howlers than a wolf convention.__"The November Man" is a sturdy-enough addition to the action spy (as opposed to the thoughtful spy) canon. It shoots straight, runs fast and is thoroughly, almost convincingly, paranoid.__Brosnan ... slips back into his intel identity with seeming effortlessness. The watchfulness, the calm, the jujitsu moves, the walking-through-rooms-with-the gun-held-straight-out-in-front-of-you stuff.__Some like it cold. And that seems to be Brosnan's aim here - showing us someone who enjoys his license to kill so much, he's forgotten some of his reason to live.__Sadly, the film rapidly devolves into an AARP version of a Jason Bourne-like vendetta, only bloodier and less meaningful.__Often frustrating and at times incomprehensible, the Bourne/Bond clone keeps the pulse racing but ultimately fails to satisfy.__It's called "The November Man," but it's really just another forgettable August release.__Although "The November Man" shows us some attractive people in motion, the cumulative effect leaves us neither shaken nor stirred.
None of the players exhibits much personality, but it's hard to fault them, given how thinly the characters have been imagined by screenwriters Shana Feste and Joshua Safran.__Things go desperately wrong after the opening promise ...__Endless Love lives up to its name. It's purgatory.__This remake has almost nothing to do with Spencer's novel. It's the kind of film you make when you've run out of Nicholas Sparks books.__Why does Hollywood continue to starve audiences longing for a good romantic tearjerker? Endless Love didn't have to be this godawful.__"Endless Love" isn't so much a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film as it is an extended ad for the idyllic Abercrombie & Fitch lifestyle.__A jaw-dropping groanfest of teen romance cliches ...__This new "Endless Love" doesn't have enough going on to make it memorably terrible: Banality is its gravest sin.__Wilde has one of those faces cameras love, thus her other career as a model. There are suggestions in "Endless" that she might have acting talent too. But the director rarely asks.__Might as well be one long montage of yearning gazes, tender kisses and lovers splashing in sundry bodies of water like playful otters.__Endless Love tells the story of star-crossed lovers, beautifully.__There are remakes, readaptations and reboots, and then there is "Endless Love," a movie that bears almost no resemblance to its source material whatsoever.__This stinker is only good for endless laughs.__A box of Valentine's Day sweets that's rather too sugary, "Endless Love" goes even milder than the campy, nougat-filled 1981 Brooke Shields version.__[An] air-brushed, simple-minded remake ...__What does this new version offer? A different set of actors, a Valentine's Day release date and kissing. Lots of kissing. Kissing in place of character development and dialogue, even entire kissing montages where a meaningful plot should be.__A sunny, overlong pastiche of tropes, the kind that suggest love involves nothing more than holding hands and jumping off a dock into a lake, or having slow, teary-eyed sex in front of a fireplace, inexplicably blazing in mid-June.__A movie just begging to go up in the flames of camp. If only somebody had brought a match.__The real victim in all of this is Spencer, who is still writing books and must watch his tragic novel about dangerous obsession and true heartbreak get mangled anew every two generations.__Shana Feste's flatly generic update manages to make Franco Zeffirelli's gauzy 1981 romance look like a masterpiece of psychosexual intrigue.
Is it wrong to root for the volcano?__Parmageddon is nigh in this cheesy action melodrama that feels both overheated with plot developments, yet strangely curdled from a lack of histrionics that might have redeemed it as fun trash.__Narrative has never been Anderson's strength; the story here is a corny overhaul of James Cameron's already-corny Titanic.__No matter how much lava is afoot, there's always time to impale one more person with a sword.__A mindless but watchable fondue pot of high-calorie visuals and ready-made plotting ...__More fun than any civilization's fiery extinction should ever be, Paul W.S. Anderson's Pompeii 3-D is gloriously exciting kitsch - a poor man's Titanic crossed with an even poorer man's Gladiator.__Pompeii, the new historical-kitsch disaster movie, raises the question: Is there something about ancient classical settings that inspires actors to act badly?__Pompeii is a big, glorious, cheesy mess.__It's a spectacle all right - but mostly just of a lot of people, some of whom should know better, making an utter ash of themselves.__Like its director's horror hybrids, Pompeii values self-determination over survival, which makes for better, brisker, less convoluted genre storytelling.__Pompeii has as much to do with realism and history as the average gas station has with gourmet cuisine and fine dining. If you're hankering for something substantive, you'll leave hungry.__If there were a hint of a sense of play or humor in the filmmaking, beyond a briefly amusing moment of comeuppance for a foppish slaveowner, Pompeii might be a fun February diversion instead of a dull, eye-rolling slog.__Pompeii is a Titanic wannabe with a romance between a rich girl and a poor boy set against a natural disaster.__In "Pompeii," Mr. Anderson's latest 3-D extravaganza, and his first film without Ms. Jovovich since 2008, he seems to be without visual focus.__Harington transformed his body for the role, but here's the real disaster: His startlingly defined six-pack abs are the most memorable part of his character.__Part sword-and-sandal spectacle, part disaster epic, "Pompeii" accomplishes its ambitious agenda to largely engrossing effect.__You wonder if Paul W.S. Anderson is a director who might feel disrespected.__One of the most bloodless films to ever kill thousands of people in a fell swoop.__The drama is deadly but the volcano's a blast, making Pompeii something less than the complete disaster you might expect.__A campy guilty pleasure that serves up a "Gladiator'' knockoff as an appetizer to the impressively flame-filled main course.
The movie is rhythmless, shapeless, and, with the exception of a few shots, cheesy-looking.__Remember when paycheck-hungry actors were accused of phoning in a performance? Johnny Depp spins that for millennials in Transcendence by Skpying in his performance.__When it's all over, you will turn on your iPhone and ask Siri to find you a good restaurant for a bite to eat near the theater. And you will have learned nothing.__"Transcendence" is a moronic stew of competing impulses - bad science meets bad sociology meets bad theology ...__One of those "control technology or it will control you" sermons that nonetheless enlists the usual heap of technically advanced special effects.__Transcendence doesn't induce paranoia, wonder, or suspense. It's the most incurious film you could make about something as simultaneously preposterous and promising as Johnny Depp the Internet.__The script by first-time screenwriter Jack Paglen is so full of half-explained cyber-nonsense and wheezy, kneejerk man-vs.-technology cliches, it borders on the ludicrous.__Moderately entertaining, periodically draggy.__The poster for the film begs for a counter-punch: printed over a gloomy close-up of Depp there is the warning, "Yesterday Dr. Will Caster Was Only Human." To which we might add, "And the Day Before Johnny Depp was an Actor."__As a human tragedy of man and monster, of beauty and beast, it has just enough genuine pathos that you wish it were better.__The directorial debut for ace cinematographer Wally Pfister is always watchable, but the narrative flaws and logical leaps sabotage sustained enjoyment. "Transcendence" looks and sounds like a Christopher Nolan film that got attacked by malware.__The question of whether we're too tied to technology and when or if it will prove our downfall is undoubtedly important and probably somewhat pressing. It certainly deserves a better movie than "Transcendence."__Soon the worlds of technology and humanity collide - super-medicine, super-intelligence, super-ecosystems, super-confusing!__Lost in the land of mind over matter, Transcendence is too much trance and not nearly enough dance.__Bold, beautiful, sometimes confounding flight of futuristic speculation firmly rooted in the potential of today's technology.__An ambitious and provocative piece of work that is intriguingly balanced between being a warning and a celebration.__Transcendence is fairly ridiculous, but some may prefer its grand, loopy ambition to the small-minded sameness of so many futuristic thrillers.__Unfortunately, it takes more than grand concepts to make a movie and the lack of cinematic connective tissue is apparent in this poorly focused, meandering, and ultimately disappointing film.__A dark, lurchingly entertaining pastiche of age-old worries, future-shock jolts, hot-button topics and old-fashioned genre thrills.__Includes some genuine chemistry between Depp and Hall, which puts heart and soul into this machine.
This is ultimately a movie about class warfare and social oppression that isn't remotely science-fictional. It's real, and as dumb as this remake is, it sends you home thinking.__Follows the bog-standard formula perfected by Besson: combining functional storylining with competent action highlights and an occasional air of whimsy.__It's fun to see Walker do a double take at a perilous move of Belle's and then find a less risky alternative. The pair seem like they're having a good time in this buddy action movie. It seems a fitting curtain call for a likable actor gone too soon.__Almost no one in this film is allowed to play to their strengths.__It should be wilder, funnier, nuttier.__Brick Mansions is a non-starter: It chokes on its deja vu, the hyperactive Mixmaster editing is exhausting and the characters' banter is so leaden it might violate federal emission standards.__Director Camille Delamarre does a sloppy job of piecing everything together, and nobody on screen seems invested in what is going on. The feeling from the audience is mutual.__The action may be serious, but "Brick Mansions" doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a ridiculous movie that has the decency to acknowledge that it's ridiculous.__Wait, haven't we seen this before?__See it for Belle. See it for the parkour. And for the wonderfully magical spectacle of a man, flying.__High on stuntwork and low on logic ...__A D-grade action flick with nothing to recommend it beyond a cacophony of mind-numbingly generic action sequences ...__Dystopia's supposed to be worse than what's in the papers, fellas. Try to keep up.__There's vaulting and flipping galore as well as the customary ration of fistfights, shoot-outs, car chases and general mayhem that should satisfy hardcore action fans.__It is a hoot to watch, even if, to be honest, there's little reason for it to exist.__Director Camille Delamarre (Taken 2) relies heavily on camera trickery, speeding up and slowing down as needed to highlight jumps and stunts but in between the action scenes, tedium takes over.__The action sequences of "Mansions" are edited within an inch of their lives, adding more incoherence than thrills.__Mr. Delamarre is not an action virtuoso, but his visual style, heavily indebted to the Grand Theft Auto video games, is appropriately rough and kinetic.__There's not enough of Belle's artistry here, given that part of the remake mandate presumably was to deliver something even bigger and better.__A silly pile-up of exaggerated action cliches-and much of the time, it's pretty fun.
This novel premise quickly gives way to lots of chaotic action, though there are numerous incidental pleasures throughout.__It's no fun. Everyone takes this way too seriously.__What the film doesn't have is a sense of humor.__The special effects are pretty good and the fight scenes are adequate. But the film loses steam in the fourth act ...__Stitches up Aaron Eckhart's chiseled face like a baseball cover, sticks him in a hoodie, and promptly crashes, thanks to a complete inability to resist awful, overdone dialogue and faux-lofty exposition.__If the film is made with the understanding that campiness needs to be straight-faced to be funny, then are its "unintentional" laughs really that unintentional?__There are some clean, comic-book compositions and neat architectural interlacing, but the blinkered screenplay and indifferent performances fail to lift the eschatology and self-searching off the page.__Eckhart plays Frankenstein's monster in a monotonous, teeth-gritting mode, as if someone had one gun on him and another on his family.__Yvonne Strahovski makes for one of the least believable big screen scientists since Denise Richards' infamous turn as Dr. Christmas Jones.__Incoherent, ugly and lacking in any kind of flash or dazzle.__Mainly notable for the fact that its titular character, as played by Aaron Eckhart, is really, really ripped. If People magazine had existed in the 19th century, he surely would have been feted as the sexiest undead man alive.__It doesn't come close to working, but it's sweet that they tried.__The real man-made monster in I, Frankenstein is the film itself, a ridiculous good-versus-evil story enrobed in a pastiche of religious symbolism and stodgy mythology and set in a world created in a computer special effects lab.__Long on talk and incoherent action, devoid of humor, this listless supernatural actioner surely has Mary Shelley turning in her grave.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Essentially a Monday Night Raw episode with mythological dressing.__The dialogue isn't dubbed, but is written and delivered so indifferently that it might as well have been.__[Other "Hercules" movies] at least nodded at classical mythology. Harlin's boasts a Hercules in name chiefly and banks on moviegoers' ignorance.__It delivers what it promises, which is muscular guys in skimpy clothes fighting and howling, as well as some large-scale digitally enhanced battle sequences.__The Legend of Hercules may not track, but Harlin still knows how to set up a rousing circus.__The whole thing is a total bore.__You could ask for more -- an actual script, maybe? -- but Harlin covers most of the basics. Or, perhaps more accurately, he leaves them uncovered.__The only thing epic about The Legend of Hercules is what a failure it is.__It's amazing to think there were grown-ups behind the making of The Legend of Hercules.__Cross-pollinated by sword-and-sandal flicks 300 and Gladiator,this Hercules can't muster the visual punch of the first nor the character depth of the latter.__This painfully feeble version of the strongman story fails on every level, from Lutz's wooden acting to the styrofoam special effects.__Everybody seems to have been cast based on their ability to either stare blankly, or to scream, often at the heavens.__There's nothing mythic about this Hercules.__While the role may not call for a master thespian, it at least begs someone who can emote without looking like he's straining to execute a dead lift.__If The Legend of Hercules were just a little more inept or over-the-top, it might have been ridiculous fun. ...Unfortunately, Harlin embraces the mediocrity of the screenplay with a dour straight face, draining it of any enjoyably camp possibilities.__None__None__None__None__None
Sincere and unexpectedly good, the film happily reintroduces another element of classic kids' movies: a tidy 77-minute run time.__"Bears" could have used a lot more science; more substantive information in the place of wacky one-liners. Still, the images trump everything.__Bonus points for all but eliminating the easy scatological humor. Does a bear (poop) in the woods? You won't find out watching "Bears."__There are grittier nature documentaries out there, but "Bears" is simple and effective, and delivered with that friendly Disney touch. Its intent is to make you say, "awww," and it does its job well.__All this is heartwarming, in a bloody, ursine-centric way.__Despite the bracing beauty of the wilderness, and the respite provided by cubs at play, the movie is primarily a sobering treatise on survival.__The "nature" aspects of Bears are undercut by the need to turn this into a live-action Disney cartoon, complete with cuddly heroes and nasty villains.__If the sight of bear cubs prancing through wildflowers doesn't make you smile, then you probably won't like the new Disneynature documentary Bears. You also probably aren't human.__The movie reduces magnificent, savage animals to the dimensions of a squabbling but loyal human family.__As with all of Disneynature's features, there's astonishing documentary work on display in "Bears" - but a leaner, less conspicuously structured view of the wild might have had even greater impact.__An enjoyable and visually stunning romp through the scenic Alaskan wilderness with a small family of bears.__As with Fothergill's previous nature documentaries, "Bears" is a story of triumph and family.__The astounding footage of a mother bear and two cubs fishing, fighting and hanging tough through a challenging year of foraging transcends the folksy narration.__Amid its heaping serving of cuddliness ... the film doesn't sugarcoat the harsh reality and unforgiving elements with which the bears have to contend.__The Disneynature movies shouldn't be mistaken for traditional documentary, but if they act as a gateway drug for young children to learn more about the animal kingdom, then the films are serving a real purpose.__A formulaically entertaining combination of gorgeous cinematography and unapologetic anthropomorphization.__Don't look for Disneynature's "Salmon" anytime soon.__Although Bears doesn't have a stated green message, it's hard to see the majestic natural beauty presented onscreen and not feel stewardship urges.__There's only so much editing can do to make a bear story seem like a human one, and the filmmakers (Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey directed) also go to unfortunate lengths to give human characteristics like laziness to the bears.__It may be rated G, but for the most part this is serious stuff, as potentially traumatic for younger viewers as the death of Bambi's mother.
Woodruff's direction is smooth enough on a technical level, but the film's storytelling has little dimension, even for a melodrama.__The actors are uniformly handsome and mostly serviceable, though the same can't be said about the filmmaking or the writing.__Watching "Addicted" is like eating Cheese Whiz straight from the jar. There's no nutritional value. It's kind of embarrassing. But it does satisfy a base craving for cheap, immediate sensation.__The film unfortunately depicts black female sexuality, a topic rarely portrayed onscreen, with all the depth and subtlety of a late night Cinemax offering.__"Addicted" doesn't know whether it wants to be a modern-day bodice-ripper, a morality-tinged cautionary tale or a serious snapshot of sexual compulsion. Whatever the case, it fails on all fronts.__Billed as an erotic thriller but playing more like an R-rated daytime soap, "Addicted" marks a rare but dramatically neutered opportunity to explore a black woman's sexuality onscreen.__"Addicted" doesn't fail because it wants to provide steamy, soapy melodrama to a mainstream audience; its faults are a function of its judgment, not of its genre ... more Cinemax than cinematic.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Though he's not for all tastes, there's something admirable about Wayans's willingness to do anything for a laugh, often reminiscent of Jerry Lewis at his most frantic.__A Haunted House 2 is not a movie. It is a nervous breakdown.__Run in fright.__Marlon Wayans' parody sequel is as inept and puerile as its predecessor, but let no one say its screenwriter and star doesn't give it his all.__Calling this one an improvement is like saying that being kicked in the shin is better than being punched in the stomach. Either way, it hurts.__From Honey Boo Boo to the Kardashians, from Chris Brown to Paula Deen, from Angry Birds to "Hoarders," it spares nothing and no one.__"A Haunted House 2" is so bombastically stupid that its well-earned R rating doesn't seem sufficient. The movie should come with another warning: The following 87 minutes would be better spent alphabetizing your spice rack.__You don't walk into a movie like A Haunted House 2 expecting anything remotely scary or serious, but you don't expect to walk out feeling a terrible sense of dread, either.__Wayans' performance again relies primarily on mugging it up and outrageous attempts at self-indulgent humor to elicit laughs, topped with copious doses of raunchy sexual innuendo and activity.__There are almost no redeeming qualities to this movie. It is bad enough to trigger an existential crisis in the heartiest of movie-lovers.__Though even the most accomplished improvisers occasionally rely on shtick, Wayans simply recycles the same gags; his "improv" is all shtick, with little riffing and no sense of flow.__This send-up of current horror movies is a go-for-broke hoot, a hot mess of a comedy that doesn't have a lick of sense. And knowing that going in adds to the often knee-slapping laughs.__A Haunted House 2 is dumber than dumb dumb, which at least has the nerve to be unapologetically dumb. Worse, it's Wayans dumb.__A movie for morons that is offensive on so many levels. It is loud, profane and profoundly stupid. One has to question how a film so awful could even be made, it is that bad. Most regrettably, it is not funny, not even a tiny bit.__Unapologetically stupid. Proudly stupid. Aggressively stupid.__None__None__None__None__None
Hoffman's an actor who could do just about anything, but being authentically German is not one of them.__One of the countless sad things about losing Hoffman is the realization that we'll never get to watch him single-handedly elevate an otherwise OK movie again.__It was shot in dark, lurid, vital Hamburg; Hoffman is the star; and I was completely held.__Given the deadly stakes, this should be gripping, but the film gets sucked into academic plot details, trudging through each rendezvous and stakeout.__The puzzle-like premise of A Most Wanted Man is a fabrication, but you cannot escape the fascination of Hoffman waiting for despair to be confirmed.__[Hoffman] scales his performance to Olympian heights, yet he elevates all his collaborators, too.__Hoffman, bloated and flushed, does not look well in this film. But he is such a consummate actor that whatever infirmities he may have been fighting become a part of his performance.__With his sharp instincts and exhausted wisdom, the character of Gunther offers us a bittersweet reminder of Hoffman's gifts in what is his last completed film.__"One of the best spy thrillers in recent years."__A Most Wanted Man doesn't snap into focus until the last 15 of its 121 minutes. But until then, director Anton Corbijn serves up plenty of good, foggy, rainy ambiguity.__It's hard not to want A Most Wanted Man to go on forever, if only to spend time in the company of Hoffman - one of the great actors of his, or any, generation.__The story unfolds slowly, with the filmmaker's own fascination with process at center stage.__Hoffman brings a balance of fierce obsession and weary resignation to the role, and ends on a howling note that's so deeply human it brings shivers.__To spy, to lie, to seduce, to deceive, to try to do right, to destroy - that is the current that runs under everything in le Carre's fiction, and it courses through Hoffman's veins as Bachmann in A Most Wanted Man.__[A] crackerjack thriller, at once brooding, claustrophobic and unbearably tense ...__A movie that tries to cover many facets of the post-9/11 period, though it doesn't quite make up for the fact that a great cast is sometimes wasted.__A rather sad movie about the potential futility of doing good, or at least taking the difficult path, in a complicated world.__Most Wanted can often be a chilly bit of business, but it's no less gripping for its emotional distance, thanks mostly to a superb cast led by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.__A Most Wanted Man retains a cogent narrative and le Carre's weary outlook. Rather than choke the narrative with details, the filmmakers keep the story lean while adding evocative visual and aural details.__"A Most Wanted Man" is not a guns-and-motorcycles spy story but a shadowy walk down a dark alley.
The trouble with this movie -- aside from its lack of visual wonder and musical shape -- is that you don't trust its priorities.__Another sappy but engaging musical fable from the Irish writer and director John Carney, who made "Once."__The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.__Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.__Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.__You can't really blame writer-director John Carney for trying, but despite a few very nice moments, this bigger, slicker follow-up mostly argues that Once should have been enough.__Its soft-rock bonhomie [prevails] over a story that often registers as trite or naive.__The movie is moderately obsessed with the ideal of authenticity, which is a rather awkward position to champion given that it is a calculatedly more-commercial, less-authentic variation of a film, Once, that Carney had already made.__The cast is, to a person, so likable and chummy that you want everyone to succeed. And the songs are hook-laden, easygoing numbers that are genuinely enjoyable.__Doggedly indie but unpretentious, "Begin Again" is one of the best movies I've seen about the music industry and the ways it changes people whose paths diverge.__Begin Again is corny, improbable and generally a great deal of fun.__"Begin Again" sets out to be a feel-good movie and, despite such obvious intentions, it thoroughly succeeds.__Can a song save your life? And can an impossibly mushy, mawkish movie make you feel good? The answer to the second question, anyway, is yes.__"Begin Again" may not always swing, but it makes up for that in sincerity and a welcome willingness to ambush expectations.__"Begin Again" is pleasantly predictable if you're in an undemanding mood. If you're not, it's unbearable, like hearing a treasured folk song given a Hot 97 makeover.__Carney is on to something in "Begin Again," some handle on a particular truth he's exploring, and he remains faithful to it through the finish.__Carney deserves great credit for the movie's clever, layered structure, and for resisting a few obvious plot turns along the way. Lightning doesn't strike, but sunshine works, too.__Knightley brings emotional confusion into sharp, touching focus as the pair bond over nighttime strolls and the shared love of classic pop. Carney flips film cliches to keep us guessing.__"Begin Again" is an ode to the indie-rock spirit, but its music -- written by Carney and others -- is as safe, smooth and Starbucks-friendly as Norah Jones.__"Begin Again" feels more like a glorified retread of "Once" than something freshly imagined.
The movie's found-footage conceit never creates a proper atmosphere, something essential to any horror film but particularly one involving the occult.__Throw in an abandoned house in the neighborhood that is suddenly occupied, a vanishing obstetrician and a first communion ceremony that goes terribly wrong, and the chill factor quickly rises.__A disjointed and unconvincing movie that is also embarrassingly derivative of "Paranormal Activity."__Dredging up horror movie favorites like random nosebleeds, a traumatized priest and a mama-to-be with a yen for raw meat, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett direct with competence but a dispiriting lack of originality.__At least there's a credible premise in "Devil's Due," an otherwise feeble exercise in the found-footage form.__The feature-length debut of two thirds of the directorial troupe Radio Silence scrambles to find any excuse to cut to a new angle or shoot traditional coverage while debasing a potentially compelling story with every found-footage cliche in the book.__Devlin's script tips its hand so early on that Devil's Due lumbers toward a woefully flat, predictable ending, and the unwelcome promise of something truly demonic - sequels.__Offers precious little in the way of real scares or engaging characters, and even less in original ideas.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Everything about the movie is as uninspired as the title.__[A] depressingly monotonous Rob Reiner-directed comedy starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton.__And So It Goes may touch the frayed heartstrings of some older viewers, but it's pretty bad - the failed attempt to Heimlich a venerable movie genre.__And So It Goes never goes quite far enough, in any direction.__This film is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food.__As generic as its title.__We get little flashes of story beats, but then it's on to the next thing - never enough to make us really invested in what's happening to these people.__Thirty years to the week after "When Harry Met Sally,'' Rob Reiner directs the excruciating, mawkish and interminable romantic dramedy "And So It Goes'' with shocking ineptitude.__The script is a series of familiar tropes.__"And So It Goes" does what it needs to do for its target audience in thoroughly sufficient, mediocre ways.__Adequate perhaps for a matinee on a dull weekday - but only if the senior discount applies.__None of this is remotely funny. It's actually kind of sad.__If director Rob Reiner's AARP-aimed comedy stumbles on several fronts, at least it provides a stage for some seasoned pros to strut their stuff.__A movie as generic as its title, And So It Goes is about a cranky old man who gets to know and help a child in need and becomes a happier, better person. Yes, I know. I gagged a little when I wrote that, too.__Pure schmaltz masquerading as life wisdom, it pairs Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton for no apparent reason other than that they fit the elder baby boomer cohort the film is squarely aimed at.__In a different movie with a better script, Douglas and Keaton might have been charming together, with his dryness balancing her feathery ramblings.__Relatable doesn't have to mean routine, but Mr. Reiner doesn't always bother to tell the difference ...__The pieces of this would-be feel-good movie sink into place with a depressing thud.__A little too corny to endorse fully, but no one should be discouraged from seeing it.__Even with these star wattage pros, Rob Reiner's senior citizen romantic comedy is about as engaging as a drooling nap on a porch.
In every scene here, Prince-Bythewood calmly and sensitively melts our resistance to the outlandish, outsized quality of her plot and stays true to the message she wants to deliver without ever getting pious or preachy.__Has the elements of a classic backstage story, but they don't quite crystallize into an integral drama.__It's a movie about a rising superstar that features two of them-Mbatha-Raw and Parker, both enormously appealing, impossibly attractive performers with big futures ahead of them.__"Beyond the Lights" is a faint shadow of 1992's "The Bodyguard," without the star power of Whitney Houston or Kevin Costner.__Director Prince-Bythewood, who made the move from television to the big-screen in 2000 with the terrific romance Love and Basketball has a way with actors.__How bracing today to have a film that's at once fun, patient, romantic, and real.__Prince-Bythewood is stingingly astute at what fame does to objectify women. And Gugu Mbatha-Raw, so good this year in Belle, is a shining new star.__If it were any cheesier, they could pour it on macaroni.__A formulaic, often melodramatic crowd-pleaser with thoughts on celebrity-driven culture and the ravenous appetite of fans, followers and the media.__"Beyond the Lights" doesn't have much insight into the world of modern celebrity, but as a romance, its actors make it sing.__Along the way, Mbatha-Raw looks, sounds and moves like an A-lister. If "Belle" put the actress on Hollywood's radar, "Beyond the Lights" heralds her superstardom.__While melodramatic in the vein of A Star Is Born, Beyond the Lights is also a wise and open-hearted look at the price of fame upon personal identity.__The movie has a soapy impulse that it would have done well to resist, given the occasional surprising strength of its more unvarnished elements.__Silly and stirring, and I meant both as compliments.__You're drawn to her, and you root for her; there's something in Mbatha-Raw's lovely, direct gaze that pulls us in.__Mbatha-Raw is clearly destined for bigger things. Consider Beyond the Lights a stop along the way.__The fact that "Beyond the Lights" is so effective at both celebrating and critiquing extravagance and artifice can be credited to Prince-Bythewood's shrewd understanding of the highly pitched cinematic vernacular she's working with.__Over the course of the film, Mbatha-Raw does many things, all of them quite well.__The film soldiers on through a couple of possible endings, and if its real destination is never truly in doubt, Mbatha-Raw makes the trip interesting.__This unusually intelligent crowd-pleaser is welcome proof that quality filmmaking needn't be limited by subject, audience or budget.
A feminist psycho-melodrama made without insight or dramatic excitement.__Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz are charismatic in the lead roles; occasionally they distract from the movie's overall smugness.__For all its tonal shifts and erratic pacing, the film is Burton's heartfelt tribute to the yearning that drives even the most marginalized artist to self expression no matter what the hell anyone thinks.__Burton might need to get further from blockbuster bloat in order to regain his formal mastery of kitsch. Right now his sense of comic portraiture is too easily mistakable for splatter painting.__Adams is lovely and tremulous, but Big Eyes would be even better if Waltz was in the same key.__Waltz ham-and-eggs Adams off the screen. In the process, the movie strands her character without an inner life, a psychology, or anything that would indicate what makes her tick.__The story is just so downright weird that the film can't help but be compelling. Just not as compelling as it could have been.__I watched wide-eyed with dismay while the film turned as lifeless as the paintings.__A wondrously strange true story about art and heartbreak, intellectual property theft, and the subjugation of women.__In "Big Eyes," the sincerity of the artist trumps the judgment of the critics, and her vision triumphs over fraudulent promotion. It makes a passionate case for her. Whether it vindicates her art is another question entirely.__You can't help but sense Tim Burton nodding in agreement when Walter bellows, "Just because people like my work, does that make it bad?"__Throughout his career, Burton has always been capable of surprising audiences. "Big Eyes" is no exception.__Adams is very good at the difficult art of making passive characters interesting -- a gift that stands her in good stead here.__Nimble, off the beaten track and very entertaining, it's the cinematic equivalent of a lava lamp.__Burton lets his film putter along in middle gear, provoking neither riotous laughter nor emotional immersion.__This portrait of a woman on the verge - of success, of suppression, of submission, of rebellion - is never fully realized.__What matters is, does the artist speak through this work? And does this work speak to you? And "Big Eyes" does. I just wish it spoke louder.__Visually inventive, as are all of Burton's movies, "Big Eyes" is pleasant enough to watch; you just wish there were more to it.__A smart, funny, feel-good film -- from Tim Burton? It's his best since "Ed Wood."__"Big Eyes" toys with some amusing ideas, and that's enough.
A shoo-in to clean up at the next Razzie Awards.__Not only is this an amateurish travesty combining fundamentalist Christian eschatology with disaster movie b.s., but it's plodding and tedious.__It should have more smoldering panic bursting into full-blown freak-outs. It should have more passion, more intensity. It should have more bees.__Left Behind is biblical in its silliness.__It believes people might buy a ticket to Left Behind and not know the twist, like someone sitting down to watch Godzilla and being shocked by the entrance of a giant lizard.__Score one for Satan.__Featuring local-cable production values and dialogue that seems written by a crack team of Sunday schoolers, director Vic Armstrong's "Left Behind" does no favors for the Christian proponents of its belief system ...__Forced to wait at least half an hour for the skeletal plot to kick in, we have plenty of time to notice the awkward dialogue and slapdash logic.__American Idol champ Jordin Sparks .. sings the end-credits ditty, "I Wish We'd All Been Ready." Viewers will wish that director Vic Armstrong and scripters Paul Lalonde and John Patus had been ready, too.__Left Behind seriously could have used some divine intervention.__Fans of the evangelical-Christian film genre ... should demand higher production values instead of blindly supporting a movie just because they appreciate its themes.__At best, Left Behind is shoddily made sensationalist propaganda-with atrocious acting-that barely registers as entertainment. At worst, it's profoundly moronic.__"Left Behind" is a terrible movie, bad in almost every way, not even qualifying as so-bad-it's-good material.__The Rapture won't come soon enough for the unfortunate souls forced to suffer through Left Behind.__With a Sharknado-inspired visual style and a deeply weary lead performance from Nicolas Cage, Left Behind is cheap-looking, overwrought kitsch of the most unintentionally hilarious order.__With so much emphasis on proselytizing, there's little energy remaining for, you know, characters, plotting, dialogue ... pacing ...__"Left Behind" takes the end of the world and turns it not into a nightmare, but a nice long nap.__Cage is going for manly, if conflicted, family-guy confidence in this role, but somehow it comes off as nuttier than the events surrounding him.__This Left Behind may be worse than the last Left Behind, but it's much less boring, thanks in part to the commitment of its star, who plays the often ludicrous material with the straightest of faces. The Cage works in mysterious ways.__What has gone so horribly wrong in Cage's career that he is forced to accept any paycheck that comes his way?
Reviewers were forbidden from posting a word about this sequel until opening day, lest we give away the shocking secret that it's a carbon copy of its predecessor.__There are a handful of ways in which A Dame to Kill For actually improves on the first movie. Alas, none are enough to prevent it from being a substantial disappointment.__A Dame To Kill For isn't likely to create converts out of those uninterested in the pulpy side of fiction. But it more than earns its keep in terms of lavishing love, mildly ironic as well as pretty damn earnest, on pumped-up noir.__Miller's original comic-book frames serve narrative functions, but these movies are all grabby graphics, devoid of compelling style.__You don't expect to be exhausted by reams of soul-sick narration and artful chiaroscuro compositions, but that's what happens.__For those who appreciated Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's 2005 campy, kinetic film noir homage, Sin City, the 2014 follow-up, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is unlikely to disappoint.__It's hard to believe that so much visual elegance has been brought to bear on material so ugly, and yet the disjunction is intentional, and the film is all of a piece.__If you showed the Sin City midnight world in smaller doses, as a weekly series on late-night cable television, the slick graphics and cold kink might be more compelling.__The movie winds up folding under the weight of its own heavy tone, itself another victim of the darkness and nihilism of Sin City.__Why sit through this pimply excuse for pulp fiction? Why not read the real boys (Goodis, Cain, Thompson), or see the real films (Forget it, Jake. It's not Chinatown)?__Anyone offended by graphic violence, kinky sex and eyefuls of nudity should stay away. But for those who like their fiction hard-boiled like a rock and naughty to the bone, expect to be pleased, if not thoroughly satisfied.__The movie's all just broads and mugs and gats and gore.__In a Hollywood landscape where so much action cinema in plagued with sameness, I can not in good conscience give anything with this level of inspired design an entirely negative review.__The greatest sin of "Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame To Kill For" is the way its high style is brought low -- visually stunning, but emotionally vapid, unrelentingly violent, its splendiferous comic book cast mostly squandered.__This is one badass movie.__If only the characters didn't have to talk.__Punishingly stylized, this marriage of comic-book panels and hard-boiled dialogue has a heaviness that can't be explained solely by its cynicism or lack of wit. It's a blunt instrument whose visual shadings far surpass the kill-or-be-killed storytelling.__It's a town of bad women and worse poets, where the fists are hard, the talk is tough but nothing is for real - and nothing doesn't add up to much.__As usual with "Sin City," much of the vibe is about echoing genre touchstones, while the look isn't quite like anything else the digital age has seen.__The movie's trademark mix of live action and drawing techniques (white silhouettes, reddened lips, an abundance of venetian blinds) looks fantastic. If it's depth you want, you've knocked on the wrong door.
If you have even the tiniest cynical bone in your body, avoid. You'll find Labor Day more sugary than a cronut.__Jason Reitman forgot the tapioca.__"Labor" isn't just a word in the title of Jason Reitman's new film, it's a description of what it feels like to sit through the movie.__The story unfolds with an earnestness so implacable that on the rare occasions when a bit of humor sneaks into the proceedings it feels like an uninvited party guest.__Engagingly sappy.__Nothing against Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin and director Jason Reitman - top talents all - but my goodwill drowned while trying to swallow this treacly cocktail of romantic swill.__Mush [that] comes with an unappetizing side order of condescension and contempt.__It's so terrible it's amazing.__Labor Day is the sort of movie where the characters are all extremely watchful: They shoot worried glances at each other but don't demonstrate much good sense.__It's hard to tell what Reitman-who also wrote the script, based on the novel by Joyce Maynard-intended here.__It is a yarn. But it's so full of passion, poetry, and humor that it becomes, for the time, quite real.__While "Labor Day" isn't the stuff of blockbusters, or Oscar juggernauts, it is a simple, adult romance, made for grownups by grownups, about love and second chances.__This hostage drama swiftly degenerates into a gauzy wish fulfillment about two outsiders finding each other in a love that must overcome boundaries, separation and time.__Suddenly Labor Day is not a movie but a Harlequin book cover, and Frank is a felonious Fabio.__In compressing Maynard's deeply internal book into the necessarily visual film format, Reitman strips the story of nearly all of the book's barely repressed sexual heat, and hence most of its impact.__"Labor Day" seems designed for the crowd that devours Nicholas Sparks's romantic daydreams.__Labor Day feels like a belabored, sappy slog.__It's difficult to believe a word of "Labor Day," but then again you don't have to in order to luxuriate in Winslet and Brolin's bubbling, steaming chemistry.__The kind of movie that turns clarity into stultification; everything is perfectly clear and almost everything-pie-making excepted-is perfectly lifeless.__The movie's a very somber affair, but if you see it in a disrespectful frame of mind, it's the guilty-pleasure hoot of the season.
The movie swings - physically, musically, psychologically, racially.__It would be an insult to call Chazelle a "promising" filmmaker, as this movie doesn't indicate mere potential - it is evidence of authentic, sometimes blazing talent.__Such a cooked-up piece of claptrap that I half expected Darth Vader to pick up the baton.__'Whiplash' is electric from beginning to end, a musical story of obsession, frustration and outright cruelty built on two knockout performances.__Director Damien Chazelle, who based the story on his own experience as a student jazz drummer in the thrall of an Alpha task-master, has created a remarkably economical and claustrophobic piece of storytelling.__Primarily two actors and a jazz score, but the result is a crackling good drama that feels almost like a thriller. Smart, stylish and intense.__The film works, often wonderfully, as a remarkable visualization of jazz music - you feel it and breathe it, just like the musicians - and as a showcase for the two actors at its center.__Ultimately, "Whiplash" isn't just about jazz - and it's not necessary to be a fan of the music to enjoy the film - but about life.__The film's true subject is innate talent - for music, writing, painting, sculpture, plumbing, whatever - and the superhuman lengths we sometimes have to go to in order to wring it out of ourselves.__At times, it evidences the qualities of a can't-turn-away car wreck: brutal and horrific yet compelling. At other times, it has the rhythms of a sports drama with all the ups and downs inherent in that genre.__An intense, unmelodious, highly amped and probably unrealistic drama set in the fictionalized Schaefer Conservatory in New York.__Quite simply, Whiplash is one of the year's best films.__It's as much a horror movie as it is a keenly realized indie about jazz, about art, about what it takes to claim greatness.__[Simmons gives] a crisp and nasty performance. The bullied submit, eyes cast down, relieved when they're not the target of his hectoring. His insults are torn from the misogynistic, homophobic playbook.__Whiplash darts along at an urgent bebop pace and asks questions applicable to most fields: How much are you willing to endure for the chance to be great? And what if cruelty isn't a better motivator than kindness?__Oh, yes. It's that good.__Whiplash is, at best, heightened realism. There's no way that Fletcher could have gotten away with his teaching methods without serious legal - or physical - pushback long before Andrew comes along. But, as drama, it's a crackling good time.__A bruising, anger-scarred music academy drama not to be missed.__Simmons is always good. Here, he is great. His brilliant performance is, if not the single best of the year, certainly among them.__At its best, "Whiplash" conveys with pungent detail the striving of young people eager to make their bones in a Manhattan that's as foul and forbidding as it is seductive.
On a purely narrative level, Winter's Tale missteps early and often. Its earnestness is its downfall, resulting in opportunities for unintentional humor.__We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 10 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy.__It's so filled with high-flown blather about love, destiny and miracles that there's no room for enchantment.__If only there was less mush and more meat in this stew.__Winter's Tale is preposterous twaddle. Use it as a date movie only if you don't love the one you're with.__It might all make more sense to fans of the book. But you shouldn't have to have read the book to be able to see and enjoy the movie.__You have to stretch your imagination just a teensy bit - OK, a whale of a lot - to buy into it.__Winter's Tale is the kind of really bad movie that may still be quite easy to like, or even love, if you abandon all senses ye who enter here.__Not only is the story of magic, angels, demons and predetermined destiny preposterous, but the characters are also unconvincing and the dialogue sanctimonious.__Because it is fearlessly sincere and not totally successful, "Winter's Tale" is easy to mock. But it is also hard not to admire its willingness to go all out in its quest for the grandest of romantic gestures.__Clumsy and inert, a lumbering white elephant rather than the flying white horse that is the novel's magical mascot.__Enduring this soppy muddle of twinkling stars, fluttering wings, refracted points of light and destiny-led swooners is like being forced to listen at length to a crazy person at a street corner read out old Hallmark greeting cards.__Like the frozen expanses of its most dramatic settings, "Winter's Tale" is mostly hard, glittering surface.__How do you adapt "Winter's Tale," Mark Helprin's epic 1983 magical-realist novel, into a movie? If you're writer-director Akiva Goldsman, you take a meat tenderizer and hammer away until all that's left is romantic-fantasy mush.__A surrealist love story with countless admirers has been reduced by Akiva Goldsman's screen version to a potboiler brimming with treacly preachments.__"Winter's Tale" is ambitious with its otherworldly ingredients and temporal leaps. It's not always a success, but the movie has one thing going for it: spot-on casting.__This live-action fairy tale aims to recapture the romantic splendor MGM's golden era; the dialogue and metaphysical conceits are often risible, but even they convey an emotionalism rare in 21st-century Hollywood.__Goldsman has stripped the source material for parts and for its through-line, eliminating various characters, as is the case with any adaptation. What's left is sincere ridiculousness.__"Winter's Tale" has a magic white horse, and these days you just can't see enough of those.__It's a pretty film full of magic and miracles - a flying horse, a child saved, a man made immortal by love, a mortal character who by my count is at least 104 years old but still working as a newspaper editor - but, alas, it just doesn't gel.
[Miller] is equally adept at portraying the peculiarities of wrestling here, and how those physical moves -- beautifully choreographed and executed -- sync with deeper psychological currents.__There's just no life in the film: aiming for a tone of studied foreboding, Bennett Miller instead sucks all the energy from his story.__Director Bennett Miller ("Capote," "Moneyball") has a fascinating story here and he knows it.__Watch this film for the performances: Tatum and Ruffalo finding new ground in familiar personas; Carell immersing himself into the mindset of a troubled man ...__Foxcatcher is too cold of a movie to love, but that chilliness is intentional and transfixing, a parable about the darkest corners of the minds of damaged men that dares to whisper instead of shout.__If you're willing to be thrown for a loop, you're in good hands with this medal-worthy cast and crew.__Carell is immersed in the role, completely convincing. Tatum also is outstanding.__The triumph of Foxcatcher is not in the subject but in its art. The clear-eyed compassion and moral intelligence of Miller's film brings sense to the senseless, and finds the human pulse behind the tabloid shock.__What Miller and his team have wrought with Foxcatcher is a spellbinding portrait of desire and loneliness, which so often manifests itself in hollow victories and violent acts.__You want to know where it's headed. But the movie is so chiseled down and sculpted that even once it gets there (you know when), it's unclear that it's earned it.__We expect expert acting from Ruffalo, and we get it, but the secret hero of "Foxcatcher" - and the performance you keep coming back to - is Channing Tatum as Mark, a lost boy in the skin of a brute.__The year's best cast, including a phenomenal Carell, makes up for slow pacing in the latest drama from the director of "Capote."__It's too bad then that the film...doesn't live up to Carell's memorable performance. As chilly as du Pont's mansion on a winter's night, Foxcatcher never quite comes together.__"Foxcatcher" is a warped, oppressive landmark.__Even if you don't know the details of this real-life, late-20th-century tragedy, director Bennett Miller's masterfully observed psychological study is imbued with a sense of an inevitable, catastrophic meltdown.__The fatherhood issues fueling the tension among Mark (Channing Tatum), Dave (Mark Ruffalo), and du Pont (a creepy, completely unrecognizable Steve Carell) are muted but powerfully realized.__The story here may have been worth a movie, but it's so diluted over a long and repetitive 134 minutes that's it's really hard to tell.__At its core, "Foxcatcher" grapples, bluntly, with the subjects of class and money, and what some people do when, to quote a line from "Psycho," they can't buy off their own unhappiness.__Pretty-boy Tatum impresses in every way. While it might not be a stretch for the strapping actor to play an athlete, it is a revelation to see how much he physically transforms into the hulking wrestler ...__Foxcatcher isn't afraid of venturing into territory avoided by most sports-related motion pictures. This isn't an inspirational film; in fact, quite the opposite is true.
A good-looking and exceedingly polite film where perhaps a more complex one with less good manners would have been better.__It's an old-fashioned movie with a very modern streak, centered by a vibrant star turn by Mbatha-Raw, whose watchful, wise Dido makes an enchanting heroine.__Charming and stirring.__Luminous British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw brings a hope and intelligent hunger to Dido. She's loved by her family enough to have a sense of belonging but hemmed in by broader cultural realities to experience moments of unease.__The film simply looks lovely, never moreso than when Mbatha-Raw is on screen.__Belle presents an interesting history lesson, one that had significant repercussions, but some of the developments in this storyline turn out to be woefully convenient.__With stately surroundings and hissable villains, director Amma Assante imbues the finale with such dramatic resonance that "Belle" becomes a ringing proclamation of human dignity.__There's the occasional false note. The proto-abolitionist Davinier has been given dialogue that verges on the preachy. But this is a small quibble in a story of 250-year-old pride and prejudice that resonates today.__Brings these themes to a dramatic head: romance and race, privilege and justice.__[The movie] is so determined to be moral and good and optimistically anti-tragic that it forgets to be interesting, original, and illuminating.__Powerful stuff, for sure. Yet, when Asante finally closes with a close-up of Belle's portrait, there's something in her eyes and her smile that suggests so much more.__A lavish 18th-century historical piece that blends a Jane Austen-like romance with a political drama that explores slavery from a unique perspective.__A slice of Masterpiece Theatre cheese in which a biracial heiress makes her way through 18th-century English society while her guardian tries an insurance fraud case involving a slave ship.__One occasionally wishes Asante had chosen a more rigorous course of action with her period piece, but she perhaps also knows that sugar is more seductive than sermons.__"Belle" has the pace and sumptuous cinematography of a Merchant and Ivory production, but none of their memorable characters, subtle performances, or literate dialogue.__The movie packs a lot in, and the quick pace of early scenes can feel like running on a treadmill, but "Belle" settles into a nice rhythm.__This British historical drama is getting the "inspiring true story" treatment, though the inspiring parts aren't true and the true parts aren't inspiring.__"Belle" is a beautiful period piece, but it's also something more: a study of racism, classism and sexism in 18th-century England.__Its best performers find their truths and telling details in between the straightforward expository lines.__It's smartly acted, handsome, and well-crafted in a way that'll make it irresistible to the Merchant-Ivory/Masterpiece Theater set - think pride, with a whole lot of prejudice.
As a vehicle for those two actors, The Drop is gangbusters.__It's a classic case of a little becoming a lot onscreen on the basis of a single impressive performance.__You have to sit through the slow parts to savor the cool parts. The movie's little surprise is that you didn't waste your time watching it; you were just being primed for an explosion of low volume and high impact.__This is a movie you stumble across when hunting for something to watch: goodish, with the right dreary atmosphere.__The Drop's unpredictability is organic rather than sensationalistic. The movie doesn't pull surprises out of thin air for the sole purpose of shocking an audience - it lets them develop naturally.__Not that it needed demonstrating, but Hardy once again shows what quiet force and phenomenal range he has. He's like a young Liam Neeson with Michael Fassbender chops.__Lehane's climactic plot twist is all the more laudable because it springs directly from complexity of character; you realize the truth has been obscured not through a writer's trickery but through your own simple reading of the action.__It's a slow-cooking set-up for a startling climax. One, thanks to fine acting, that comes with powerful revelations.__I found this dark odyssey through an amoral dream Brooklyn curiously invigorating; it's a masterful construction that held me rapt from first shot to last, that builds intense electrical energy and then releases it.__With the arrival of The Drop, a disturbingly dark little thriller that wears its tension like a badge, the fall film season has arrived with a deadly bang.__Roskam treats the material with reverence, and the working-class Brooklyn setting with a painterly eye.__In the end, this tale of lonely souls and soulless thugs - of money and morality - even feels kind of hopeful.__Rapace somehow layers on a New York accent, Hardy brings his sweet, slow fuse and Gandolfini ... well, he makes you ache for more.__The Drop is steeped in a simmering underworld familiar to fans of late directors Sidney Lumet and Arthur Penn, and stripped of primary colours like their '70s cinema classics.__James Gandolfini's final film role: quietly magnificent work.__While "The Drop" has an enviable feeling for the dark end of the street, the kind of across-the-board success it's seeking remains just out of reach.__Less than top-drawer Lehane but well worth watching all the same.__Fine performances, including Gandolfini's last, help compensate for a patchwork plot by first-time screenwriter Dennis Lehane.__In his final role, Gandolfini may be playing a mobbed-up man again, but he was too gifted an actor to repeat himself.__Like Gandolfini, the deep Brooklyn of "The Drop" is formidable, bona fide and memorable.
It's an accomplished, stately movie -- unimpassioned but pleasing.__The movie's opening hour has a fascinating balance of nonsense and depth... If only Allen could keep that introspection and frippery going.__There's a dashed-off, shorthand quality to it, as if everyone involved is going through the motions.__Largely thanks to the intoxicating scenery and the gorgeous natural-light cinematography, "Magic in the Moonlight" does weave its a spell, resurrecting the spirit of sturdier and more inventive movies by the same conjurer.__The cinematography is radiant, the vintage cars and costumes are elegant, and if the comedy feels laboured, it's all too lightweight to matter.__There are virtually no laughs to be had in this movie, though it's dressed up as a romantic comedy. It mostly resembles an overlong lecture on the power of reason and man's need for escape.__For all its visual delights, Magic in the Moonlight, the 44th feature written and directed by the admirably industrious Woody Allen, has to be one of his bigger duds.__In "Magic in the Moonlight," the debate is between rationalism and faith - what you can see with your own eyes versus what you're willing to leap into the dark for - but it's given a trite, cursory treatment.__You may have memorized jokes from Allen's other films. This one will have you quoting the scenery.__It used to be that Woody Allen's failures were more interesting than most filmmakers' successes, but his latest offering is depressing proof that this no longer the case.__Magical in theme but not effect, Woody Allen's new movie has nothing up its sleeve or on its vaguely engaged mind.__As Allen tries to fill up 97 minutes with this silly, dull bauble, you'll wish you had some magical powers of your own to make yourself disappear from the theater.__Just another unmemorable motion picture for which it's difficult to remember the broad brush strokes, not to mention the details, once the house lights have come on.__It starts off with a flourish and winds up limp, like a rabbit pulled out of a hat that turns out to be dead.__Allen hasn't lost his comic spark -- he's still in the midst of a comic revival.__Firth is effective as the insufferable Stanley, who is ripe for his comeuppance from the very first time we see him haranguing his help backstage after a performance in Berlin.__This being a Woody Allen film, there's some pretty sharp dialogue.__A movie which proceeds logically, but not always laughingly, from careful setup to dutiful complications to unsurprising denouement.__As to whether "Moonlight" is magical - it is, but ever, ever so slightly.__Can we all stop making excuses for Woody Allen now?
It's the human element in Island of Lemurs: Madagascar that disappoints.__The animated lemurs make kids laugh in Madagascar, but the real-life ones in Island of Lemurs: Madagascar should enthrall and inspire even the youngest.__The film is an equally fun and sobering look at the lives of these animals, along with the evolving efforts to try and save this distant cousin of humans.__"Island of Lemurs: Madagascar" accomplishes a great deal in its 40-minute running time, entertaining and educating us while delivering a message about preservation that's clear without being heavy-handed.__No matter which variety the film is spotlighting, they have a power to fascinate.__The technology impressively embraces the audience, putting us in the middle of the rain forest, face to face with curious, beady eyes.__Even at a meager 40 minutes, the film feels padded.__This 3-D IMAX documentary puts its best paw forward with a funny and exuberant title sequence, followed by 40 minutes of phenomenal footage of lemurs in their native habitat of Madagascar.__If you don't already love lemurs, you will after taking this brief but illuminating tour of the exotic primate's island home off the African coast.__This Morgan Freeman-narrated documentary doesn't stray much from the nature-doc formula of making its stars look frisky and winsome while sprinkling in a few info-nuggets about the critters (they're older than dinosaurs!). And that's just fine.__Part sumptuous IMAX documentary, part fervent but dull conservationist pitch, Island Of Lemurs seems destined instead for an obscurity all too familiar to nature films not released by Disneynature.__A serviceable Imax 3D nature documentary that duly meets the requirements of the form: majestic and intimate outdoor imagery, a grave yet reassuring lesson on the importance of wildlife preservation, and a short-and-sweet 40-minute running time.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
I don't know what Ayer is trying to prove by dunking the camera in spilled guts and having it linger over charred and frozen corpses.__What redeems all this, to some extent, is Ayer's bleak but honest vision... he understands how law-enforcement people witnessing the depths of humanity might lack the necessary character to climb back up.__For most of its running length, Sabotage is a gritty, compelling motion picture with twists to make a pretzel envious. Unfortunately, it overstays its welcome.__Sabotage starts off as a fun, nasty, occasionally surprising little piece of genre filmmaking. But it gradually loses the thread.__Director David Ayer has made two of the best films about the tough lives of cops -- Training Day and End of Watch -- but his streak ends with the very violent and ultimately forgettable Sabotage.__[an] ugly, abrasive and thoroughly charm-resistant bag of slop__It does have a weird, boldly ugly edge that makes for unexpectedly compelling viewing.__Horror movie-gruesome and pumped up like a 'roid rage, "Sabotage" is an abrasive, ugly exercise in macho nonsense.__This is the type of movie best enjoyed as a late-night indulgence on cable. Really late at night, when your eyes are still partially open, but your brain has called it quits.__This is the disreputable, even disgusting diversion the Expendables pictures should've been.__A modern-day, Georgia-set version of a spaghetti Western.__Rarely has a non-horror movie lavished as much attention on viscera and entrails; the only times brains enter the picture are from head wounds.__"Sabotage" isn't any good, even if its jagged, jolting visual excesses and frenzied energy keep you awake, gasping and guffawing by turns.__Bloody, banal and boasting a surprisingly able clutch of stars who will soon be deleting this from their resumes, Sabotage is a 109-minute cadaver count.__Anybody got a bar of soap? Hand it over. I've got a movie here that needs its mouth washed out.__Ayer directs with style, very little sense, and a wheelbarrow full of blood squibs.__So Arnold Schwarzenegger has reached the shaky-cam-and-hoodies stage of his career. But it's a bit late in the day for Arnold to try to get all indie and complicated.__It seems strange to say about an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but "Sabotage" is flabby.__With this bloody exercise in provocation, the aging action hero climbs aboard the crooked-cop bandwagon like it was an ambulance to revive his dying career.__The bloodshed is unrelenting and, ultimately, exhausting. There are [only] so many disembowelments and head shots, and bodies torn into pieces you can take.
If the concept of a moms' night out is premised on the notion that mothers can never get away for fear their families will collapse in their absence, then this movie cruelly confirms that fear.__What ensues is frenetic and never as funny as it should be because directing brothers Andrew and Jon Erwin are not skilled enough at pacing the action and varying the volume.__Basically, the moral of the story is: Don't go out. Because if you do, all hell will break loose - or rather, all heck.__Some of these plot twists require more than the normal suspension of logic that often happens in similar comedies. Yet the characters are all appealing.__Seldom has wackiness been as tedious as it is in "Moms' Night Out," a Christian-themed film that is desperate to make adherents seem wild and crazy but mostly makes them seem incapable of raising children.__It's rare that a movie fails on absolutely every level, but "Moms' Night Out" is a remarkably vivid example.__What this PG comedy lacks in cursing, it also comes up short on plot, character development, originality, and overall pleasure.__While the characters are mostly one-dimensional and the children here merely props, whiny and overwhelmed main mom Allyson proves a particularly galling, unfunny creation.__There's no fun to be had - and not a drop of originality - in this chaotic and contrived mess.__"Moms' Night Out" possesses the production values and awkward pacing of a lame amateur production with big ambitions.__"Moms' Night Out" is really all about moms staying home, where, according to this movie, they apparently belong.__Too-long, one-joke scenes with a flakey restaurant hostess (Anjelah Johnson) and a dim-witted clerk in a tattoo parlour (Manwell Reyes) are typical of the sins of lengthy excess committed by Mom's Night Out.__The film never seems hectoring or preachy. Unfortunately, it never seems funny either, coming across like a sanitized remake of some raunchier laughfest.__The first half of this mommy-comedy could be charitably deemed "gently amusing." But it's hard to find new laugh riots in kids trashing a house, and there's no evidence anyone tried.__Outrageously enough, the moral of Moms' Night Out seems to be that moms should never get a night out.__A shrill feature-length sitcom for the faith-based family values crowd, if nowhere near as good as that sounds.__None__None__None__None
"The Quiet Ones" simply has nothing to say.__The Quiet Ones is a pretty ironic title for a horror film whose primary scare tactic is to periodically crank up the volume, sending the needle to the red with a sudden spike in the decibel levels.__Unfortunately, it's all very familiar and somewhat tediously played out.__"The Quiet Ones" is rated PG-13, but it's scarier than R-rated gorefests, like "Proxy," "Nurse 3D," and "American Mary." Anyone can create disgust; creating slowly-building disquiet is entirely another proposition.__The Quiet Ones is uninspired even by contemporary horror standards - which comes as a bit of a shock, given its pedigree.__A retro possession story that will wind up being best remembered for its groovy '70s setting (lots of mutton-chop sideburns and T. Rex and Slade songs on the soundtrack) and a deliciously sinister performance from Jared Harris.__Hammer might be back, but the studio sure isn't hammering out anything that's remotely horrifying.__The story doesn't make much sense, starting with a professor blithely being awarded custody of a dangerous mental patient, and just going downhill from there.__Veteran screenwriter John Pogue, in his second directorial outing, tries repeatedly and mostly unsuccessfully to jolt his audience by amping up the abundant sound effects to ear-shattering levels.__Pogue jacks up the decibels so often to manufacture frights that you fear a punctured eardrum more than anything else.__Many of the movie's more nominally horrific elements are too familiar ...__It's the latest reminder that when a strange doctor invites you to work on an experiment in a secluded house, the answer should always be "No, thank you."__As an exercise in retro pastiche, it impresses. But as a postmodern genre reinvention, it fails to deliver.__There are a couple of decent jumps and a few giggles, but nothing armrest-clenchingly scary here.__There's little that's exactly new or fresh in Hammer Films' latest exercise in retro horror.__None__None__None__None__None
Problems abound from the rushed beginning all the way through the impossibly resolved ending.__The bricks are still yellow, but the road doesn't lead anywhere special.__It's short on jokes and hampered by unmemorable musical numbers (including one about building a boat), and the film's niceness can't overcome the dopey tedium.__It's a little shocking how leaden the jokes are in this movie.__All in all, the beloved kingdom of Oz is not well served, though there's just enough detectable affection to keep it from feeling like a pure cashing-in.__Devoid of the visual magic and heartfelt emotion of the original film, this version of Oz and Dorothy 2.0 feel like the cheaply made knockoffs you find in a dollar store: garishly shiny, flimsy and not built to last.__"Legends of Oz" feels like the opposite of the original film. Underneath its aggressive distractions and dim ideas, it has no heart.__The enterprise, while gently reverent, looks and feels as shaky as it sounds, tonally as flat as Kansas farmland.__There are songs, by a motley crew of tunesmiths who include Bryan Adams, but except for a showstopper tailor-made for Short, they don't make much of an impact. Ditto for the script ...__Feels like a formulaic knockoff of the original, replacing most everything whimsical about its predecessor with inane surrogates.__Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return is visually energetic but tonally all over the Yellow Brick Road map.__"Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return" lacks any sense of magic. These won't be songs you'll find yourself singing over and over after you've left the theater or a movie you'll be watching again and again. Once is enough.__[A] crass, cheap, hack-job cash-grab.__Mostly, the film reaffirms how hard it is to make a movie as unforgettable and enduring as "The Wizard of Oz." Good chance you'll forget this one on the way home from the theater.__Animated in form but completely listless in content.__"Oh, Toto, this doesn't look like the Oz I remember," Dorothy murmurs at one point. Truer words were never spoken.__[An] eyeball-gougingly ugly, charm-free animated musical sequel, which is inexplicably opening in thousands of theaters instead of going direct to video.__Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return fails to make us care about the characters or their journeys, and the animation is shoddy and occasionally creepy ...__None__None
Anderson moves further from conventional storytelling with each new film, and closer to something more intuitive, more damning, more true. He hasn't made it there yet. God help us when he does.__Some storylines conclude, some collide, others dissipate. But the film's main crime is this: It's boring.__Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as the perpetually befuddled Doc, a private detective of sorts who immerses himself in pot in the Los Angeles of 1970.__Although it's not as hermetic and impenetrable as The Master, Inherent Vice still comes off as a giant inside joke to anyone who hasn't read Pynchon's novel.__Inherent Vice is a sun-glared, neon-limned muddle of noir plotline and potheaded jokery that not only doesn't make sense, but actually seems to try hard not to.__I truly wanted to like the film. Unfortunately it is a huge letdown, an almost unbroken and utterly unsuccessful sequence of wrong choices.__Cockamamie, kaleidoscopic, languidly compelling ...__Even with a third eye on your forehead and peyote in your bloodstream, you won't be able to follow this long and winding road any better than Doc does.__"Inherent Vice" is an aggressively weird movie, which you should take not as a warning but as a compliment and an invitation to see it, to let its stoner vibes wash all over you.__Paul Thomas Anderson's hippie noir seems completely stoned: inarticulate, confused and prone to giggling at unknown jokes. Pynchon fans might tolerate it.__Both times I saw "Inherent Vice," I experienced roughly the same contradictory responses: delight undercut by puzzlement, followed by a happier sort of puzzlement.__The picture is all over the map. Nothing coheres.__Despite the film's frustrations, it must be acknowledged that Anderson -- a master of the multi-strand, multi-character, multi-meaning plot -- is the perfect director to adapt Pynchon, in terms of both craft and spirit.__More than just an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel, the film engages with the author's literature on the whole, attempting a filmic analogue to his virtuosic prose.__Some may find it sour and even repulsive, with its pathological anarchy of flavours. Some will find it delicious, in a deliriously exotic manner. Count me in the second camp.__Inherent Vice lives happily on the outer limits, where the noir form and its history are at least as important as the content.__Anderson seems to have lost all real pleasure in filmmaking; he seems to feel it's a kind of duty now, the weight of his various influences weighing him down and crushing the bright, grasping, sensitive artist who made Boogie Nights and Magnolia.__Too often, the film gets distracted with things to giggle at, and breaks the spell.__This "sunshine noir" bakes your brain, in a good way.__At first glance, Inherent Vice might seem to be a detective story. Look a little closer, however, and it becomes clear that this is Paul Thomas Anderson's idea of a comedy.
This is a garbage heap of weak quips, delivered by an assortment of pretty boys and girls and amped up with some cheesy moments of animal cruelty.__Not only plays like the crassest possible mashup of "Harry Potter" and "Twilight" elements, but seems designed to make those franchises look like eternal monuments of world culture by comparison.__This attempt to capture the magic of the "Twilight" and "Harry Potter" franchises tries too hard to pack all the backstory and borrowings into one film.__[Mr. Waters] doesn't seem especially interested in the supernatural parts of "Vampire Academy," and he clearly didn't have the budget to make what little hocus-pocus there is magical.__Ultimately more "Meaningless" than "Mean Girls," "Vampire Academy" is a busy, overcomplicated empowerment fantasy with more hormones than brain cells.__The only thing that distinguishes this teen-magnet wannabe from its predecessors is how lazily it appears to have been slapped together.__For smart, strong girls, and the guys who like them, Vampire Academy will hit a vein.__It's "Twilight" as directed by Mark Waters, of "Mean Girls." It's an idea that might have been intriguing 15 years ago, before those movies existed.__If a supernatural teen film ever required CliffsNotes, it would be this one.__One idea, mixed with lame jokes, and stretched beyond coherence. Vampire Academy doesn't need a review. It needs a stake in the heart.__For the target audience - teen girls likely to spend as much time gossiping in the theater lobby as they are to actually watch the movie - "Vampire Academy" is pure catnip.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
I didn't like anything about the movie before discovering what Guy is up to. I actively hated it after I figured out what was actually going on.__The laughs in this film are all mean-spirited or just frat-boy gross.__Almost unrelenting in its takedown both of an American institution and the country's obsession with victories big and small, Bad Words is more misanthropic fantasy than satiric fiction.__Trashy, ribald laughs in the Bad Santa vein, this marks Bateman's directorial debut; it's not much to look at, but at least he has the nerve to push the insolence, profanity, and brutal insult humor to its absolute limits.__In his directorial debut, Bateman casts himself as a foul-mouthed, racist jerk. It's a stretch for the nice-guy actor, but the role doesn't suit him.__While Bad Words is only sporadically funny, Bateman throws himself into the role without shame or ego. The film is also his directing debut, and a very capable one.__This is twisted, funny stuff.__Go see Bad Words for its breathtakingly wicked setup. Just be aware the spell wears off.__At heart, Bad Words is a nice little concoction about a fellow walking around with a deep emotional wound, who heals it, not by confronting the source of his troubles, but by healing a similar wound in someone else.__The film's problem is that, despite obvious aspirations to be more than just a profane joke factory, it never fulfills its dramatic ambitions.__It's nasty enough, but it isn't so much funny as it is pathological.__Bateman, who's so often the put-upon straight man, really stretches himself here. His deadpan delivery works just as well in the role of a wicked antihero as it does when he plays Michael Bluth in "Arrested Development."__Bateman is already a star pupil of comedy, and he could earn an honor's diploma in filmmaking if he learns to spell singularity.__What makes the comedy work is that Bateman doesn't relent. Guy is, simply, a loathsome person.__It's over long before it's over, by the time you start wishing that a few of the dogs from "Best in Show" would show up; a one-note comedy, pounded with a hammer and left flat.__Directed by Bateman in his first solo effort and written by Andrew Dodge, the film is an irreverant jape with its fair share of standout comic performances.__Once we understand what's driving Guy, the revelation is airless: It feels like too little, too late. Now we're supposed to care about whether he has feelings?__The film is at its best when it's hovering aimlessly without any apparent purpose in the world of this embittered, misanthropic little man.__"Bad Words" serves, at least, as proof that Bateman can do a variety of parts, and direct a smart economical comedy - and if Hollywood is as smart and economical, it will give him the chance again.__The performances are funny, appealing and, in the case of Allison Janney, as a spelling bee official, wonderful.
Cantinflas wears viewers down with earnest hero worship.__You're left with that empty feeling of a surface barely scratched, when the legend that was Cantinflas deserves much more.__While a substantial number of scenes are heavy-handed, the actor who plays Cantinflas- Oscar Jaenada - is a standout.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
What's wrong with The Interview is that it doesn't know how to be the singeing comedy it wants.__Te best satire provokes and even outrages, and Rogen, Franco and Goldberg certainly succeed on that score.__This is what all the fuss was about?__It's stupid. It's in bad taste. It impossible. I know all that. But Rogen's instinct to try anything for giggles and sticking it to dictatorial assholes is worth fighting for. Screw Kim if he can't take a joke.__It's certainly smutty-and infantile. Maybe half the jokes miss. But it is a truly savage work.__Everyone here is in way over his or her head.__Bluntly funny and ever-so-slightly sweet.__There's a whip-smart, pointed comedy in "The Interview." Unfortunately it's buried in there. Really deep.__Its lesson is that American pop culture is inescapable, our great achievement and most popular export, the weapon we wield abroad and the glue trap we struggle with at home.__The film is not a dangerous weapon, or a tool for anti-Korean propaganda. It does kill, but with comedy.__If you like your dictator mockery served on a sharper, smarter dish, you should probably just do what everyone else seems to be doing, and rewatch Team America: World Police.__Much of the film is devoted to the hit-and-miss (but strangely moving) riffing between the leading men.__Imagine "Harold and Kumar Go to North Korea," or "Bill and Ted's Excellent North Korean Adventure" or even "The Road to Pyongyang" starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. You get the idea.__Characterizing it as satire elevates the creative execution of the film's very silly faux assassination of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un far beyond what it merits.__Offers a few moments of casual brilliance but otherwise trips itself up in the threads of its contrived absurdity.__The remarkably dismal quality is emblematic of the mind-set that brought the movie, and its attendant crises, into being.__"The Interview" struggles to really illuminate anything about the stranger-than-fiction Orwellian nightmare that is North Korea, but its attempt is admirable. It deserves to be seen.__That something so carefully slapdash and happily juvenile actually resulted in cyber-sabotage and threats of violence is, in itself, an enormous kind of joke. Too bad it's the biggest one here.__Hate to say it, but this film ain't half the satire it could have been.__A dangerous comedy about a dangerous regime shouldn't be safe for suburban dads.
The film operates under the assumption that the average Joe associates Mormonism more with "Sister Wives" than Mitt Romney, so the film will be an eye-opener only for subscribers to such stereotypes.__The narration promises surprises ("This story may challenge what you think you know about the roles men and women play in Mormon homes"), but the movie might have started by examining its straw-man conception of the audience.__Would you go out of your way to see an infomercial that was more than an hour long? Would you even pay for the privilege? That's what "Meet the Mormons" would have filmgoers do.__Meet the Mormons isn't substantial enough to screen on the first day of LDS 101; the church's most basic tenets - and controversial aspects - are elided completely.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The underside of the American Dream is on display in A Most Violent Year, a drama about an immigrant trying to make his way to the top.__Chandor follows the psychologically penetrating tradition of Sidney Lumet, Alan Pakula and Francis Ford Coppola, observing crime as a microcosm of society.__Like that camel-hair coat Abel wears, A Most Violent Year is classy and commands respect, but a stronger pulse under the lapels would make us care much more.__[A] tight anti-thriller, one where the violence of the title is more implied than seen.__"A Most Violent Year" is a far more interesting film than its title implies. And a film you've never seen before.__Abel is a man with ideals in a world that has no use for them: If he's going to succeed, he's going to have to use his wits instead of bullets.__This isn't a revolutionary or thematically rich motion picture, but it's a well-told story featuring solid performances and a nice sense of atmosphere.__Gritty, suspenseful and almost poetic in its depiction of an unforgiving town, A Most Violent Year is just shy of being great.__A lot of movies spin their wheels fast and create the illusion that important things are happening. A Most Violent Year, one of the best movies of 2014, does the opposite.__Chandor, who previously wrote and directed "Margin Call" and "All Is Lost," is already a master storyteller, and "A Most Violent Year" unfolds with beautifully controlled tension.__[Isaac's] coiled, charismatic performance strongly evokes Al Pacino as the young Michael Corleone, and Chandor's intelligent screenplay turns on a similar dilemma of how to maintain one's personal ethics in a cutthroat environment.__"A Most Violent Year" sets the stage for a showdown between principles and base instincts that never satisfyingly arrives.__"Year" is a fascinating movie but, despite its title, it's fairly flat - the pace rarely modulates. A work to admire, sometimes very much, but not an easy one to love.__"A Most Violent Year" is an engrossing, often beautiful film, and a breakout opportunity for Isaac, whose similarly self-contained performance as a sadly self-aware folk singer in "Inside Llewyn Davis" was unfortunately overlooked last year.__Chandor has yet to learn the fine points of screw-turning when a story's momentum calls for it. But he knows a great deal about writing effective, striving, eagle-eyed characters caught in tricky situations.__"A Most Violent Year," for all its other virtues, is a wise movie about leadership.__Recognize J.C. Chandor as one of the most exciting writers and directors working today - after all of three films.__The performances are memorable. Isaac uses understatement with the appropriate emotional outburst and Chastain is the film's firecracker.__Oscar Isaac has been extremely good in previous roles, but he is an utter revelation as Abel, the quiet power of his performance recalling early Pacino.__The movie runs just over two hours, and Chandor keeps the movie almost antiseptically tight. He's proving to be a smart director whose skill is growing astronomically in three movies.
It should have been made 40 years ago, but this biopic about the Mexican-American leader who spearheaded the fight for farmworkers' rights couldn't be more timely.__Cesar Chavez makes for a fine history lesson, but as drama, it leaves something to be desired.__Michael Pena brings a centered, beckoning beauty to the title character that manages to speak to Chavez nonviolent approach without becoming hagiographic.__Biopics about civil rights icons are usually staid affairs. Cesar Chavez, directed by Diego Luna, is no exception.__With Pena, the question is this: Are the movies brave enough to give him the chance he deserves? He's a wonderful Cesar Chavez.__An amateurish mess, with faltering direction and wooden acting.__The man was a more interesting person than the poster-ready icon presented here.__The results can be surprisingly rich, lucid and subtle.__A solid and mostly successful attempt to introduce this important labor leader and civil rights activist to younger audiences, while reminding older folks of the impact Chavez had on this country.__As a filmmaker, Luna is still finding his voice. For all he effectively puts on screen in "Cesar Chavez," Luna never gets past his respect for the accomplishments to give us a true measure of the man.__Not only powerful but timely, given divided attitudes toward immigration and unionization.__A well-cast, well-intentioned movie that falls into the trap that often awaits film biographies of brave and widely admired individuals.__The performances are solid but I walked out of the theater thinking I might have been equally edified and entertained reading the man's Wikipedia entry.__If you can survive Nixon, maybe you can survive anything. But it will take a better movie than this to show how.__Wades only ankle-deep into some complicated territory.__[Pena] doesn't get to do much more than recite trite adages offered by a disjointed, sometimes inscrutable script.__Just as the migrant workers of California deserved better treatment from their bosses, the man who won the labor dispute deserves better treatment than this film.__Michael Pena is particularly impressive in the lead, resisting the obvious temptation to make Chavez larger than life. Diego Luna, a fine actor himself, directed, grounding the story in earthy, authentic-seeming detail.__The film is always a little bit at a distance, almost involving, always good enough to make us root for it, but rarely better than average.__The problem with Cesar Chavez is that it inches steadily away from a down-to-earth portrayal of its subject, eventually placing him on the very kind of pedestal he never sought to occupy.
"The Skeleton Twins" is a lovingly calibrated mix of heartbreak and hopefulness, guilt and the will to do better.__Johnson's unfussy direction serves as a fine showcase for the two SNL veterans to demonstrate how their comic shorthand plays equally well in a slightly darker register.__The Skeleton Twins is all the better for keeping us guessing as to its intentions, because that makes it more true to life. Sometimes you have to smile through the tears, and vice-versa.__If a movie with suicide as a central theme can be deemed funny, then writer/director Craig Johnson has pulled it off, mixing heartache and humor and giving Wiig, especially, the opportunity to shine.__Even with performers as likable as Hader and Wiig, and characters as likable as Milo and Maggie, sympathy should be earned. Like an cocksure banker, Johnson takes our investment for granted.__In a poignant and potentially depressing film, it's redeeming to see that when they are with their kindred spirits, even the saddest skeletons can dance.__Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig ... turn their talents toward some really heavy drama, while managing to serve up a few laughs along the way.__The filmmakers think the comedy is where all the humanity is, and maybe they're right. But they don't take humor far enough.__The direction has no style, and the script has no perspective; the result is drama by number.__The Skeleton Twins is quietly smart, sweet but never syrupy. It should erase any doubt that its two stars, who rose to success as cut-ups, also have dramatic chops.__Low-fi and engaging, sometimes mordantly hilarious and at other moments genuinely touching, the movie suffers both from the Flat Hipster Affect that can stunt independent films and from more calculated mainstream touches.__If "sad comedy" is a genre, Craig Johnson's thoughtful, touching film fits right in.__Writing and directing his second feature, Craig Johnson demonstrates a knowing sense of how consciously, and helplessly, some people destroy themselves.____This is a smart movie. Wiig gives maybe the most impressive performance of her career, and Hader is equally good.__Hader and Wiig give rich, nuanced performances that reflect the chemistry the two actors honed together from their years on Saturday Night Live.__The characters and their anxieties are for the most part nicely judged.__At its best, The Skeleton Twins exudes the vague unease of two putative grown-ups trying to stifle their awareness that the lives they've chosen neither fit nor suit them.__The film is a mite tidy in that Sundance Workshop way, but it's very enjoyable, and Johnson has a deft touch with actors.__As we enter this season of big, important awards contenders that "matter," "The Skeleton Twins" is a small, intimate gem that might truly matter.
The film is one of the most rapturously beautiful that Miyazaki has made, and all the more unsettling because of it.__The pastel palette bespeaks a determined, almost demented lightness.__At 73, Miyazaki's farewell is many things -- gorgeous, beckoning, compassionate. For better and worse, it soars above child's play.__When Jiro dreams, "Wind" soars; when he comes down to earth, the film can feel a bit stiff and murky. But then, that may be the point.__The Wind Rises has the sweep and majesty of a Technicolor Hollywood classic.__In terms of tone, visual beauty, and storytelling, The Wind Rises represents Miyazaki at the apex of his abilities.__A work of immense mystery and strangeness, loaded with unforgettable images, spectacular sweeps of color and nested, hidden meanings.__The movie's story and visuals are all of a piece. The incidents are layered; the wind reveals their secrets.__Koreans, Chinese and others who experienced war atrocities at the hands of the Japanese have accused the film of political irresponsibility. But its real agenda, if you look carefully, is quite another matter.__Gorgeous, wondrous and troubling.__The view is beautiful, but the loftier aims of "The Wind Rises" fall short.__The beauty of "The Wind Rises" - and it really is gorgeous - does not mask the troublesome aspects of its story, or of human nature itself.__An ode to flight and a celebration of living with one's head in the clouds.__Everything is invested with spirit: levers, flaps, and, of course, the wind.__The Wind Rises has the historical sweep of a David Lean picture, complete with panoramic shots of migrating populations against a background of disaster ...__While it's not quite as magical as some of his previous films, it makes a fitting and often moving farewell.__Miyazaki isn't taking sides, merely observing how the winds of fate often propel us into situations not entirely of our choosing and open to interpretation.__Visually, "The Wind Rises" is a thing of sensual, contemplative poetry, from the pearlescent cloudscapes and verdant countryside of Horikoshi's youth to the hulking gray factories he visits in prewar Germany as a young man.__The movie's a gorgeous, problematic anomaly in an illustrious career-a case of rapturous artistic blindness.__The Wind Rises may come as a shock for fans of the kid-friendly, pro-feminist, deeply pacifist Miyazaki... It's a big story, and in this landmark film Miyazaki is up to every demand.
It's a wicked, violent parable, and one of the only movies of the summer worth talking about after the credits roll.__"Snowpiercer" warms the heart, but doesn't penetrate it.__Once Mr. Bong sets his monorail in motion the movie assumes an irresistible momentum, accelerated by nonstop mayhem, gallows humor and an immersive visual style that possesses a heady sense of the steam-punk Apocalypse.__This is powerful stuff, and all the more so for its straightforwardness.__There's a righteous savagery to this movie that's almost but not quite obscured by the lushness of its imagined world.__It's so hard to describe how amazing Snowpiercer is without giving away everything that makes it amazing.__You couldn't ask for a better metaphor for hell on Earth than what Bong Joon-ho has wrought with Snowpiercer: constant forward momentum while getting absolutely nowhere, suffering all the while.__Violent, often absurd, but full of brilliant surprises.__The future is miserably dystopian as usual in this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, but at least it's thoughtful, stylishly crafted, high-speed misery that keeps on hurtling relentlessly forward -- even though there's nowhere to go.__It's a downbeat spectacle. But very good, unforgettably bizarre, original filmmaking and adventurously explored ideas can leave you feeling high, especially when you don't know quite how it's been pulled off.__As with The Host, the political satire is teased out gradually as the story progresses and never intrudes on one's enjoyment of the movie's richly imagined world.__In the thick of summer, while Hollywood is busy cranking out cookie-cutter superhero movies and giant robot sequels, along comes Snowpiercer to show everyone how it's done.__A rococo exercise in mayhem, boldfaced allegory and ramped-up chaos. It's a summer movie with a social conscience.__Although there is plenty to think about here, it's best not to overthink it. Just hang on and enjoy the ride.__A formidable, if perversely overlong epic, Snowpiercer is a dystopian moral parable about survivors of a second ice age that wipes out virtually all humanity.__This is brilliant, bizarre, fearless filmmaking.__In different hands, Snowpiercer might have been just another generic action movie. Yet with South Korean director Bong Joon-ho at the helm, it's instead something more off-kilter and more disturbingly satisfying.__Subtlety may not be the film's strong suit, but it creates a richly imagined world, as glitteringly arresting as it is savagely merciless.__"Snowpiercer" is a full-throttle science fiction adventure and a resonant modern myth.__The best action film of 2014, and probably the best film, period.
The filmmakers don't have the nerve for a serious consideration of trauma, vengeance, and forgiveness.__The critical problems are an overbusy time-jumping script and reliance on the conventions of the trauma drama - flashbacks, fragmentation, distorted time and space - that prove more a barrier than a window into the character's inner lives.__Beautifully acted, The Railway Man is profoundly moving, and yet, somehow, its sentimental ending manages to be both unearned and predictable.__Why does the movie leave one cold?__The quality of mercy isn't just strained in The Railway Man, it's measured out by the teaspoonful.__The truth of what happened to him is devastating; the truth of how he found forgiveness in his soul is astonishing.__A consistently fine actor, Firth does marvelous work here, as Lomax must balance the demons of his past with the specter of forgiveness.__"The Railway Man" is a polished locomotive that never builds up steam or deviates from its timetable.__Firth and Kidman are both up for the challenge, complementing the compelling story with measured and memorable performances.__A prestige film that sometimes feels more like a history assignment than entertainment.__Makes its targets clear: redemption, love, healing, handkerchiefs.__The story, based on Lomax's memoir, is compelling. Jonathan Teplitzky's insipid screen version doesn't do the rich material justice.__Throughout, Firth compellingly plays a man struggling to make sense of the ordeal that his life has become. Too often, though, you can feel the movie struggling right along with him.__It's a good, slick and well-intentioned film that wants so hard to be an important one that the slight feeling of letdown it leaves is magnified.__The cast is excellent and the screenplay, by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Andy Paterson, is delicately attuned to the emotional cost of war and the terrible struggle to be healed.__[It] has many problems but also has Colin Firth ...__A morally admirable but dramatically inert case of high-minded reconciliation ...__Firth is very good at playing racked men of high principle.__Throughout his career, Firth repeatedly has proven himself to be a master at steadily revealing his characters, and the way his Lomax eventually reclaims his identity before enjoying some redemption is gently stirring.__In the end, for a movie about such a grim and grotesque chapter in history "The Railway Man" commits the most improbable sin of all. It's dull.
The best moments get to the heart of Simien's thesis that what is supposed to be post-racial America isn't all that much different from what came before.__A timely and important look at black identity and how it's informed by by stereotypes in the media__Where it scores big is its wealth of ideas-visual, emotional, cultural-and its deep well of bitter, voice-of-experience rage__Screenplay is tight, funny, smart and insightful, and [the] direction has just enough indie feel without becoming too self-conscious or preachy.__The pitch on Dear White People is that it's "Do the Right Thing for the Obama generation," which is both an oversell and a disservice to Justin Simien's witty satire about race relations on a fictional Ivy League campus.__The message gets a little scattershot and repetitive at times, but he hits his mark more often than not.__A rickety contraption of issue-oriented talking points delivered by characters-centrally, four black students-who are constructed to fit the plot.__Writer-director Justin Simien takes a sledgehammer to the rosy notion that we've achieved a post-racial utopia - but he does it with great wit, bite and flair - in his debut feature, Dear White People.__The gags create a fuse to a firecracker finale.__One of the freshest, funniest, boldest debut films to come along in years.__Simien draws strong performances from his talented cast and has a clean visual sensibility. But he's still sifting through the issues he raises and the movie suffers from his lack of conviction.__Writer-director Justin Simien's searing, sharp-edged, and wildly intelligent comedy about race relations on an American college campus.__You have to see this movie, and talk about it, to believe it.__As a first-time director, Simien sometimes lets his script flirt with talkiness, but with dialogue this sharp and unpredictable, who's complaining?__The issues are more interesting than the characters, though Simien provides a welcome and fairly trenchant [film].__Although the characters don't lapse into stereotypes, neither are they sufficiently funny or fierce to engage us in the issues they raise. The movie is a windy debate, the kind that is suited for the safe confines of a college campus.__It's a slyly provocative achievement and a serious calling card for its writer-director, Justin Simien.__A witty movie and in many places a funny one.__A film that is unafraid to tackle a subject as difficult and complex as race - and does so with intelligence, courage and humor.__It will make some people squirm and might hurt some viewers' feelings, but will likely make them laugh along the way. One way or another, it's a film that will prompt plenty of conversation on the way home.
There's nothing wildly original here, but it's carried off with charm and wit, and a pair of very enjoyable central performances.__A lovely little film from a place where the little things linger.__"The Lunchbox" doesn't offer easy solutions, but it is filled with keen observations. All meals should be this satisfying.__A pleasure, from the fascinating intricacies of Mumbai-style interlocking lunch containers to the quietly masterful performance of Khan.__Warm, and warmly predictable.__"The Lunchbox" is a feast of delights, one of the best stories about the connection between food and love the movies have ever seen.__"What do we live for?" is the question that pops up in The Lunchbox, a romance set in Mumbai. The film, a first feature from Ritesh Batra, aims to offer a meaningful answer: We live, ideally, for love.__If co-writer and director Ritesh Batra occasionally takes his sweet time getting from point A to point B, it's equally true that he gives the audience a nice, comfortable ride.__A humanist fable from India, the film is actually a romance in the classic tradition, a "Brief Encounter" transposed to the rhythms and flavors of modern-day Mumbai.__A romantic comedy based on the most trifling and sentimental of conceits, while deftly avoiding a descent into schmaltz.__Atouching and credible story that easily draws the viewer into the lives of its characters.__From the start, the movie mingles savory realism with elements of magic.__As in an old Nora Ephron comedy, each of the prospective lovers is supplied with an irritating comic foil.__Like a lot of movies, but especially foreign films, "The Lunchbox" has a central idea and winning characters, and it builds a compelling situation.__This gentle romantic drama, by the Indian director Ritesh Batra, packs twenty minutes of action into its hour-and-three-quarters running time.__Batra deftly finesses the will-they-or-won't-they potholes in the plot. If he never quite moves the story into Chekhovian terrain, he does at least manage to make it into something more than an Indian O. Henry knockoff.__It's a slight idea for a film, but director Ritesh Batra (who also cowrote) nicely expands it ...__This warm and affectionate human comedy from India is charming in a delicate and unforced way.__The Lunchbox is a first feature for director Ritesh Batra, but it nicely captures the almost overwhelming crush and noise of contemporary India, and it plays cleverly and delicately with the tension of whether its two correspondents might eventually meet.__For the acting alone, "The Lunchbox" is a sumptuous treat.
It's too twee and theatrical to take seriously.__My Old Lady feels as stubbornly stuck in that expansive and underlit apartment as Madame Girard herself, and you may find yourself bolting for a lungful of relief.__One minute we're chuckling along with a broadly comic setup; the next, characters are talking about suicide.__There's a potentially compelling movie here about the price that children pay-over entire lifetimes-for their parents' selfish indulgences, but it winds up smothered in feel-good cuteness.__Kline's character is an alcoholic and not exactly lovable, but we come to empathize. Smith, the grande dame of British theater and film, is wickedly wry and quick.__What starts as an elaborate sitcom becomes an emotionally substantial tragicomedy.__Horovitz may have made a questionable decision in adapting this particular play for the screen, but his casting was flawless.__If sad, fearful adult lives wrecked by depression, divorce, disappointment, adultery, addiction and family dysfunction are your thing, "My Old Lady" is pour vous.__One finds oneself wishing to spend many a dinner with Smith and Kline as conversation partners, as their banter is both humorous and razor-edged.__Kline has fun with the role, but the plot's dark turn and heavy-handed message make "My Old Lady" more bitter than sweet.__The expected twinkle never really leaves "My Old Lady," but it certainly goes through some rough times along the way. And the film is all the more interesting as a result.__"My Old Lady" is affecting, even if many of the revelations and high-voltage speeches occur at predictable moments. But if you can look past this formulaic side, it's a movie worth seeing.__This is a promising premise and the cast is certainly game. But it's as if the actors are emoting into a canyon - or, more accurately, a narrow hallway.__The setup might seem familiar and charming, but this film's payoffs come from unexpected places and require an audience's willingness to travel down some dark and rocky paths.__"My Old Lady" certainly has satisfactions, but they are incomplete ones.__The performances go a long way toward camouflaging the screenplay's clunky mechanics. Mr. Kline's performance, in particular, infuses a story of father-son strife with emotional heat.__Anyone who's not profiting directly from this arrangement won't want to stick around to hash out the details.__The film never manages to transcend its actors-workshop aura and develop into something deeper.__Whatever qualms one might have about the tidy parallels in its characters' emotional breakthroughs, it should be warmly greeted by grown-up moviegoers seeking adult but not overly weighty material.__None
Mike Leigh's biopic is so richly detailed that it feels like a documentary. Spall goes for broke in the outsize title role.__At 150 minutes, it's a little too long but there are stretches during its course when it captivates and amazes.__You leave "Mr. Turner," as with all good fact-based films, wanting to know more about this man and his work - and remembering that beautiful, almost touchable light, on the canvas and on the screen.__For modern moviegoers, the earthy "Mr. Turner" may seem like slowly steeped tea with an unpleasant aftertaste. But while some are impatiently waiting for the paint to dry, astute viewers will see a cinematic landscape bloom.__If the past is a foreign country, then "Mr. Turner" is one of the most rhapsodic foreign films you may ever see.__Mr. Turner is no barrel of laughs. It's a barrel of life - an extraordinary one.__Mr. Turner, like just about all movies made by Mike Leigh, creates the sensation of being in a vividly realized mini-universe built from the ground up.__An inspired film, a beautiful exploration of art and creation and difficulty, with Spall's brilliant performance at its center.__Timothy Spall gives an admirably warty and unpleasant performance as Turner, an arrogant and uncompromising man who's annoyed by his celebrity in Britain but shocked when the public turns against his work.__A gorgeous, important film.__Failure isn't only the province of the lazy and uninspired. No, even the gifted and conscientious must occasionally take a stroll through that blasted landscape, and with Mr. Turner Leigh does it, for 2 1/2 hours. Don't go with him.__Epic in breadth and length (2 1/2 hours), and gorgeously photographed (digitally) by Bill Pope, Mr. Turner is intimate in incident.__As is usual with any Mike Leigh film -- a style unique and trademarked by now -- his ensemble is a collection of remarkably adept actors who know their characters so well they could stay in character for weeks, continually improvising, as they often do.__To use a word often associated with Turner and his art, it's sublime.__Mr. Turner manages to illuminate that nexus between biography and art with elegant understatement.__The gap between the celestial art of the great English romantic painter Joseph Mallord William Turner and the brutish details of his life is vividly explored in Mike Leigh's tragicomic movie Mr. Turner.__A vacuous endurance test about an abstract loser.__I can't say enough about the power of Spall's performance.__Keen observer Mike Leigh brings his hawk's eye to a vibrant rendering of J.M.W. Turner, the celebrated British "painter of light."__"Mr. Turner" is a rich portrait of England at a particularly scabrous period.
Ida is not only an evocation of early '60s Poland, the period of Pawlikowski's childhood, but a film that gives the illusion that it could have been made then.__Now that Pawe&#322; Pawlikowski's haunting Polish film has been nominated for a foreign-language Oscar, Ida is back in the conversation. Let yourself be enveloped by a modern cinema classic.__Nestled within its sins-of-the-elders narrative is a faintly charming cross-generational bonding picture, pairing a worldly cynic with a young girl taking her last gasp of secular air before giving her life to the Lord.__With her brassy, determined aunt, Ida sets off to find answers and discovers life beyond the convent walls in this leisurely but satisfying journey.__Consider "Ida" the first offering in a summer celebrating Polish cinema and the latest masterpiece in a powerful tradition.__In the end, Ida has to confront where she's come from, decide who she is and who she wants to be. Then again, don't we all?__As the heroine who bounces back from one potential catastrophe after another, Trzebuchowska always suggests resilience. She's got a lot on her mind, but we know she'll survive.__A film with meat and bones sorely lacking in heart.__A thing of beauty that overstays its welcome. It's possible that Pawlikowski would be a great artist if he weren't so hellbent on convincing us of it.__A masterpiece.__"Ida" is a story of faith and identity, an exquisite, austere drama in a plaintive minor key.__The Polish drama "Ida" is a rarity, a film both intensely grounded in painful historical reality and genuinely otherworldly.__Spare, haunting and in its own way beautiful, "Ida" is an absorbing film about discovering the truth, and the attendant price we pay to learn it.__Ida reaches spiritual depth through affecting performances rendered in sublime black-and-white compositions. Cinematographer Lukasz Zal places faces in the lower corner of his frame to arresting effect.__For a film about grave moral questions and contradictions, "Ida" possesses more than its share of sensory pleasures ...__"Ida" accomplishes so much, so surely in its 80 minutes, it's as if the director Pawel Pawlikowski had dared himself: How can I tell this fascinating story efficiently yet without rushing and abridging the narrative?__Likely to remain the best movie of the year.__The parable resonates emotionally thanks to Trzebuchowska's performance.__A stunning character portrait of survival and loss.__[The] screenplay is a model of economy, as precise as the lensing by Ryszard Lenczewski and Lukasz Zal, who often position their subjects at the bottom of the frame, emphasizing personal insignificance within the totalitarian machine.
The preposterousness of this plot marks Fading Gigolo as a vanity project, but it's hard to take Turturro too much to task when he hits so many other grace notes in between blowing his own horn.__The premise is preposterous and many of the gags are tasteless, yet the tone is gentle, even elegiac, and the players are surprisingly sensitive.__A story that pretends to be about sex but is actually focused on revealing the true nature of intimacy.__"Fading Gigolo" may be far from perfect, but it's near impossible to dislike.__The chemistry is just right between Allen and Turturro, who immediately register as best friends for life, and between Stone and Turturro, whose mutual awkwardness gives way to a goofy form of passion.__While Allen emerges from this mash-up relatively unscathed, Turturro as an implausible male prostitute gets maimed at the intersection of comedy and drama.__A slight movie but enjoyable nevertheless even if its brevity hints at something that, given more time to breathe, could have been a richer, more rewarding experience.__This movie was doomed from draft one of the script.__Fading Gigolo gets an extra star merely for showcasing the egg cream, the Brooklyn beverage that is the nectar of the gods. Shalom!__As a filmmaker, Turturro evokes a sense of this community that's surprisingly nuanced and rich.__The tone swoops from touching drama to hambone commedia dell'arte without setting a foot wrong.__A slight, minor comedy that feels like something Woody Allen might have come up with on a lazy afternoon.__Aside from Allen, "Fading Gigolo" is a rather grim movie.__Artful, insightful and at times very, very funny, much of its wry humor is due to Allen, who co-stars opposite Turturro.__Turturro's direction owes a little something to Spike Lee, and a lot to Woody Allen.__What puts Fading Gigolo over the top is the presence of Allen, who's just the sort of earthy, fast-talking foil the moony Turturro needs.__Mr. Turturro's musical choices in "Fading Gigolo" tend to feel, like so much here, generically applied instead of meaningfully coaxed from some essential, lived-in truth.__Turturro has many dots that he never connects here.__This tall-tale New York comedy about a florist and a book dealer who become a prostitute and a pimp is so wispy that it's hit or miss and overlong at 90 minutes.__A slight, comical and intermittently affecting film about loneliness and desire.
The tension of Calvary is fitful at best, and much of the movie trips into silliness, but in Brendan Gleeson -- in his proud bearing and his lamenting gaze -- we see the plight of the lonely believer in a world beyond belief.__Brendan Gleeson delivers a typically towering yet warm performance in "Calvary." Too bad the movie's something of a mess.__It serves as a marvelous showcase for Gleeson, a great old-lion actor who shows, in the film's many close-ups, a quiet, weary yet unbending faith, and a face on which emotion can play like a wave on the beach.__Both the comedy and the violence are watered down by a dark melancholy.__A dark and profoundly funny tale of an institution failing its sheep and its best shepherds.__To say Gleeson "stars" in Calvary seems inadequate. He dominates it ...__"Calvary" is often wound tightest in the most unexpected places.__[Gleeson] projects fierce intelligence, wit, gentleness, ruefulness, soulfulness.__Gleeson is the great anchor of the piece, conveying much often without even saying a word.__It doesn't confront church scandal-priestly crime; it stares into the spiritual void that has been left in its wake. What stares back is lurid, soulless and damned.__The irony and fatalism that have driven "Calvary" forward reach an end point that, while doubtlessly dramatic, doesn't jibe with the Father James we've come to know and love.__Gleeson brings his usual fierceness and gravity to the role, and there are fine supporting turns by Chris O'Dowd, Kelly Reilly, Aiden Gillen, and Dylan Moran.__Gleeson is remarkable in one of the best roles for one of the finest character actors around, who is finally, with this and McDonagh's last film, "The Guard," getting his shot at lead roles.__I imagine most people will watch the film and merely see the village as populated by vivid eccentrics. But a closer look at these odd, bitter, hostile characters will suggest something darker at work.__Gleeson carries the film with wonderful, natural authority. He's a little better than the movie itself, which is glib to a fault.__I've seen so many movies, with great dialogue, that aren't about anything; here's a film on a fascinating subject, but the dialogue is terrible.__Calvary is bleak and corrosively funny in about equal measure.__Calvary gives Gleeson ample opportunity to explore his talent for anchoring a movie, making it deeper and richer than the script and direction might otherwise allow.__Gleeson is a wonderful actor and he keeps a lid on the blarney. He manages to convey a lot -- fear, anger, compassion, rue -- with only the slightest of squints and frowns. But he's still the center of a cooked-up cavalcade of souls.__Good actors like Chris O'Dowd, Moran, Gleeson, and Walsh are acting their hearts out, but they can't make these characters seem like more than puppets.
Wish I Was Here's philosophical scope never gets much bigger than the slip of paper inside a fortune cookie.__It is sometimes maudlin, sometimes trivial and sometimes very moving, but never less than achingly sincere.__The fruits of writer-director Zach Braff's Kickstarter are here for the general public, and they're at once vibrantly weird, beautiful and thoughtful.__Braff plays Aidan with easygoing exasperation and Hudson is better than I've seen her since Almost Famous.__Wish I Was Here is a funny, touching movie that features one of Kate Hudson's best performances and a curmudgeonly good one from Mandy Patinkin.__"Wish I Was Here" is a welcome, if belated, second chapter in a filmmaker's career. I just hope we don't have to wait another 10 years to see what he thinks about life as a forty-something ...__"Wish I Was Here" sets up some big moments but doesn't follow through on them, emotionally or otherwise. Like its title implies, it's absent at its own party.__I wish Wish I Was Here made me care more about this guy's woes, but there's a patness to the weepy scenarios. To the funny ones, too.__An uneven, sometimes charming, sometimes amateurish exploration of a particular time in a still-young man's life.__What's it about? Everything and nothing. Seriously: If wishes were horses, one would have walked into the movie and told us what exactly Braff thought was going on.__For a film that purports to be about the process of maturity and growth, it is woefully un-evolved, lacking in understanding and insight.__Sophomore slumps don't come any more irritating than "Wish I Was Here," the painfully sincere, emotionally fraudulent new comedy-drama from actor-writer-director Zach Braff.__There's a valid comedy-drama in the story of a man who can't tell if his lifelong ambition is a true passion or a pipe dream, but Braff prefers facile life lessons and slow-motion hugging to tough questions.__A heartfelt if heavy-handed sermon about chasing dreams, forgiving sins and honoring Woody Allen.__Braff tries to cram so much into it, no scene ever exists for its own sake, to establish rhythm or help us know these characters outside of the ongoing family crises.__If I were one of the generous and optimistic contributors to Zach Braff's Kickstarter campaign to fund Wish I Was Here, I'd ask for my money back. All of it.__Watery at best, whiny at its worst ...__The earlier, comedic scenes work a lot better than the later, dramatic ones, thanks mainly to Braff's wide-eyed, deadpan performance and good supporting work from Kate Hudson.__For audiences seeking shelter from superhero carnage, "Wish I Was Here" is a lovely place to be.__Braff struggles with shifting tones while mismanaging his own character. It's easier to appreciate the effort than it is to enjoy the film.
I suppose the relationship is Oedipal or primal or something or other, but mostly it's just an excuse for Dolan to stage a series of gaudy shout-fests.__A story of the combative relationship between a mother and her son filled with delirious swells of effusive love and sudden plummets into madness and hate.__Dolan is able to weave dialogue, camerawork, a fluid yet urgent editing style, and a magpie's ear for pop music into a cinematic world that you can almost hold in your hand before it starts spilling over.__The movie's overlong, underpopulated and often devastating to watch. But it's told with an uncanny realism, and when it's over you feel shaken and a little sick - and realize that you can finally exhale.__Mother and son gesticulate wildly but remain undefined; Dolan's blandly showy aesthetic matches the vainly hectic action.__Dolan is only 25, and though he doesn't have Orson Welles beat, this has to be one of the best films ever written and directed by a 25-year-old.__"Mommy" is a shockingly honest, nerve-wracking and dazzling piece of cinema. If this doesn't rattle your soul, you don't have one.__Scary and wild, forthright and furious.__The volatile, unbridled emotion of "Mommy" - its sheer life force - makes up for its structural weaknesses ...__The movie's rhythm is jumpy, accelerated and alive.__Xavier Dolan ranks as the most accomplished young dramatic filmmaker in North America, and this engrossing character study, his fifth feature, demonstrates an emotional perspicacity one might expect from an artist many years his senior.__Heartbreaking, if you can get past all the yelling.__"Mommy" is a passionate and generous portrait of three intersecting lives on the drab outer margins of middle-class society, told without condescension or sugary coating by an artist taking full command of his powers.__Left me not unmoved but mostly annoyed.__Clocking in at an unfiltered - some would call indulgent - 129 minutes, Mommy gives the impression of having burst straight from Dolan's instincts onto the screen.__[It] can be seen as a tribute to maternal devotion, though I saw it for a long time as a study in perilous self-delusion.__Boasting dynamite performances, "Mommy" excels as a confrontational, compassionate melodrama about the anguishing dilemmas of caretaking. It's a revelation.__Though not a musical, "Mommy" often feels like one as it swells and ebbs on the melodramatic currents of love, pain and frustration. It is also, within its very modest means, formally audacious.__You feel the movie closing in on you the same way that life is closing in on the characters.__Even when director Dolan gets self-indulgent, he's a one-man fireworks display. His images jump off the screen. And just watch Anne Dorval. She practically dares you not to.
Nerd wish-fulfillment of the first order, this Canadian rom-com places an artificial barrier between its cute-as-a-button leads and asks us to stick around for an hour and a half until it's artificially removed.__Long before the script permits the characters to acknowledge the obvious, you lose patience: Jump into the deep end of the bed already. It would be more fun and friendly to all concerned, especially the audience.__The dialogue is believable and funny, even if strays a little too often into the grotesque eating and toilet habits of the late Elvis Presley.__For a kid who grew up in public and is worth an estimated 60 million, Daniel Radcliffe does a convincing job of playing a normal guy.__Director Michael Dowse ("Take Me Home Tonight") can't quite decide on a tone -- sly, whimsical or wacky? -- but the problem is the material.__"What If" flies by on the instant and lasting chemistry between leads Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan.__It feels familiar and the appeal of the leads can't fully compensate for unremarkable dialogue and the obligatory (but nevertheless irritating) "romantic complications" subplot.__While What If does have its blemishes -- there are times when it's just too cute for its own good -- it's so enjoyable from moment to moment that it's easy to forgive.__This is standard rom-com terrain, and, as directed by Michael Dowse and written by Elan Mastai, it doesn't fly high. At times it's rather sweet, though, and Radcliffe and Kazan have a nice nerds-in-clover rapport.__In many ways, What If takes us down a road that When Harry Met Sally first traveled a quarter-century ago. Yet I didn't really mind revisiting the old friend vs. lover discussion, especially one with a contemporary slant and solid dialogue.__I'll admit it: I fell hard for What If, even as I realized that in an alternate universe I may have wanted to punch all of these characters out.__What If doesn't break new ground. But it has charm to spare, and Radcliffe and Kazan are irresistible. No ifs about it.__Spall is likable, Kazan is adorable, Driver is amusing enough as the blowhard best friend, and Radcliffe as Wallace is . . . a passive-aggressive lump.__Even if the movie feels headed in a predictable direction, it's fun to follow it, and even if the characters sound a little interchangeable, it's still amusing to hear them speak.__It's Radcliffe and Kazan, clinking their takeout coffees (well, there's no clink in cardboard, is there?) and radiating soulful desire and distress, that make What If more than just an iffy affair.__Once you get past the film's been-there theme - Can a straight man and a woman just be friends? - it's essentially, "Check, please."__A film that is like one extended, excruciating anticlimax.__There's nothing unfamiliar or unconventional about the thoroughly charming indie rom-com "What If" - but that is precisely this movie's secret.__In the absence of novelty, execution becomes vital, and What If hits its marks with wit, consistency and even a bit of visual inventiveness.__A balloon of cuteness that makes you yearn for a pin, "What If" is Saturday night comfort food for those who need to believe that even the most curdled among us can find a mate.
The remake never manages to drum up much excitement for its sleepy hamlet rousing or for its characters, finally filled with purpose.__The filmmakers hope for a fable-like charm rather than gritty credibility, but the whole thing feels as cynical as the villagers' convoluted mission.__Thanks to its cast, "The Grand Seduction" turns out to be, if not exactly groundbreaking, at least agreeable, comfortable fun.__It's all very sweet. And a big stretch.__Loved Local Hero? Charmed by Waking Ned Devine? Then go watch Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine.__So intricately plotted and unlikely that it verges on the exotic, "The Grand Seduction" is nevertheless a hoot.__A fish-out-of-water fable set within a fabulously scenic backdrop, against which wholesome humor and a thoroughgoing humanist streak play out and intertwine with gentle, unforced ease.__The more this predictable, faux-endearing Canadian comedy works at being irresistible, the harder it is to enjoy.__Translating its accessible premise too cleanly, Grand Seduction neglects the rough edges of character, the very details that make a place and its people memorable to a visitor. They're also what convince a person to stay.__By and large, the film's folksiness bucks schmaltz.__Ah, those wacky foreigners and their impossibly charming villages.__Gleeson and the collection of good-natured seniors with accents will win your heart.__The movie equivalent of a warm blanket.__"The Grand Seduction" has a sober vibe and a methodical pace, and yet there are more than a few moments that are laugh-out-loud funny.__More bland than grand, and more eccentric than seductive.__A confused, toothless comedy about a tiny fishing community whose residents lie, bluff, and bribe their way into a lucrative oil company contract.__The frequently funny "The Grand Seduction'' is a thoroughly pleasant way to pass a couple of hours.__If the film feels a bit clunky at times, it rarely slips into cliche.__The Grand Seduction feels made for Netflix's Watch Instantly feature - pleasant enough, but mostly forgotten with your next selection.__This is middlebrow comedy at its blandest.
The film is an obvious labor of love for all concerned, and the good times are infectious.__The uninitiated may not go for the all-too-convenient crime solving, melodramatic love triangle, and playful banter, but cultists will find all the show's pleasures intact.__Veronica herself is such a breath of fresh air as a strong female character: smart, secure, resourceful, loyal, funny and not the slightest bit chickish.__This isn't just a nostalgia trip. Almost a decade has passed, and the characters aren't just older, they've changed in recognizable and gratifying ways.__Somehow, miraculously, the Veronica Mars movie is definitely not bad. It's pretty damn good, actually.__Right now, the question is how did Veronica Mars turn out as a movie? It's a mixed bag. Too much time wasted on a whodunit that's more like a who-cares. No matter. Mars fans will have a blast.__Veronica Mars is a delightful piece of fan service - a supersized TV reunion episode expanded for viewing in movie theaters.__In the center, of course, is Bell, still right on target with the wisecracks and attitude that made "Mars" work.__It all seems like an overblown TV episode.__Veronica Mars is a great deal more than a bonus episode, but slightly less than a movie.__Ties up a lot of loose ends and opens up a new can of worms.__Luckily, the action picks up when the dialogue stalls, with startling car crashes, cat-and-mouse games and unexpected gunshots that make for a spellbinding climax.__Be careful what you wish for, and also what you buy into.__It's effective as a sequel to the television series and works just as well as a stand-alone film.__Everything feels forced, from Veronica's almost compulsive snappy patter to a class reunion that includes a sex tape and a brawl.__"Veronica Mars" isn't really a movie but another episode -- and not even a grand finale -- with all the familiar characters and in-jokes that viewers expect.__They're calling "Veronica Mars" a movie, but no matter which way you squint at it, it's a TV show.__The movie proves you can go home again. But it will take a better sequel to decide whether you want to.__Everything about the way the movie version of "Veronica Mars" came to pass is more intriguing than the movie itself.__Congratulations, loyalists. Veronica's return is everything you've hoped it would be. It's so much fun you may want to put a few bucks aside for a sequel.
Kidman and Firth are both excellent in their sadness and savagery, and Joffe builds tension far better than most of the horror movies available at your local Cineplex this Halloween weekend.__It's shallow, it's silly, it's pat. It's... forgettable.__Throbbing musical crescendos and flickery flashbacks abound but apart from some outlandish plot machinations, nothing here is good or bad enough to be memorable.__With luck, Kidman will erase this inept thriller from her memory as quickly as it leaves theaters.__It isn't Hitchcock, but it will do.__Filled with far too many contradictions and implausible situations.__Were it not for the participation of two A-list actors, Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth, Before I Go to Sleep would have been headed straight to video.__Kidman, in particular, takes honors for her smart, unshowy work, conveying desperation with her eyes and terror in the way she refuses to trust anyone with her real emotion.__It's just another forgettable genre film. If you don't figure it out within half an hour, you probably haven't been to a movie since 1999.__If the story is a smidge predictable, at least the movie is pleasingly old-fashioned and grown-up, with a '90s paranoid-thriller vibe.__If it weren't for the diligent performances of its stars, who inject some emotional depth into this bogus claptrap, "Before I Go to Sleep" would be an unwatchable, titter-inducing catastrophe.__Although "Before I Go to Sleep" is a handsomely made, often intriguingly twisty thriller, it feels like awfully familiar business.__[An] average thriller that's punctured with annoying plot holes.__Unfortunately, the film turns out to be not quite as twisty as promised: it's less a pretzel than it is a Cheez Curl.__At the moment "Before I Go To Sleep" looks like this year's grand-prize winner for Most Befuddling Narrative Structure.__"Before I Go to Sleep" is a bad dream. It's a wobbly psychological thriller with only a trace of thrills.__The premise is promising, but writer/director Rowan Joffe seems at a loss for how to handle the material; it all eventually, like Christine's memories, fades away.__A nifty premise, but other films have done this with more verve and imagination. The fine cast almost makes up for the ponderous tone.__Despite its intriguing premise, the film amounts to little more than tedious, cliched melodramatics.__Before I Go To Sleep turns a ludicrous premise into a fitfully suspenseful, consistently interesting exercise in audience manipulation.
The main question Rosewater grapples with is whether Stewart can hack it as a filmmaker. The answer: sort of?__Rosewater certainly has merit as an act of atonement on Stewart's part and a tribute to people like Bahari... In the end, however, the movie needs to stand on its own, apart from its noble intentions and the popularity of its writer-director.__The hard-focus clarity of the images (Bobby Bukowski did the cinematography) leads to an intimacy with anguish that passes into expressionism.__This is Jon Stewart's directorial debut; the talk show comedian has a handle on the material and conveys it clearly.__Rosewater ... has an urgency that's all about the storytelling smarts of its first-time writer-director.__Stewart does a credible job of maintaining the story's immediacy, but I must say I felt relieved that the film wasn't a masterpiece. If it was, we'd have more reason to fear Stewart will leave The Daily Show.__It's a movie made for people who prefer to take their politics while sitting on the couch.__Stewart's enthusiasm for his story and passion about injustice ring clear, but throughout what could have been a dreadfully somber film, he remembers to breathe.__A strong, striking political drama.__Stewart acquits himself solidly, though not thrillingly, as a beginning director ...__Stewart's wryly observant qualities as a TV star serve him well in his feature film debut.__What makes "Rosewater" different from similar entries in what might be called the Triumph of the Imprisoned Spirit genre is that the hero is hardly an ideologue, despite having sympathy for the Iranian reformers and the Green party.__While the film keeps telling us that Bahari survived his ordeal by freeing his mind from imprisonment and eventually outsmarting his rosewater-scented interrogator, we are told that he's doing so more than we're seeing it.__Mr. Stewart's interest in the material is obviously personal, but his movie transcends mere self-interest.__A finely wrought, powerful drama that tells the true story of an Iranian-born journalist's imprisonment and torture by the Islamic regime in Iran.__Stewart lets the truth roll out, the best he can, believing in the sanitizing effect of sunlight and the inevitable fate that awaits all despots.__With Rosewater, Stewart proves he can pull back from the satirical comedy and become a thoughtful, incisive and questioning filmmaker.__The result neither portrays the suffering of Bahari's incarceration adequately nor lampoons the absurdities of the situation.__"Rosewater" doesn't hector, nor does it giggle about the issue of press freedom. It's an impressive and important piece of storytelling.__For a first effort, Stewart hasn't done a bad job. There's just the nagging feeling with "Rosewater" that a better movie was possible.
Robespierre's direction of the many fine actors she assembled is assured, her sense of pacing nicely loose-limbed.__Despite a few too-cute moments, the movie is both smarter and more sympathetic than that glib shorthand.__Slate is adept with biting remarks and self-deprecation, and she balances Donna somewhere between flightiness and innocence.__Sorry, partisans, but there's nothing obvious about "Obvious Child."__Slate is too pretty a face and Robespierre is too limited a writer for Obvious Child to rise above conventional romantic plotting or to make its low comedy meaningfully transgressive.__A cross between a Woody Allen farce and a one-woman show by Sarah Silverman.__Robespierre and company deserve high praise for tackling a story with such a difficult subject at its heart, with a combination of grace, humour and courage.__"Obvious Child" enters territory rarely trod by romantic comedies - it's clear Donna's in no way ready to have a child - and does so with warmth and wit.__A foul-mouthed comedy with an immature heroine has treated a thorny issue with remarkable candor.__Virtue and vulgarity fight to a draw via a film that should put the vivacious Jenny Slate and director Gillian Robespierre on everyone's indie radar.__"Obvious Child" is being promoted as a groundbreaking topical comedy about abortion. But it's less than that. And more. And, basically, not.__A movie that feels risky and forgiving and, despite its traditional rom-com contours, refreshingly new.__What it lacks is dramatic interest. There's no zing in it.__The heroine can't seem to come up with any material that doesn't involve bodily functions; she never goes near the subject of motherhood, which proves that the filmmakers are scared to death of their own story.__Moment to moment, you believe what's happening in Robespierre's film, which is funny and rueful in roughly equal measure without being despairing in the slightest.__It's a well-written rom-com with rascally charm, a modest story of an awkward Brooklyn girl making a go of life.__The movie doesn't present itself as some kind of secular equivalent of a moral lesson. It's not callous or weepy or preachy - or self-consciously not those things. It's a naturally told story.__Whatever talent or care Robespierre has goes into guiding the actors toward real gentleness, including Slate, who spends the movie with big, untamed hair. Her affect is brazenly ungroomed.__The beauty of Obvious Child is that there's nothing obvious about it.__It's a small, modest film that doesn't act like it's groundbreaking. But it is.
This hedonistic japery is shot through with middle-aged melancholy and the fear of death.__If it's your cup of tea, you're likely to spill it from laughing so hard. Somebody send these two on another holiday.__It's that melancholy within each man that saves the film from disposability.__The Trip to Italy doesn't feel entirely new, but there's comfort in familiarity, too.__Where comedy provides the tonic in so many films, it's the hint of reality that pushes in at the edges and changes the pace here. These guys are funny. But they know their longer trip will continue once the last plate of pasta is empty.__If "The Trip to Italy" begins shakily, it ends with expansive bliss ...__If you laughed at Coogan and Brydon's (sometimes astonishing) mimicry in "The Trip," you'll smile again. If not, you probably won't go out of your way to find the sequel.__"The Trip to Italy" is like most vacations: a few bumps here and there, but over all too quickly.__The movie soon grows tedious; Coogan's irritation with his traveling partner has diminished significantly, and the laughs along with it.__As we watch, the thought keeps returning, over and over: Why watch these people? What's the point? Film anybody's trip to Italy, and it would be more interesting than this, or at least equally boring.__With Winterbottom's first-ever sequel, his "Trip" films now rival &#65279;Linklater's "Before" series in charting how a twosome evolves over time. Plus, they're bloody hilarious.__Ever been on a trip with absurdly witty people who constantly one-up each other, to the point that it's either hilarious or exhausting?__This is a sequel that, for a change, was worth making.__"The Trip to Italy" may not quite measure up to "The Godfather, Part II," the platinum standard for movie sequels, but it's very funny, and slightly serious, all the same.__If Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon were even 7 percent less amusing, "The Trip to Italy" would have no reason to exist, even with its casually gorgeous scenery and shattering close-ups of seafood pasta fresh out of the kitchen.__You come for the conversation, and in that, "The Trip to Italy" rarely disappoints.__I'd follow these guys "'round the horn" in a second. Maybe that's where they'll head next time.__Yes, these friends play rough and you wouldn't want to compete at their table, but through Winterbottom's funny and slyly serious film, you can experience their creativity from a seat nearby.__The funniest bits are when the mimicry and the insults converge.__The celebrity mimicry and the shouted jokes still can't conceal how stale around the edges the concept is getting.
Where is all this going, you ask? Good question.__It's stocked with cliches, but they're arranged in such weird ways that the end result is both predictable and certifiable. If only any of it actually went somewhere.__Connoisseurs of the most wonderfully terrible cinema need to run out and catch this one early and often.__"The Identical" is ultimately too schematically sentimental, even with Liotta playing against type, to have much of an impact.__Trading strictly in visual and narrative cliches, The Identical is so solemn and silly that at times you could swear it was a lampoon.__A jukebox musical that takes time revealing its goofy absurdity.__"The Identical" occupies a neglected niche as a family-friendly movie that isn't geared just toward kids. But living up to a legend is an uphill battle, and the movie doesn't ever reach those heights.__"The Identical" has grand ambitions, but they fall flat amid a muddled message and a strong whiff of righteousness.__Elvis Presley made some bad movies, but let's give the King his due: He never made anything as outright awful as "The Identical."__The cast is as scattershot as a moonshiner's raccoon hunt.__Elvis may have left the building, but a bland impersonator has made his way onto the big screen in a contrived twins-separated-at-birth movie.__The filmmakers use such a straight-laced and schmaltzy approach that "The Identical" might as well be a Hallmark TV movie.__The script is so determined to deliver an upbeat message of faith and love, it forgets to be interesting.__The music-heavy second half doesn't zip with much pizzazz, and even the film's many dips into song-and-dance fail to keep it moving along with anything resembling style. By its third act, things have flatlined.__[The Identical] feels like one of the biopic parodies from Mr. Show played completely straight.__Elvis slash fiction that could have been written by a spinster church organist.__Viewers will probably find themselves wishing there was a sense of personality on screen to match the eccentric passion that clearly went into putting the project together.__It's not very good, but it's certainly a curiosity.__Guys, next time you have the urge to write ultra-generic pop songs, inflict them on guests at your family reunion instead.__The Identical gets the job done adequately enough. This passably palatable film never hits any real high notes, however.
He's a crowd-pleaser reminiscent of Robin Williams, inserting funny sounds and vocal impersonations into nearly every line and alternating raunchy material with moments of unabashed sentimentality.__For the most part, Fluffy's material is just that - fluff, with a touch now and then of bile and bad taste.__"Fluffy" is a standard-issue comedy concert film far better suited to a 90-minute cable TV slot than the big screen.__At one point, the comic says that fans have asked him what he'll have to talk about if he keeps losing weight, to which Iglesias answers that he will always have stories to tell. To its credit, "The Fluffy Movie" leaves you wanting to hear more of them.__Iglesias makes his strongest impact when he sticks to material that is extremely personal.__Iglesias is a likeable presence, and his fluid delivery, complete with spot-on accents and sound effects, is consistently engaging.__Mr. Iglesias's style in his first theatrical concert film is grounded in a down-to-earth warmth and a nimble mimicry that bolsters even routine subject matter.__Like much of Iglesias' material, the movie almost gets in your face before flashing a friendly smile and forgettably floating away.__It's not much of a movie. There's no particular reason to watch this in a theater rather than on television.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Poitras' movie works even better as a horror picture -- perfect for Halloween week.__This thoughtful film is designed with taste.__The message of the movie is as clear as Siberian ice: Whether you're a Tea Partier, an Occupier or just an ordinary Joe, you might be the next citizen who's stranded in limbo.__Filmmaker Laura Poitras paints a frankly terrifying picture of the loss of liberty involved in the widespread government gathering of the communication done by ordinary Joes on a daily basis.__Citizenfour argues that when we lose our personal privacy, we also lose our liberty, because fear overcomes our freedom of speech.__Citizenfour plays like a thriller as it chronicles a complex and vitally important chapter in our history.__The documentary of the year may also be its most hair-raising thriller.__So explosive, it's one of the most riveting films you'll see this year.__This isn't just a documentary -- this is history.__This documentary offers plenty of fuel for a long, ongoing debate.__This is a complicated story, but it's efficiently laid out by Poitras in this smartly edited project.__If you think Snowden is a traitor, you should probably see it. If you think he's a hero, you should probably see it. If you haven't made up your mind - well, you get the idea.__A first-hand, up-close account of Snowden that allows us to meet and judge the man for ourselves.__The film works, whatever your ethical stance on Snowden, because it's more procedural than polemic.__Snowden has been called a traitor, but here he comes off as a decent man trying to do the right thing, if however awkwardly (or illegally).__It's hard to overstate the film's achievement.__Laura Poitras may be guilty of taking Snowden at face value, but she succeeds brilliantly in evoking a shadow villain intent on world domination. Big Brother is back, baby, and he's gone digital.__As we watch the T-shirted Snowden, sitting on his messy hotel bed with his little laptop, set the stage for what is to come, the vast disjunction between these mundane surroundings and his imminent, world-shattering revelations is almost comical.__[It serves as a] chance for Poitras to reorganize her Pulitzer Prize-winning story in her own medium and cinema verite style. It mostly works.__There are not a lot of moments in documentary cinema that equal "Citizenfour."
Like so many filmmakers before him, Levasseur doesn't seem to grasp that in the horror genre, less can be more.__If you're looking for cheap scares and have 90 minutes to kill, you could do worse than The Pyramid. But not a lot worse.__The air inside the pyramid isn't the only thing that's stale in this ludicrous yet mildly likable horror film.__A stinker in every sense.__"The Pyramid," despite an unpretentious matinee vibe, is mostly interesting in seeing how little light can be on screen before a bare minimum of suspense and coherence dissipates. There is, truly, not much to see in this movie.__It's hard to know what's worse, the under-lit "found footage" from the documentary team or the wretched dialogue.__Some things were never meant to be uncovered. Some movies, too.__These B-movie touches aren't especially scary, and the characters are too paralyzed with fear to have much fun with the silliness.__This enjoyable-despite-itself horror flick has precisely nothing new to offer - with the arguable exception of a monster in a miniskirt, which may be a first.__Levasseur plants and executes the pic's exclamation-point scares with grinning, squelching gusto. It matters little that most of the jolts have been lifted from previous movies ...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
There's a sense that The Good Lie wants to say something profound but the message is as muddled as its delineation of history is.__The main characters are played by actual refugees-two of whom were child soldiers-and their uninflected, authoritative performances compensate for the feel-good simplifications of Margaret Nagle's script.__A well-told tale that illuminates the experiences of the 20,000 "lost boys" (and girls) of Sudan, with such grace, insight and humor, it can be forgiven a few simplifying liberties taken in the name of moving the narrative along.__If a moviegoer can't cry for the great tragedy of these Sudanese children, and be touched by their small victories, then who on earth deserves our tears and cheers?__It's often earnest to a fault and fearful of its deeper, darker implications. Still, you won't leave The Good Lie unmoved. Its heart really is in the right place,__Director Philippe Felardeau finds some extraordinary landscapes here. And his camera also lingers over his characters' faces, striking maps of their pain, their hunger, their loss.__"The Good Lie" may be a little too soft. But it largely avoids mawkish sentimentality and casts a glow that is increasingly absent nowadays from films depicting international strife.__The Good Lie honestly earns its laughter and tears, even if it has to do so by way of some Hollywood window dressing.__The pieces don't always fit together as neatly as you might wish, but if you let it, "The Good Lie's" heartwarming soul will win you over.__A big, eager puppy of an issue movie that plants its paws on your chest and licks away at your cheek in eager expectation of praise.__The political becomes personal, eye-opening and moving in The Good Lie.__This is very much a mainstream movie meant to shine a light on the plight of people who were ignored for too long. For that reason alone, it's well worth seeing.__In substance as well as style, "The Good Lie" amounts to two films joined together; the first is very good, the second good enough.__There are lessons to be learned here. And ultimately the heart of "The Good Lie" is in the right place.__In a bait-and-switch worthy of its title, "The Good Lie" may lure in viewers eager to see a Reese Witherspoon movie, but they'll fall in love with something else entirely.__Most of the time, Hollywood applies so much energy to warming your heart, the excess energy turns your brain to mush. The Good Lie works as well as it does precisely because of an intelligence, humanity and restraint we rarely see in Hollywood films.__It's a sappy, but occasionally sensitive, coming-to-America story that hits all of the familiar beats. It has one very big problem, though, and she's played by Reese Witherspoon.__I never thought I'd be so happy to see so little of Reese Witherspoon in a Reese Witherspoon movie.__A vital project that commands attention and pays off in heart and soul.__A compelling film - occasionally a bit too earnest, perhaps, or overly broad in its humor, but often deeply moving.
If The Raid 2: Berandal doesn't end up as the most violent movie to hit screens in 2014, it won't be for lack of trying.__Two and-a-half hours may seem like a lot for an Indonesian crime saga, but "The Raid 2" has a sweeping scope that justifies its running time. And it will knock you out.__A brilliant, dazzling, and devastating 21/2-hour ballet of brutality that's more ordeal than entertainment ...__For those of us who believe the prime directive of action pictures is that such movies ought to, by gawd, move , Gareth Evans is our new patron saint.__At once messy and adrenalizing ...__A very talented, very long piece of ultra-violence about a fleet-footed undercover cop who wreaks havoc on the criminal hierarchy of Jakarta.__By opening the action up to the entire city for the sequel, there's less claustrophobia but also less excitement.__Every time you think The Raid 2 can't possibly top itself, writer-director Gareth Evans goes "Oh, yeah? Watch THIS."__The film never stints on kinetic, carefully choreographed mayhem, from a mud-drenched prison-yard riot to a next-level car chase that sets a new standard for automotive assault and battery.__The plot is murky, the acting is melodramatic and the movie is way too long, but the target audience will salivate over the inventively choreographed set-pieces ...__Certainly, The Raid 2, a glorious head-butt of a movie, is not for the squeamish...but for those who prefer some slam in their cinema, it delivers.__This is an action junkie's fix and it literally pulls no punches.__Make no mistake. If what you're after is insane, mind-bogglingly violent martial arts action, The Raid 2 is quite possibly the ultimate.__This is an absurdly violent film, but it's too in love with the physical genius of its actors to really feel sadistic.__The story is convoluted without being profound, and although there are some strong secondary performances, Uwais is interesting only when in motion.__Crystal clear, vibrant and brutally violent.__As you might guess, this is not a film for everyone's taste. But for fans of the martial arts genre, Evans has created a scintillating, if sometimes imperfect, new chapter.__Neither its undercover drama nor its two-and-a-half-hour length bog down the bracing, and numerous, fight fests.__Just when you think the movie has gotten as wonderfully, violently over-the-top as possible, it manages to keep upping the ante until its exhausting climax. It leaves you drained, but not enervated.__The Raid 2 lets its warriors rip for two and a half thrilling hours. With the precision of dance and the punch of a KO champion, [director Gavin] Evans keeps the action coming like nobody's business.
Minds will be blown to the four winds. And - fair warning - a percentage of American ticket buyers may find themselves exasperated and/or exiting early.__It's admirable that Johansson should be so willing to go off the Hollywood grid, but the truth is, "Under the Skin" would have been a lot better if it wasn't so excruciatingly arty.__All this is initially fascinating, and then progressively less so.__Most of Under the Skin operates on an almost subconscious level. The truth is out there in Glazer's screenplay, which he co-wrote with Walter Campbell, but it's intuitive rather than didactic.__One of the most polarizing movies in recent years.__A direct descendant of Nicolas Roeg's classic "The Man Who Fell to Earth," "Under the Skin" is the kind of movie people will be talking about, and dissecting and puzzling over, for years.__Visually stunning but virtually indecipherable ...__Under the Skin definitely gets under your skin.__The story is at once simple and impenetrable. Visually it is arresting, when it isn't murky, and the droning, atonal soundtrack is as perfect for the film as it is annoying.__This arty sci-fi thriller, adapted from a 2000 novel by Michael Faber, raises far more questions than it answers, yet that enigmatic quality is central to its appeal.__"Under the Skin" clearly does not intend to telegraph its meaning, but meaning may not be the movie's strong suit.__Once "Under the Skin" reaches its surprisingly affecting conclusion, it feels less like a cinematic novel than a well-executed short story.__"Under the Skin" begins to take on the feel of tragedy; of a creature trapped, like that baby, somewhere it cannot survive.__The movie's a cinematic Rubik's Cube that snaps together surprisingly easily, yet whose larger meanings remain tantalizingly out of reach.__"Under the Skin" is original to the highest degree. Is it a great film? I'm not convinced. Are there moments of greatness in it? Quite a few.__This becomes quite dull, even sleep-inducing, especially considering the movie's overall cast of slow-moving gloom.__It's as existential as a sci-fi/horror film can possibly be. It requires that the viewer slip into a meditative mood and remain there for more than 90 minutes.__Pondering the questions, reveling in the mysteries - that's what matters. And I haven't even said the words naked Scarlett Johansson yet.__I was willing to watch more to discover what was underneath the surface. Once I found out, I was frozen in place, and then Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Glazer had their way with me.__At times the film is right on the border between mesmerizing and narcotizing, but it casts an otherworldly spell.
Kill the Messenger does a credible if not dazzling job. In fact, the movie is a lot like the reporting that inspired it: a good introduction to a diabolically tangled tale.__Cliches and obviousness litter the movie.__It's oversold and under-reported. But Kill the Messenger flies high on Jeremy Renner's all-stops-out performance as 1990s-era journalist Gary Webb. Flaws aside, the film inspires a moral outrage that feels disconcertingly timely.__A resonant journalistic cautionary tale gets packaged as a hokey thriller in Kill the Messenger, a movie with a message that isn't nearly as urgent as it needs to be.__Drugs, government, truths, mustaches. "Kill the Messenger" is an admirable journalism thriller that takes on a lot of big subjects.__If this movie is any guide, Webb's later years deserve a film of their own. We ought to know more about this fascinating character. And we ought to see more of the fully engaged actor playing him.__Kill the Messenger does a fine job of dramatizing Webb's reporting. The suspense reminds one of All the President's Men, if the structure and writing pale in comparison.__A serious, interesting film about a very simple concept: The Truth. And how very complicated that can sometimes become.__Jeremy Renner hasn't been this good since The Hurt Locker (although most of his output since then has been in popcorn movies - hey, the guy needs to make a living).__The film falters as the story swells and churns ...__It's an engrossing portrait not only of government intrigue and crusading after the truth, but of media and their tangled motivations.__[Renner] inhabits the character completely, digging into the role with the same won't-let-go fierceness Webb himself displayed when newsworthy information came his way.__If the pacing sags a little, and the scale is more modest than the 60 Minutes scandal at the heart of The Insider, Kill the Messenger is still crisp, smart and gutsy.__The film tells the story from Webb's point of view without exonerating him. In fact, we never learn enough about just what was and wasn't true, or how far Webb stretched the truth.__If the screenplay to "Kill the Messenger" were a news story, any capable copydesk would have kicked it back to the reporter-not for a shortage of facts, but a lack of dramatic soul.__"Kill the Messenger" achieves the jittery tension of "The Insider," if not quite the righteous fervor of "All the President's Men."__Director Michael Cuesta, a veteran of HBO's Homeland, imparts enough paranoid-thriller ambience to propel the complex story.__To his credit, Cuesta is interested not only in the darkest side of democracy, but in how Webb's fiery work impacts his personal life.__Kill the Messenger is a David-and-Goliath story where truth is the slingshot - a fragile weapon that needs to score a fatal hit before the big guy gets mad.__Kill the Messenger made me so angry over the apparent injustice done to its journalist hero, Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner), that I found it hard to remain in my seat.
Parts of The Homesman are a slog to sit through, but the movie ends on a note of absurd comedy that also breaks your heart, suggesting that some people, no matter the circumstances, are incapable of change.__If only things had started out on more solid ground and headed toward some sort of resolution. If only.__The film has more surprising turns than a honeycomb has bees. Absurdity and calamity collide without warning.__Swank, an Oscar winner for "Boys Don't Cry" and "Million Dollar Baby," is outstanding, getting to the essence of Mary Bee's pride and pain. And in the showier role, Jones impressively peels away layers of rambunctiousness to reveal George's humanity.__Swank and Streep are big stars with famous faces, and yet disappear into their roles; these characters convey both quiet strength and gentle kindness.__As the protagonists near their final destination, The Homesman offers a critique of civilization that's almost as pessimistic as its critique of frontier life, suggesting that in every corner of America there have always been more losers than winners.__It's as stubbornly and cantankerously eccentric as both its wagon drivers, not to mention driven to blaze its own trail through the narrative and mythological landscape of America's defining story form.__At a certain point, The Homesman will take you by surprise. By the end ... it will take your heart.__The Homesman is a western hard and true, one that probably comes closer to depicting the hardships of frontier life than any number of more conventional oaters.__For a movie headlined by two Oscar-winning Hollywood stars - and directed and co-written by one of them - "The Homesman" is awfully close to outsider art.__Wanders along the lonesome trail, then heads off into the underbrush.__Some recent interviews with Jones paint him as a bit of a curmudgeon. But he's right to push back against being put into a box. "The Homesman" succeeds mainly because it and he don't neatly fit into one.__Few will regret having seen "The Homesman," and yet it's not exactly an enjoyable experience.__Right or wrong, "The Homesman" belongs to Jones and Swank, and for Western aficionados it's worth seeing.__A film that looks at first glance like a conventional Western but goes to unusual places.__While the film is bathed in a beautiful magic-hour glow courtesy of cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Jones' journey doesn't quite take off.__The melancholic balance isn't always quite right and the momentum wanes when it should be gaining.__I was impressed with how Jones's uncomfortable mixing of tones in the first half of the film gave way to something more elegiac and evocative by the end.__"Tommy Lee Jones' riveting Western is bleak and very nearly misanthropic, but it's also passionate, earthy, unpredictable, sensitive, and gloriously distinct."__The development probably works in Glendon Swarthout's novel of the same name, where Swank is nowhere in sight. But not in the theater. You're tempted to give up on the movie because it feels as if the movie has given up on her.
Tugging shamelessly yet persuasively on the heartstrings, "Ode to My Father" is an epic South Korean melodrama capturing more than half a century of recent history through the eyes of an everyman shopkeeper.__"Ode to My Father" may have slain them in South Korea, but its packaged pain and bullet-point structure are likely to leave Western audiences cold.__Everything is lathered with a syrupy, string-laden musical score designed to gnaw at a viewer's tear ducts. It's about as subtle as having an off-screen narrator yell "Start crying!" before big scenes, and probably as effective.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
'Love is Strange' takes something so right and leaves it hanging all wrong.__"Love Is Strange" is a testament to love, not in an overly sentimental way, but in a realistic way.__"Love is Strange" boasts an abundance of patience and kindness - but not much of a pulse.__Love Is Strange is drab-looking and has its longueurs, but it's emotionally very full.__I can't say enough about how smart and clear-eyed it is. And moving: I'm wiping tears off my keyboard as I type this.__This is not a strident film; it's about subtle performances.__An unforgettable portrait, set to a dazzling soundtrack of Chopin piano pieces, of the sense of loss we all feel when we are obliged to move into unfamiliar and uncomfortable surroundings.__"Love Is Strange" is beautifully acted and bittersweet. It's a gentle reminder that modern love, like a houseplant, needs sunlight, space and attention to grow.__A film about learning, and changing, and learning to change.__Sachs tells the story with artful economy - one late, crucial plot point happens without our seeing it - and ends it with an achingly lovely image, caught in golden sunlight.__What lends it spirit is the performances, both major and minor, and Sachs's determination to dramatize same-sex love not as groundbreaking, but as securely rooted -- rent control and all -- in common ground.__Sometimes, love can feel like hate or annoyance - it is, as the title states, strange. But sometimes, more often than not, it can be a wonderful thing.__"Love Is Strange" is one of those lovely little movies that starts out being about a handful of people and ends up being about all of us.__The movie, which feels a bit like a mashup of Woody Allen and Mike Leigh, succeeds on its simple story and its lead actors.__The strangest thing about "Love Is Strange" is how completely un-strange it is, from its familiar family dynamics to its exquisite honesty and compassion.__Beautifully realized in Sachs's sensitive characterization are the pain of separation and the despair of becoming a burden on the next generation.__See "Love Is Strange" for its sensitivity and understated jokes, but mainly for Lithgow and Molina's expertly modulated work, which pulls the movie back when it threatens to stray into melodrama or heavy-handedness.__Many, I suspect, will be moved to tears by "Love Is Strange," which Sachs earns the hard way: not by amping up the dramatic situations, but by grace notes and quiet spells cast by all the right actors.__The living-apart scenario is contrived -- there was no way for these men to share a space somewhere? -- but the two actors are so good that it doesn't much matter.__Lithgow, with his modulated flamboyance, and Molina, with his sad-eyed realism, are perfect individually and as a team. But the movie tends to drift away from an audience, because it's all sensibility, no sense.
Before long the movie -- as neatly constructed as it is -- isn't really behaving like a movie, but more like life, as it's lived by a fractious pair of empty nesters who find themselves at a crossroads.__Once the characters start explaining the sources of their unhappiness, the drama becomes less compelling, largely because their problems seem far from insurmountable.__By its ambiguous yet hopeful end, we're at one with Nick and Meg: Sometimes, you just have to dance. Somehow, you go on.__[It] lacks a solid plot or even much structure -- yet it works beautifully.__Not exactly a breezy getaway, the film visits the sites, and drops down on rougher terrain, too.__This extra-dry mix of drama and comedy is supposed to reflect the complexities of real life; but as a movie, it's so schematic and schizoid, it leaves us scratching our berets.__Wisely, director Roger Michell ("Notting Hill") does not burden Hanif Kureishi's literate, witty and emotionally nuanced script and the impeccable performances with an attempt at personal style.__Director Roger Michell ("Notting Hill") has the good sense to step back and let Broadbent and Duncan work their magic on Hanif Kureishi's script. They don't disappoint.__An alternately prickly and knowing tone poem to desire and disappointment whose light touch belies far deeper, darker human understandings.__Even the redoubtable Broadbent succumbs to unchecked pathos and self-loathing. Only Duncan's gorgeous suppleness and alertness keep Meg from seeming cruel and overly acidic.__A nuanced romance for grown-ups.__Sad, sweet, dark, funny and possibly even redemptive.__"Le Week-End" is a ruefully funny look at a long-term marriage.__This film doesn't feel obliged to pick a winner or lob easy answers; it aims to observe, with humor and humanity, with penetration and without oversimplifying.__Don't run away with the idea that this is a film for your parents. There is no reason why people under 40 or pushing 30 shouldn't see it.__It's easy to tire (if not despair) of them, but both lead actors are in fine sparring form, and the story is rescued and revived, just in time, by a delectable cameo from Jeff Goldblum.__A long slog of marital dysfunction.__"Le Week-End" is a sour and misanthropic film masquerading as an honest and sensitive romance.__Since it's Broadbent, Duncan and Goldblum doing the skipping, trashing and mimicking, their second adolescence is great fun to watch.__All sorts of talent has been chucked away here by the director's heavy touch and the script's naked contrivance.
We don't make movies in America like Gloria, so we have to import them. I wish we'd import more -- and make a few, as well.__Whether you appreciate Gloria as a portrait of a vital woman, muddling through life's middle chapters, or as an allegory of Chilean resilience, the message is the same: Let's face the music and dance.__Chilean actress Paulina Garcia's performance in "Gloria" is simply flabbergasting.__Not quite a comedy and not quite a drama, this Chilean film looks at middle age from a refreshingly even-handed perspective, not a wacky or tragic one.__The film belongs to Garcia, who is in literally every shot. Wafting over Garcia's face at different moments are contentment, frustration, loneliness, disappointment, happiness.__"Gloria" is that rare work, a truly adult film. By its end, you want to cheer the simple act of living.__By the end, we dance with her, living in the moment as she does, not looking ahead to life's next turn.__This is a driven, indelible character -- like the women Gena Rowlands played for John Cassavetes -- and you fear her going over the edge not least because you suspect you'd follow her.__Audiences intuitively search for someone to root for in a film, and Garcia's Gloria, who's in practically every frame of the movie, fits that bill perfectly.__The movie lets you make up your own mind about this vivacious woman, who is doing her best not to surrender to her inner loneliness.__Gloria, spare and keenly observed, plays like a short story - there is no sweeping narrative arc, no momentous triumph or calamity.__Hitchcock once said that other directors made slices of life; he made pieces of cake. Lelio's feat is that he's made a slice of life that's a piece of cake, too.__For the most part, "Gloria" is a day brightener of a character study about finding someone new and making the same old mistakes.__"Gloria," a charmer from Chile, is a character portrait of a woman the movies rarely notice: Divorced, hovering around 60, not especially interested in self-pity.__The message, if one needs to look for one, is that the course of romance is no smoother at 50 than it is at 15, when heedlessness is an advantage to plunging into love.__"Gloria" is a character study, one that's pitiful in the compassionate sense of the word.__Were it not for Garcia's performance, Gloria might have turned into a bedraggled bore. Fortunately, there's always something to look at whenever she is on screen, which is most of the time. She becomes something she never intended to be - a heroine.__It's rife with disappointment and humiliation. But bleakness does not preclude buoyancy. It still manages to leave you with the urge to dance.__With someone else in the central role, "Gloria" might have been cloyingly sentimental or downright maudlin. With Ms. Garcia on hand, it's a mostly convincing celebration of unquenchable energy.__Chilean director Sebastian Lelio's near-perfect film about the very imperfect world of a divorced woman of a certain age.
The physical look of the movie is a revelation of a lost past.__The film is an achievement. Its complex reckoning of moral decency deserves a bigger audience.__Gray's movie is an almost flawlessly articulated example of the kind of thing we like to say they just don't make any more: serious, adult, character-driven and impassioned.__At times, Khondji's golden portraiture can make the characters seem encased in amber. But there's a tremendous payoff for the patient.__An astonishingly beautiful, irresistibly grim movie ...__This is Gray's most mature work, and the picture raises Cotillard to a select pantheon.__It's a little freaky to watch Phoenix go at it, a smooth-talking beguiler who suddenly turns stumblebum. But there's nothing freakish about Cotillard.__It's the stuff of melodrama, elevated by Gray's sure hand and made more by Phoenix and Cotillard, lovers and haters and something beyond.__"The Immigrant" is one of those rare, strikingly beautiful film experiences that transport you to another world.__Steeped in period atmosphere, "The Immigrant" tells the story of one woman's struggle, and it is a struggle indeed, to find her way in a new country.__Gray, despite the rough edges, manages to meld decades of melodrama into a film that is at once simple and complex, morally black-and-white and psychologically ambiguous.__Gray directs this handsome and evocative film with emotional restraint, making its archetypal title character a living individual whose moral journey is never simple.__Its portrait of early 20th-century New York, a melting pot on a relentless simmer, feels wrenchingly real.__Beautifully shot (by Darius Khondji), designed, and performed, this may well be Gray's masterpiece.__From the Caruso serenade for the new arrivals at Ellis Island to the discordant reality on the other side of the golden door, "The Immigrant" has a ringing message: Succeeding in America is a dream act.__The Immigrant is the fourth collaboration between Gray and Phoenix, and it's their most fruitful to date.__From Ellis Island to Central Park to middle-class Brooklyn to the crowded streets of the Lower East Side, Gray delivers a gritty, muted portrait of Roaring '20s New York, photographed in monochrome tones by master cinematographer Darius Khondji.__The movie earns its dissonances. It's richer than anything onscreen right now.__Gray and his cinematographer Darius Khondji and production designer Happy Massee have done a magnificent job of re-creating this Lower East Side melting pot -- the best I've seen since the De Niro flashbacks in The Godfather II.__Call it a novelistic film, if you must. But know that it is a cinematic film, too. And above all - a James Gray one.
Even vampires get the blues.__This is a film that finds horror not in the extreme, but in the mundane. That alone makes it a worthwhile entry in a genre that it both inhabits and rises above.__Somehow it's all very entertaining and weird and fitting, with Detroit looking like a place any vampire would be happy to be.__You don't so much watch this movie as slink into it, joining an unlikely pair of lovers and enjoying their slouchy elegance.__"Only Lovers Left Alive" breathes new and intriguing life into the vampire genre.__Only Lovers is so fluidly edited and thinly plotted that it feels almost off-hand; yet, it's also made with great care, beautifully lit and set-designed to an eyelash.__Swinton, her hair white and long and her eyes tired and kind, and Hiddleston, moody and resigned, are wonderful - delivering their lines with the dry sighs of a desert breeze.__Languorous, droll and ultimately affecting.__In "Only Lovers Left Alive," writer-director Jim Jarmusch turns one of his silliest notions into one of the more affecting movies of his career.__Maybe it was to be expected that the vampire saga "Only Lovers Left Alive" has a sluggish pulse.__No one here gets out alive in Jim Jarmusch's cool new vampire romance ...__Rarely has Jarmusch's style been so inherently suited to his content. Stillness and silence, the cardinal virtues of his method, have never been so pertinent as in the lives of the undead.__Jim Jarmusch stocks his latest low-key indie with more than his usual characters in low-velocity drift.__This is a weak entry in the filmmaker's canon, a film that continues Jarmusch's rebellion against narrative while offering nothing in its place.__The movie is steeped in a world-weariness that flatters a certain kind of know-it-all. Swinton and Hiddleston, looking like twins, take disaffection to the moon. Not since Weekend at Bernie's have two actors done more to promote the cause of corpses.__it's also one of [Jarmusch's] most visually expressive films, playing out amid ravishing nocturnal imagery that fits perfectly with the dark romantic tone.__Has undoubted panache, and wit to spare, especially when Swinton is in the frame.__A vampire flick as only Jim Jarmusch would ever conceive it, languidly poetic, worldweary and crammed with hipster in-jokes.__Hiddleston is appropriately soggy in a Byronic kind of way, and Swinton, in a platinum-blond wig, gives the ultimate Tilda Swinton performance as a poetically famished vampiress.__The movie has its longeurs, but once you get on its wavelength it's hard to resist.
Nice as it would be to herald Tusk as a return to Smith's bold early period, the movie has a lurching tone and an airless atmosphere.__If Kevin Smith was stoned when he thought up his excellent walrusian nightmare, then marijuana is the best creative medicine.__"Excess" is Smith's middle name, so the show goes on . . . and on.__Tusk is not a particularly good movie, but the vivid anxiety dream at its heart makes it one of the most personal films this writer-director has ever made.__Tusk is an overextended, tonally incoherent joke that would make viewers squirm even if it didn't involve a bloody and demented medical experiment.__If you're a Kevin Smith junkie, as I am, you'll appreciate the verbal pinwheels he spins around the horror genre in Tusk.__A schizoid horror comedy with an identity crisis, shifting uncomfortably between shocking body horror and puerile Jackass-level cringe humor.__Most filmmakers start by making movies with their friends, just for their friends. Kevin Smith is the only filmmaker who seems to want to end that way.__This tonal mishmash is a misfire of literally gross proportions.__Smith seems to have been more charged up by the (profoundly ridiculous) ideas behind his movie than in making them work.__Kevin Smith, of "Clerks," delivers a weird in-joke inspired by one of his podcasts. You probably had to be there.__You can imagine Mr. Smith and his collaborators rolling in the aisles at their own preposterousness. If you can find your inner 16-year-old, you might just join them.__Take The Human Centipede and sprinkle liberally with the old Bob and Doug McKenzie sketches from SCTV and the result is Tusk, Kevin Smith's underbaked horror-comedy hybrid.__It has a game cast, it's watchable, fun, sick, sad and has to be seen to be believed.__"Tusk" seems to harbor no grander ambitions than to create a gross-out gag.__Kevin Smith's "Tusk" is an odd animal indeed, a movie that morphs early from stoner comedy to stoner horror flick and then, as if stoned, declines to evolve any further.__This is a movie worth seeing.__You don't feel like you wasted your time with "Tusk." But that's the best compliment you can probably give a film like this.__Good trash or stupid trash? I'd say roughly half and half.__Like many movies made by Kevin Smith, the director of "Clerks" and "Cop Out," his gothic horror comedy "Tusk" is alternately amusing, appalling and frustrating. It's also unique.
"Tim's Vermeer" is about many things - art history, technology, painting technique, beauty - but ultimately it's a beguiling study of fascination.__We should never forget that Penn and Teller are professional bamboozlers, and their attempt to re-frame the definition of genius might be nothing but smoke and mirrors.__Unexpectedly dazzling.__Tim's Vermeer is film as forensics, bringing math and science to bear to solve an art-world mystery.__"Tim's Vermeer" is a movie for people who like to think, who like to ponder the big questions surrounding art and the act of creation.__Mostly it is fascinating and compelling.__You might think that following this insanely ambitious DIY project would be like watching paint dry. Wrong.__Some movies are great because of their artistry; "Tim's Vermeer" achieves greatness - OK, semi-greatness - by placing the act of artistic creation itself under a microscope.__"Tim's Vermeer" makes a convincing case that Vermeer could have painted the way Jenison says he did. It also makes a pretty powerful ancillary point: that some people are both geniuses and geeks.__"Tim's Vermeer" is a diverting 80-minute account of one man's mission to explore the Vermeer optics theory in detail.__As mechanical as the procedure it depicts.__Art purists can relax since [inventor Tim] Jenison, a video wiz with little talent for painting, never really challenges Vermeer's genius for conception and composition. Technology is the thing at issue here.__Teller, the quiet half of the iconoclastic magic act Penn and Teller, crafts a captivating documentary portrait of the artist as a tinkerer.__Shooting in unattractive, hard-edge digital, Teller condenses Mr. Jenison's years-long pursuit into 80 glib, alternately diverting, exasperating and tedious minutes.__A fascinating documentary that poses a compelling aesthetic query: did 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer use optical devices to achieve his gorgeously photo-realistic, light-filled artwork?__"Tim's Vermeer," a fascinating documentary by the comic magicians Penn & Teller, has a way of arousing passionate feelings while provoking fresh ideas about the porous border between technology and art.__The film - an ode to craftsmanship - establishes without a doubt that many of the traits we reserve for other fields - dedication, ingenuity - are also inherent to the artistic process. Ta-da.__A captivating look at a high-tech inventor who presumes to replicate the work of a great painter.__An exquisitely fun documentary that hits on a profound aesthetic question, one first posed in 2001 by David Hockney: Did the 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer use optical devices to achieve his visual poetics of light?__A fascinating new documentary about art, obsessions, ideas and answers.
A voice-over narrator supplies some of Yogananda's more inspired passages, but the affected tone makes it all sound rather silly.__If you want to understand yoga as something beyond a workout exercise, this spiritual documentary could be a fine start.__Those looking for further enlightenment might want to pass on the feel-good cinematic hagiography known as "Awake: The Life of Yogananda."__Unfortunately, while the swami taught his disciples to explore the depths of their very souls, the film barely scratches the surface of his life and teachings.__Yogananda's story is a fascinating one. And although the documentary will likely attract a discrete group, it has the potential for broader appeal.__Fittingly enlightening, "Awake: The Life of Yogananda" is a vivid, elegantly assembled portrait of the savvy guru with the cherubic face and penetrating gaze who brought meditation to the West.__A film that works both for followers and for those interested in knowing what yoga is truly about. Hint: It's not about six-pack abs.__The film's storytelling is straightforward, almost standard-issue, but the story itself is compelling, as is the testimony of devotees.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Fixating on the fat rolls of underprivileged kids without mentioning class, the film is a more polished version of the greasy tale Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me told from the inside out.__It's a decent summary of the issue, taking square aim at corporations and politicians who have made it easy for the citizenry to stuff its collective face with junk food and, even more damaging, sugar.__Director Stephanie Soechtig gathers activists, doctors, kids, lobbyists, parents, politicians, reporters and teachers -- all with different stakes.__Expose against America's nutritional war on itself is informative, passionate, slightly regurgitated.__Thumbnail portraits of morbidly obese kids introduce a plaintive note to the argument, especially since, as the documentary notes, many school cafeterias are now indistinguishable from fast-food joints.__"Fed Up" gets to feeling like a special nightly news report. But as news reports go, it is an especially thorough and well-produced one, taking an in-depth look at America's worsening obesity epidemic and pointing fingers at culprits__The effect is stark, disturbing and inspirational, if you are willing to listen.__You won't look at grocery store aisles the same way after you've seen Fed Up.__You don't want to be downing Raisinets while watching this film.__Toggling between profiles of kids struggling with their weight and a wider look at the evolution of processed foods, "Fed Up" presents a pretty watertight case that there's something deeply wrong with the way we eat.__Even if you dispute the facts, one thing is clear: As a nation, we are fat, and getting fatter.__Stephanie Soechtig's attack on Big Food for sweetening us to death goes down like a tart, stiff drink.__Before "Fed Up," no movie had ever sent me hurrying to my refrigerator to read food labels - but there's always a first time.__Fed Up will change the way you look at junk food. Or at least the companies that peddle it.__A compelling wake-up call in the form of a feature-length documentary.__As a screed, it builds a credible, engaging argument, presenting evidence, statistics, talking-head testimony, whimsical charts, poignant personal stories, and animated illustrations of digestive processes to make its case.__A very good advocacy documentary directed by Stephanie Soechtig and narrated by Katie Couric.__Fed Up, unbothered by its often crude mode of attack, is definitely mad as hell. And its muckraking spirit, an anomaly in the age of giving in, is inspiring.__"Fed Up" isn't so much a warning to the ignorant shopper or a tip for the unimaginative chef as it is a rallying cry. It succeeds in firing up the choir. Whether it will convert the complacent is an open question.__It pulls no punches in its informed outrage against the food industry, zeroing in on the rampant use of sugar and its many multisyllabic variations.
Every time one of her photos flashes on the screen, the woman's genius is undeniable.__A film that leaves a large part of its subject's mystery gratifyingly intact.__The holes in the story are papered over with such beautiful photographs that few viewers could complain.__This is an amazing tale, and Maloof has labored mightily to flesh it out. He's almost as odd as Maier was.__Through dogged research and interviews with the (now-grown) children Maier cared for, along with their parents (including Phil Donahue), a profile emerges, and it's fascinating.__Finding Vivian Maier is a find in more ways than one.__The film functions best as an introduction to her work, which is what matters, and an invitation to see more of it, which is highly recommended.__Maier's work, interspersed throughout the film, lets us hear her voice: an array of faces gazing at us, meeting her camera, creating a tiny moment in time.__This may be the most pleasurable 83 minutes you will spend in a theater this year.__More connect-the-dots detective thriller than traditional doc, John Maloof and Charlie Siskel's revelatory riddle of a film unmasks a brilliant photographer who hid in plain sight for decades__Directors John Maloof and Charlie Siskel do a lot with what they have -- but they also had a lot to work with.__The portrait Maloof and Siskel assemble here from the scant information available suggests that her fanatical privacy was the darkroom in which her distinctive artistic personality was developed.__The movie does nearly everything right in its chosen, compact, 83-minute form.__An unlikely tale, well told.__Most revealing are the interviews with the now-grown kids who were in Maier's care, who accompanied her as she made trips from their suburban homes to often-dodgy areas of Chicago so she could take photos.__Maloof and co-director Charlie Siskel peel back her layers, allowing us to see where her creative universe came from, how she functioned, what she made.__Maier is a great artist who discounted adulation entirely. Her life was a masquerade; her genius, quite literally, was unexposed.__A self-styled outsider artist comes into focus in Finding Vivian Maier, a striking documentary undertaken after one of its directors bought a nondescript box of photo negatives at a garage sale.__Self-taught and roaming free in the city, Vivian Maier captured the remarkable in the ordinary.__What we find out about Maier, revealed in self-portraits as a striking woman with a singular sense of self, is fascinating.
In its total inspirational sweep, it earns comparison to the movement it chronicles - as an organized, well-calculated piece of political theater.__This film moves effortlessly from some pretty intense dramatic moments to hilarious scenes showcasing the contrasting lifestyles of the gay and straight worlds to some vignettes of incredible poignancy.__This portrayal of the unlikely 1980s alliance between London gay-rights activists and striking Welsh miners is, quite simply, one of the best movies of the year so far.__The important twist is that Pride seems to capture the essence of reality, giving it the recognition it deserves. Truth really is stranger than fiction, and Pride tells that truth with flair.__Schmaltzy and formulaic, but also lively and sincere.__Warchus really knows how to stage musical theater for the movies. He makes you want to dance. More amazing, however, is that he also makes you want to vote.__Pride takes a footnote in the history of Britain's crippling yearlong industrial action and gives it a human face.__Simultaneously touching and funny while being relevant to current events and respectful of the issues involved.__A funny, moving, audience-rousing experience, one that comes out of the closet without quite leaving the safety of the Britcom genre.__It's a feel-good movie that does more than temporarily lift your spirits - it makes you feel a little better about the world, and about our capacity to set aside differences and clasp hands.__A zesty tale of common cause that bursts at the seams with fine performances.__"Pride" leaves the viewer in the satisfied throes of all of those emotions: happy and sad, buoyed and chastened, and wondering, finally, what the world might look like if solidarity really could be forever.__A thoroughly enjoyable movie.__One one level, "Pride" is as fake as a lip-sync revue, yet the emotions it arouses are real.__Some of the characters come from life, others are invented. The sterling actors in "Pride" draw no such distinction.__Oh, it's feel-good, no question about it. But it's also absorbing, important and inspiring.__Feel-good. Also, manipulative. And pandering.__Endearing...__That intriguing premise alone makes it worth giving Pride a look. A strong cast and a powerful story - based on real events, though one only learns that as the final credits roll - makes it a film worth recommending.__The film's high spirits are genuinely infectious. And it says something that 30 years after the events it depicts, Pride should feel so unexpectedly rousing.
Consider Marion Cotillard's Oscar-nominated performance in Two Days, One Night a tour de nuance.__As with their previous films, the brothers cast a discerning gaze on working-class lives, without preachiness or sentimentality.__A dilemma so simple and so timely, it barely feels like fiction.__There is strength in simplicity, something the Dardenne brothers' "Two Days, One Night" and its brilliant star, Marion Cotillard, prove emphatically.__In film after film the Dardennes have proven themselves the cinema's most acute humanist critics of predatory capitalism; this masterful drama finds them at the top of their game.__The Dardennes are aces at these small-scale human dramas, and Two Days, One Night is almost without flaw ...__Coursing underneath the film's calm, observant surface is a fury at a system that sets people in the same leaky boat at each other's throats.__As usual, the Dardenne brothers are never heavy-handed, but also not coy about their politics.__Sooner or later, we all need a helping hand in our lives. But what happens when you need to convince people to extend one?__As a parable on karma, capitalism and Darwinian corporate politics, "Two Days, One Night" can often feel brutal. As a testament to connection, service, sacrifice and self-worth, it's a soaring, heart-rending hymn.__Cannes Film Festival director Thierry Fremaux called it a "Belgian Western," and it's true; echoes of "High Noon" and others reverberate in its bones.__None of this would work if Cotillard's performance weren't so forthright and deeply felt.__The Dardennes take us into the ecosystem of need. By the time they are through, they've cut a wide swath that covers most of the issues of the working class.__A rare thing, a socio-economic thriller, with a moving performance by Cotillard.__The premise is as simple as a biblical parable, and as densely packed with significance.__[A] slice of pressurized middle-class life ... so real, it feels a bit like a documentary.__Cotillard's Sandra is asking a question not only of her colleagues but of the audience, too: Are we willing to put aside our own self-interest for the sake of empathy? Are we cowardly or brave?__Cotillard is magnificent, her luminous eyes reflecting a soul in crisis. The Dardenne brothers have created a film for its time, bristling with peril and alive to every flicker of human decency.__Takes a damning look at how the modern economy handles the working class without ever overstating the case.__Cotillard looks dwindled and drained, leached of allure by the unkind pallor of the lighting.
[Hardy's performance is] the reason you'd see Locke, and the reason you may remember it fondly, long after the ride ends.__Yes, it sounds like a gimmick. But Tom Hardy is so compelling, multilayered and terrific in the title role, this one-man show is never dull.__As you'd expect from a story that never leaves the confines of a car, Locke is intense and claustrophobic.__"Locke" is one riveting film.__For the most part, it works like gangbusters.__As intriguing as Hardy is to watch, the picture can't overcome its cinematic-stunt vibe.__The crises Ivan Locke faces with a tremendous will to do the right thing strike a chord. The mistakes that have him in the driver's seat, but hardly in control, are terribly human and all too familiar.__Knight's strength is his writing, and arguably, Locke would be almost as good set on a stage with a man sitting on a chair. But then you'd miss the details of Hardy's face in a film that is all about an actor's vehicle.__A man, a car, a hands-free mobile device. And it is extraordinary.__The film feels like an exercise in dramatic style, and maybe that's enough for some people. But whether it's for me or for the characters, I need an exercise to generate a little more sweat.__Hardy rises to the gimmick and grounds "Locke" with a performance as watchably charismatic as it is minimalist. You can't take your eyes off him - which is fortunate since there's no one else there.__In the hands of actor Tom Hardy, the story is surprisingly engrossing and compelling, due to Hardy's great skill as an actor and Knight's finely wrought script.__Can we talk for a moment about how amazing it is that a movie like this even exists?__In many ways, the movie feels like the reply to a question: What would happen if we pared down moviemaking to its simplest, most elemental bones?__With tremendous work by actor Tom Hardy anchoring a film that is ripe with dramatic tension, Locke is entirely absorbing despite the limitations imposed by the setting.__The movie's greatest asset by far is Hardy, whose rich, unflappable tones, even in times of high emotional pressure, bear a distinct echo of Richard Burton ...__One of my favorite movies of the last couple years. Great script, Tom Hardy is f*!&ing brilliant in role.__A magnificent drama that resounds with powerful, universal themes.__Of course, the idea of setting a film around a person trapped in a confined space (Buried) or open space ( Gravity) can seem like a gimmick. But when it's done well, as it is here, it's something else: a cinematic joyride.__Shot in just eight nights using a car mounted with three cameras, "Locke" is a terrific example of resourceful, inventive filmmaking.
The result is awkward, hyped propaganda for faith-based initiatives and against abortion.__What remains is a poor man's Precious, with all the earlier film's go-for-broke melodrama but none of its weirdness or empathy for the impoverished.__An after-school special blown up on the big screen, it stridently aims to inspire you. More likely, it'll make you cringe.__Hudgens captures both the defiance and fear of a girl at this crossroads. Her performance elevates what's often a trite and heavy-handed script.__The kind of film that outfits a potentially compelling story with politically convenient signposts - not understanding that sometimes, getting out of the way of a good tale is the best kind of polemical strategy.__It is the galvanizing force of Vanessa Hudgens who catapults Gimme Shelter above the heartbreaking level of soap opera with a lancing effect.__The film is hamstrung by its fidelity to real-life inspirational models.__A predictable story of redemption that happens awfully fast, to a girl who only seems to be in peril briefly - and has a rich dad to bail her out.__A happy-smiley Christian fairy tale disguised as a hard-hitting shard of social realism.__We're drawn in because Hudgens is so good at making this wild child real.__Writer/director Strauss embraces the spiritual elements of this story.__It's so determined to deliver its moral that it loses its grip on the reality of its characters.__"Gimme Shelter" doesn't trust the power of its own story - and the truth of its acting - to deliver the point.__On the Venn diagram where "Preachy Kirk Cameron-esque sermon movie" overlaps with "former child star looking to prove his/her dramatic chops," you'll find the overwrought and undercooked Gimme Shelter.__Over all this is further indication Hudgens is carving out an interesting, productive career path as a film actress.__Filled with very good intentions, very bad dialogue and a surprisingly affecting turn by its star Vanessa Hudgens.__Cogently written and powerfully acted, it's a story about an outcast pregnant teen desperately seeking to survive in a world from which she feels all hope has fled.__Plays like an after-school TV special. Shot after school. At the gym.__Gimme Shelter appears hijacked by the Christian right. Propaganda is a b**ch to act. And this misguided movie leaves Hudgens buried in it.__It is unlikely to convert the unconverted, in part because of its uneven performances, but mostly because it raises more questions than it answers.
For a comedy about emotional pain, this is neither discomforting nor terribly funny, and the satire of bourgeois complacency doesn't cut very deep.__Ultimately, "Force Majeure" becomes a thoughtful examination, through Tomas and Ebba, of the person who lives inside each of us, emerging only in the most unguarded moments - and not always a person we want to acknowledge.__"Force Majeure" is both funny and sad, often in the same glance-averted instant. See it with someone you'd trust to stick around in an avalanche. It's one of the highlights of 2014.__Ostlund has an exquisite eye for the intimate, nonverbal communication between couples through their posture, gestures, their eyes.__"Force Majeure" leaves the audience squirming - in all the very best ways.__Ostlund has a keen eye for human behavior that exacerbates marital discord and dysfunction.__Little but the children's fear of their parents' separation has any dramatic weight.__It is often deliciously, horrifically awkward and downright uncomfortable.__Meticulous and deliberately paced, Force Majeure unexpectedly hits the viewer like an emotional avalanche.__As adroitly written and directed by Sweden's Ruben Ostlund, "Force Majeure" is a precise film about an out-of-control situation.__Slow and, especially in the beginning, sometimes even prosaic, Force Majeure uses very ordinary moments as building blocks for something tense and unnerving.__This is icy-dry comedy, perfectly calibrated to the movie's snowy environs.__The emotional aftermath and battle of gender expectations threatens to be more devastating than any pounding of powder.__The film is beautifully made, with great visuals of the hotel's fine, loneliness-inflicting interiors, and mountain-high slopes where families don't talk to each other very much.__For all the family drama, the film is pretty funny.__"Force Majeure" is a prickly moral comedy for grown-ups, full of sharply observed moments, spectacular scenery and masterfully manipulated atmosphere.__But while you'd think audiences would barely even register a cad any more, two new movies - 'Listen Up Philip' and 'Force Majeure' - resurrect the breed with leading men who are almost impossible to empathize with, but compelling nonetheless.__Filmmaker Ruben Ostlund shifts gears from humor to psychological thriller, redefining courage and family in the process. Force Majeure is a jolt. You won't know what hit you__It is a film that makes your murmur in amazement as you watch and then brood on the dangerous corners in all our lives. It's a quiet avalanche.__Force Majeure is ultimately about something not often explored in film: the consequences of male weakness in a world in which men are expected to be strong at all times.
A theologically questionable but fitfully exciting melodrama about fear and loathing among the non-Raptured.__There's a fundamental problem here. The movie relies on the instinctual human fear of death, but its message is that dying is a promotion.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Hector may indeed learn that narcissism stands in the way of happiness, but he also walks away with his privileges intact and unchallenged.__A movie bearing as faux-naive a title as this has to make a pretty good case for itself. This it decidedly does not do.__Potential peeps out occasionally in Hector and the Search for Happiness, but then flounders and gets lost in a bland sea of sentimentality and cultural myopia.__While there's limited value in Hector's search for happiness and the dozen-plus "lessons" he learns about the emotional state, the film works nicely as a character piece.__This film is a winner. It will not only entertain you, but also make you think about what it takes to bring happiness into your own life.__A rancid, insulting, and cynical dramedy about a man who travels around the world to reconnect with his soul.__A sweet-natured film that flounders a bit before reaching its satisfying destination, "Hector and the Search for Happiness" is about precisely what its title indicates.__It's important that, as we follow Hector's travels and travails, we see him as well-intentioned but flawed. Pegg allows that to come through.__"Hector and the Search for Happiness" tries hard, but fails. Miserably.__The life lessons are patronizingly simple, and the views of exotic locales seem to have come out of an in-flight magazine.__Spoiler alert: Happiness has to do with loving others and self-acceptance.__Although Hector goes to places that are actually on a map, in reality each trip is a journey to Clicheland, where stereotypical characters do stereotypical things, for Hector's observation, excitement and, sometimes, disappointment.__What possibly could have possessed a comedian as sharp as Simon Pegg to squander his gifts on a movie as soggy as Hector And The Search For Happiness?__The film manages, impressively, to be both crushingly banal and offensive in its use of cultural stereotypes.__Mr. Pegg, normally a live wire, makes an affable hero, but the movie often forces him into blandly earnest mugging.__Hector and the Search for Happiness isn't trying to be funny. It's unfashionably earnest, the sort of dopey pound mutt you feel guilty for not showering with love.__"Hector" wants to connect to our inner child, but it feels more like a long story from a good-hearted but dull grandparent.__"Hector and the Search for Happiness'' will most likely inspire audiences to search for the exit door.__Trite, flat-footed, culturally insensitive, and sagging under the weight of more than 25 credited producers ...__At times the whole thing is a hippie's beard whisker away from a clueless pop star on a charidee PR trip to a developing country.
Bleak, brutal, and ultimately pointless, the film stars Guy Pearce as a man whose car is stolen and who won't rest until he not only gets it back but also punishes, with extreme prejudice, the dirtbags who took it.__Of Mice and Men at the end of the world -- that's the general turf of The Rover.__The deadpan irony of the final sequence feels like the punch line of a mournful but very thin joke.__Director David Michod's follow-up to his acclaimed debut, Animal Kingdom, is effective in an elemental way.__Like many a late 21st century Western -- regardless of the land of its origins -- The Rover asks what happens on the downslope of Manifest Destiny? As hot, parched and heated as the atmosphere is, the answers are chilling.__The Rover is so intentionally vague and shapeless, it doesn't leave much of an imprint other than Pattinson's odd, melancholy performance.__The destination doesn't feel worth the journey.__Writer-director David Michod ("Animal Kingdom") likes his violence, but what he's really offering here is an odd bond between two severely damaged men who have little in common beyond the damage.__An evocative, moody road movie through the Australian Outback that's as sparse and dry as the desolate landscape it traverses, its deliberate rhythm punctuated by short periods of shocking, bloody violence.__The Rover does have a central nervous system that crackles and pops with suspense, but in the end it's not enough to jump-start the lack of narrative.__While it's never less than compelling, the characters here are ciphers (particularly a deeply troubled young man played by a grunting Robert Pattinson) and the violence feels wearingly familiar.__It's not just the lack of dialogue but a thin story that keeps this nihilistic tale from conveying a convincing sense of suspense. Too many details are withheld to keep the audience captivated.__A beautifully shot post-apocalyptic fever dream that might have worked as a short but is inconsequential as a feature film.__What makes "The Rover" more watchable than the average self-conscious genre exercise is Pearce, who exudes such weary authority and palpable vulnerability that he's sympathetic even in the film's most brutalizing moments.__There's a thin line between the iconic and the generic, and "The Rover," a grim post-apocalyptic drama from down under, wanders back and forth across it in an adrenaline daze.__You might call it a morality play, if there were any morality to speak of at play.__Forget "gritty." "The Rover" is so rank that if you cut yourself on it, you'd need a tetanus shot.__Michod not only stints on the big backstory but is sometimes weak on story.__It's impressive for its ingenuity in suggesting, on a relatively low budget, a 21st century in which the world monetary system has disintegrated, leaving every man for himself.__The movie's overall cast of gloom - no one here has cracked a smile in years - contributes to a leaden aura.
An old-school drama so sincere, yet so ham-fisted, it borders on parody.__A little-known tale of Jewish resistance during the final days of WWII gets tackled with appreciable ambition and blunt, sporadic emotional force in "Walking With the Enemy."__Sometimes awkward and melodramatic, the debut film from director Mark Schmidt nevertheless derives strength from its little-known true-life story of Holocaust heroism.__The film is as dramatically inert as its origins are inspirational.__A plodding and clunky drama that never misses an opportunity to embrace a cliche.__A badly written, poorly acted, bathetic pageant of bad wigs and worse accents, rendered with production values on a par with NBC's recent Sound of Music mummery.__The film is so emotionally obvious and awkwardly handled that it doesn't deserve much consideration as a political or historical statement ...__Constant title cards introducing historical figures suggest the work of a completist rather than a filmmaker who has focused the material.__Motivated by an earnest need to inspire, Schmidt's debut suffers from stiffness but improves as it goes, the tension of its plot overcoming many dramatic failings.__A determined historical sweep masks a small-minded bid for easy outrage and heartstrings-pulling in the schematic World War II drama "Walking With the Enemy."__It does reduce a period of irredeemable horror to the heroics of a single person.__A simple retelling of these stories would have been more dramatic, more effective and more powerful.__The title "Walking With the Enemy" suggests a peculiar lack of urgency, so it's a disappointingly accurate handle indeed.__This is a dark, horrible history, and yet there are times when "Walking With the Enemy" feels like "To Be Or Not to Be," only without Jack Benny, or like "Hogan's Heroes" without the jokes.__Unfortunately, the nuances of these intense scenarios are lost in favor of action beats and a bombastic orchestral score.__As with many other WWII films, it takes genuinely stirring source material -- a young Hungarian man poses as a Nazi to find his dislocated family -- and reduces it to its most shopworn components.__Its impact is special and inescapable.__After 20 shaky opening minutes, first-time director Mark Schmidt finds his footing with this slightly overlong English-language Holocaust drama.__None__None
For all its problems, The Captive does try to hit the themes that have obsessed Egoyan for three decades: desire, death, memory, and time.__Becomes baroque and ludicrous as the Hitchcockian scenario loses its psychological bearings in a web of trashy plot twists and self-conscious jumps in time.__The infuriatingly vague and downright strange story banishes the haunting delicacy of mood that Mr. Egoyan has conjured so successfully in the past.__The structural gamesmanship is just a smokescreen, a way to obfuscate the pulp nature of what is, ultimately, little more than a glorified, low-aiming potboiler.__Surely an Oscar-nominated filmmaker like Atom Egoyan ("The Sweet Hereafter") can do better than this nasty and unconvincing thriller.__When it isn't TV-movie familiar, Egoyan's film is bughouse crazy, mixing in campy pulp elements that bleed pressure away from the story.__"The Captive" bores us with its onscreen mystery while leaving another, more important one unanswered: What exactly happened to director Atom Egoyan?__The Captive recapitulates the arc of Egoyan's career: early promise, followed by arrant misfires.__Without a thin tether to credibility, this fussy, morbid fantasy simply slides off into the void.__Beneath the well-tuned atmospherics lurks a schlocky, ludicrous and distasteful yarn__The director renders an already bogus story more preposterous by lathering it in portentous solemnity ...__This ludicrous abduction thriller plays like an ill-advised assembly of tropes and themes from Atom Egoyan's highlights reel.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Shelton's comedy isn't just smart, but cheerfully wise; not just funny, but cleverly and endlessly so.__Shelton opts for a simple shooting style that emphasizes relationships and dialogue rather than trying to call attention to the filmmaker's talent.__We understand, you're having trouble growing up. Get on with it, and while you're doing so, amuse us. Luckily, the movie does a pretty good job at that while keeping things overly safe for its hapless heroine, Megan, played by Keira Knightley.__This is the first feature that the talented Lynn Shelton has directed from someone else's script, and it often seems like a premise trying to graduate into an actual story.__"Laggies" demonstrates that childhood is tough, but adulthood gives you a real drubbing.__A familiar story, albeit from a fresh female perspective and enlivened by a fine cast.__By dint of its on-screen talent, "Laggies" qualifies as a genial, puttering indie with a starrier cast.__"Laggies" is the kind of indie film that gives the genre a bad name.__In short, it's fun to watch the actors work. But you wish they had material a little stronger to work with.__How much you get out of this American indie romcom will depend on where you stand on Keira Knightley doing her goofy, 'What me?' normal girl routine.__Laggies is far from perfect, but it gives us a world we like spending time in. And that's kind of its point.__A movie that is, in every way, nothing special - except for the way it's made and how it's done.__Unlike its sometimes annoyingly wishy-washy heroine, this is a movie that knows just where it's going, and finds joy in the journey.__Man-child movies have long been commonplace for members of the opposite sex, so "Laggies," penned by Andrea Seigel, is a welcome twist, one with more than a little in common with "Bridesmaids."__Laggies presents an intermittently believable portrait of female arrested development.__Wry situations and inventive acting, all caught clearly on camera, and shaped into a satisfying whole.__A lovely lark that provides a lively consideration of the benefits of taking a break from the pressure of keeping up with the twentysomething Joneses.__The dialogue, written by novelist and first-time screenwriter Andrea Seigel, sparks with life.__This is a nice movie. It's frisky and cheerful, even when tears are on the way. But it isn't a very good movie, mainly because, like its heroine, it's reluctant to make up its mind about what it wants to be.__Laggies is undone by the sitcom contrivance of its scenario and some very on-the-nose dialogue, which keeps reminding viewers that, yes, this is a story about willful regression.
The true-life horse-racing tale "50 to 1" takes forever to get galloping - and when it finally does, it's too little too late.__If "50 to 1" were about 15 minutes shorter, all of this might have made for a passable diversion. As it is, "50 to 1," much like Mine That Bird, flags before reaching the finish line.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
With Haider, [Bhardwaj] wisely forgoes the rough-edged attitude in his other films to embrace a slicker and more sophisticated style; and some of the film's most effective moments are masterful in their visual storytelling skill.__The result is a tense, well crafted drama that lacks the deep emotional intensity required in its disturbed characters.__"Haider" may not be the equal of Mr. Bhardwaj's other Shakespeare films, and it may be deficient in the "Hamlet" department, but it certainly gives good Gertrude.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"Third Person" is such a solipsistic, navel-gazing creation that it seems to have barely made it out of Haggis' mind and onto the screen.__Even if the story begins to melt into itself, at the end it's still fascinating to watch Haggis move his players.__It's all, I'm sorry to say, a melodramatic slog.__"Third Person" doesn't lack for ambition, and it's nice to see Neeson in the kind of role that he excelled at before he morphed into an action star. But the film may have some folks wishing they'd bought a ticket to "Transformers 4" instead.__Trust is essential to any love relationship, writer-director Paul Haggis wants us to know, though he trusts us so little to grasp this theme ourselves that he makes his alter ego here, a world-weary novelist played by Liam Neeson, spell it out.__Plumbing emotional depths, Haggis turns the characters' tribulations onto the viewer: If white is the color of trust -- as Neeson's author writes -- aren't we all a little gray?__It makes sense that these people all seem puzzled. They're pieces.__Third Person falls into a kind of fugue state. The lines between characters become blurred, their respective losses and heartbreaks dissolving into a melancholy vapor. Or vapidity. Take your pick.__"Third Person" staggers well over the two-hour mark only to self-destruct in a burst of overwrought cleverness.__The look of the film is gorgeous, the actors inhabit their roles convincingly, and its artistic aims are higher than most. Still, I can't endorse the self-consciously clever result.__Though Haggis has crafted an ambitious tale, it is way too complicated and convoluted.__"Third Person" aims to be singular, but winds up being hoist on its own conceit: Fiction may not be real, but we're still supposed to believe at least a word of it.__"Third Person" is Paul Haggis' best movie, and the one he has been building toward for years.__Writer-director Paul Haggis' exasperating multistory drama about how hard it is for a nice, quiet, sensitive guy to be left alone to write an exasperating multistory drama.__Haggis has written and directed better films than "Third Person," and I bet he'll make even better ones in the future.__Another drama-orama that, like Crash, piles up stories that aren't all that much worth telling in the first place.__It's not so much that Paul Haggis is a bad filmmaker but that his talents seem so unsuited to what he apparently wants to do.__It gets too clever - perhaps a sign of those 20, or 50, endlessly tweaked different drafts.__The muddled concept is forced to the point of breaking, the writing overheated and the story arc grimly perplexing.__"Third Person" maddens far more than it intrigues. Indeed, more curious than anything about the movie itself is how such an artistic stumble happened.
Too often does [Bondarchuk] goad his characters to brim over with righteous bloodlust-and, despite the occasional obligatory misgiving about the barbarism of war, goads the audience to lust right along with them.__If you thought Saving Private Ryan needed to be more like 300, then Stalingrad is the movie for you.__Overall, Stalingrad is a bizarre concoction, part Putin-era patriotic chest-thumping and part creaky war melodrama, all set in a superbly recreated ruined city.__Stalingrad is long and operatic, but its message is simple enough: War is hell, but hell, it makes for good cinema.__To wave a flag, sing a song and celebrate it as the uncomplicated and inevitable victory of good over evil is the sort of easy message only an old propagandist - or a president for life - could really cheer.__Stalingrad largely succeeds in sensory terms but doesn't fare so well in dramatic ones.__A film that seeks to memorialize by blunt force.__Though plenty of road-tested war truths about sacrifice, honor, grit and intimacy get trotted out, "Stalingrad" is deep down a spectacle campaign forged in operatic violence and a siege of the senses, and on those terms it has its moments.__[Bondarchuk's] hand tends to feel heavy, especially when he's celebrating young love in wartime (shades of - ugh - "Pearl Harbor"), but the actors sometimes work wonders.__If the director and his screenwriters had concocted a scenario to equal their grasp of military calamity, they could have created a classic.__Russian director Fedor Bondarchuk's treatment of the World War II turning point is shallow and contrived, if sometimes impressively staged. The movie wins points, however, for sheer wackiness.__It's hardly the contemporary answer to "Battleship Potemkin," but the World War II drama "Stalingrad" does hold the distinction of being the biggest box-office success in Russian cinema history.__After a devastating opening, the movie gets sluggish here and there, but it remains interesting throughout, not just culturally, but as a piece of drama.__If you're going to make a movie about the bloodiest battle in human history, perhaps there's no place for subtlety. "Stalingrad" goes for big explosions and bigger theatrics, and it works.__There's just one problem: The story.__Though the performances aren't bad at all, everyone is playing one-note stereotypes in this cat-and-mouse game as Bondarchuk marks time for an impressively staged climax with lots of pyrotechnics.__Yes, the film is gorgeous - assuming you want to see rubble and soot and frostbite rendered as eye candy.__The only problem is that the film, while certainly impressive in its effects and a few rock-'em sock-'em battle scenes, is sorely lacking in crucial areas, namely characterization and narrative.__At first, the idea seems ingenious, but inevitably, complexity is sacrificed: The Russians are either jokey-brave or sincere-brave, while a vicious German colonel, usually seen eating or yelling, is your typical pig.__On the most basic level, Stalingrad is a simple war picture, straightforward in its brutality. But there's another movie nestled inside, a more complex, somber one. And that one needs no special 3D effects.
I can't get Enemy's peculiar, fevered mood, or the memory of that wackadoo last image, out of my head.__A spooky enigma, more ponderous than provocative, more silly than suspenseful.__Despite some flaws and frustrations, this is one movie whose ending you will not see coming.__Enemy is a bewilderingly skillful metaphysical thriller combining Swiss-watch engineering and surrealism, like one of Dali's melted timepieces.__Movies about doubles are, almost by definition, creepy, but Villeneuve, not to be outdone, piles on the weirdness.__"Enemy" is what might happen if someone let Terrence Malick make a "Twilight Zone" episode, with a quick rewrite by David Cronenberg.__Despite Gyllenhaal's twitchy, two-headed performance, "Enemy" is hobbled by a genetic flaw: Suspension of disbelief has a twin called suspicion of dumbness.__Denis Villeneuve's moody, intriguing and, yes, occasionally silly psychological thriller.__The story's dour flatness keeps it from being as disturbing as it aims to be.__The wan, lifeless palette matches the film's overarching tone of drained, depressive enervation.__"Enemy" may be built more on questions than answers, but in the probing it generates a satisfyingly arch hum of weirdness.__This is fitfully successful as a mood piece, though the dream imagery is heavy-handed, the characters sketchily realized, and the high-toned dialogue comes out stilted more often than not.__Watching "Enemy," in which Gyllenhaal cleverly delineates the character differences and confidence levels of the two leading roles, it's clear that the movie is messing with you, in a highly calibrated fashion.__Not just dark but dank, Denis Villeneuve's "Enemy" is a surpassingly creepy film about identity.__"Enemy" is quietly and effectively eerie except when it's idiotic. Oh, well.__The movie sticks to you ... and the ending is strange and sudden enough to make you revise, or interrogate, all that has come before.__Enemy operates on a level of carefully calibrated unease, where the very elusiveness of motivation and logic is exploited for purposes of sustained cinematic disorientation.__Even if "Enemy" sometimes goes too far - and, in proffering any kind of internal logic, never goes far enough - it grips your attention from the very first scene. And will haunt you long after its last.__Enemy slowly but surely envelops us, like the web of the spider that seems to be crawling from Adam's psyche right into the real world.__There is only so much sense a movie like this needs to make, and this one succeeds in being divertingly clever and effectively creepy.
The film has a solid grasp on the mutable, but ever-present pain of loss.__The line between terrifying reality and terrifying fantasy isn't so much blurred as altogether obliterated.__This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times.__It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody.__At its heart, "The Babadook" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying.__In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane.__As someone who has developed a pretty thick Critic's Shield from years of watching standard haunted house/possessed human/mythological-creature fare, I have to say I was genuinely freaked out by some of the passages in The Badabook.__The Babadook makes a convincing argument for classy, psychological horror cinema even as it fails to meet its own lofty standard.__This is a dark and shivery story about motherhood, a common subject for horror movies, but one that's rarely treated with such intelligence or seriousness of intent.__Kent has taste, an eye and a knack for brisk, accelerated pacing. In the case of "The Babadook," familiarity breeds an eerily gratifying contentment.__Jennifer Kent's startling debut is an artful horror-chiller that gets under your skin and into your psyche.__Credit writer-director Jennifer Kent for lending her Australian indie a healthy dose of brains and subtlety, giving it a distinct advantage over most modern horror films.__"The Babadook" is urgent, uncanny and entirely disturbing, a dream within a dream within a nightmare. It is the best English language supernatural film of this new century.__With its mixture of frights both literal and literary, "The Babadook" will, I suspect, satisfy horror's devotees as much as the genre's doubters.__This is a really scary movie.__Sometimes you go to a movie and know from the first image that whoever made it knows what she's doing. You don't need convincing. You're there with her. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook is like that.__Director Kent has made the kind of striking film that is going to have mainstream Hollywood haunting her like a Babadook in a bad mood. For the sake of her idiosyncratic vision, let's hope she doesn't frighten easily.__No matter how successful The Babadook turns out to be - and Jennifer Kent's horror story deserves all the success it gets - the prospects of a best-selling kid-lit tie-in don't look good.__A potent journey through the fears, anxieties, and repressed rages of motherhood.__Shot in chilly shades of blue, "The Babadook" will haunt anyone who's ever heard a cry in the night - or wondered what was under the bed, in the dark.
Particle Fever explores with awe-inspiring precision, and in remarkably accessible language, how 10,000 scientists and engineers from around the world built what in effect is the ultimate test tube for particle physics.__The enthusiasm, idealism, and cheerful brilliance of the six subjects convey the thrill, if not the full significance, of this scientific breakthrough.__It plays out with all the suspense of a thriller.__Levinson makes the story accessible and entertaining for mainstream viewers.__Even the most math-averse viewer will be on pins and needs to know the results.__The filmmakers find room for some witty philosophical bull sessions and affectionate portraits of some of the physicists; this is an agreeable light entertainment on a complex subject.__Even if you can't explain the Standard Model or define "supersymmetry," you'll walk away with a conviction that you've vicariously participated in a historic event.__The bracing scientific rigor and intellectual derring-do presented in "Particle Fever" are most welcome.__All you really need to know about Particle Fever is that it includes footage of physicists rapping. About physics. Wearing giant Einstein masks.__The film allows for our awe. It also demonstrates that science is the most human of activities, with all that that implies.__Set in crummy offices and towering facilities worthy of a Bond movie, the documentary is edited with the momentum of a thriller by the great Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now), as we follow six scientists.__Watching a film won't make you smarter, but if there ever was one that could, it would be "Particle Fever," a movie so mind-bending you can almost feel your brain cells growing as you're watching it.__As fictional Vulcan Spock might have pronounced: "Fascinating."__Talk about a smash hit.__A compelling, if sometimes difficult to follow, story.__A movie that's not just accessible but fun, with a surprisingly emotional payoff at the end.__Particle Fever is that rare, exhilarating science doc that's neither dumbed down nor drabbed up.__The experience of watching the film can be vertiginous: You toggle between the tiny and the infinite, between eternity and the real time of the recent past.__A dazzling, dizzying documentary about nothing less than whether we exist in a coherent universe of ordered, even beautiful laws ...__A documentary about science for professionals and laypeople alike, Particle Fever celebrates an event of earth-shattering importance, though what far-ranging transformations it heralds remain unknown
"Song of the Sea" creates a magical world, one that pulls you in and leaves you, when it's over, feeling changed by the journey.__Sweet, aesthetically breathtaking ...__Moore manages this life-affirming touch without being preachy and by simply melding unusual old folktales into a new story filled with visually stunning images sure to captivate children of all ages.__Irish director Tomm Moore's animated beauty Song of the Sea tells the sort of story that makes you crave the flickering of firelight or wish for the warmth of a blanket pulled up to your chin while mom or dad reads a bedtime tale.__Irish animator Tomm Moore follows his celebrated feature debut, The Secret of Kells, with another ravishing fantasy based on Irish folklore.__A film about terrible things that ensue when overprotective love separates a child from her heritage and represses the natural expression of grief.__A transcendent work from Ireland's Cartoon Saloon studio that's almost wasted on kids.__Enchants on every level: story, voice work, drawing and music.__The filmmakers evoke earned emotion with gentle hands. Even the monstrous antagonist is presented in such an unadorned fashion as to make it almost normal - and therefore creepier.__You'll leave the film knowing more than you might have imagined about Irish culture, but never once feeling subjected to anything Very Special or Good for You.__It's a refreshing respite from popular kids' fare, an extended bedtime story that has its share of harrowing moments but gradually wraps the soul in a warm blankie.__If I had to recommend the best children's film out there for all ages, this one, and The Tale of Princess Kaguya, would easily top the charts.__"Song of the Sea" is a wonder to behold. This visually stunning animation masterwork, steeped in Irish myth, folklore and legend, so adroitly mixes the magical and the everyday that to watch it is to be wholly immersed in an enchanted world.__Mr. Moore's second feature, "Song of the Sea," amply fulfills the shining promise of the first one.__Inviting? Very much so.__"Song of the Sea" moves delicately but purposefully from pain to contentment and from anger to love.__Moore's film is so busy ladling on the sweet ethereal frosting of its world that Ben and Saoirse feel less like characters than they do ornamental toppings ...__They don't make movies like this anymore - except when, lucky us, they do.__The picture is beautifully rendered in pencils and watercolors, with some CG, giving it an appropriately timeless storybook look, even though it's set in a mostly modern world of buses and 3-D glasses.__Song of the Sea is another satisfying smack in the face of computer-generated 3D animation from Irish director Tomm Moore, after his earlier, Oscar-nominated The Secret of Kells.
With Ebert's blessing and encouragement, Life Itself is a warts-and-all look at how the son of an Illinois electrician and housewife became a prolific writer who spent 46 years as the film critic at the Chicago Sun Times.__What comes through most in Life Itself, a film named after Ebert's 2011 memoir, is his great, open-minded vigor.__If you aren't moved by Life Itself, you ought to have your heart examined.__The film's core is footage shot during the last four months of Ebert's life, when he had lost most of his jaw and was unable to eat or speak. It's hard to see him in this state, which makes his frequent cheerfulness and humor all the more remarkable.__No less than James's capital punishment documentary At the Death House Door, this asks us to think long and hard about what it means to die with dignity.__That [Siskel and Ebert] weren't very nice to each other might be the too-easy takeaway of outtakes of their on-set interactions. James allows that relationship to be more complicated and vital.__It also makes clear that Ebert didn't want to partake in a movie that sweetened who he was. He'd be proud to know that the movie of his life is sugar-free.__A tribute and historical perspective on the man behind a pop-cultural phenomenon.__This movie is never maudlin or sentimental. It shows us a man who, whatever his flaws, seemed to live his life in exactly the right way.__Life Itself reminds you how unpredictable Ebert's tastes: He loved Benji the Hunted and tore Scarface and Blue Velvet apart.__An account that's affectionate but also honest, taking the title and much of the content of Ebert's bestselling 2011 autobiography.__"Life Itself" completes the circular conversation between the movies, the man and the masses.__Though Life Itself is a warts-and-all portrait Ebert didn't live to review, my guess is his thumbs would be shooting upward. Mine sure are.__Ebert once described the cinema as "a machine that generates empathy." Watching James's lovely film, you know exactly what he means.__What makes Life Itself such a wonderful documentary is that it weds Ebert's passion for the good things in life to his quest to find great movies.__[Ebert's] clear, sensible prose will probably hold up better than some of the more frantic efforts of his contemporaries. His greatest legacy, however, as this film documents, was his courage in the endgame of his life.__Incisive, graceful and, yes, deeply empathetic.__A portrait of Ebert that is funny, moving, sad, harrowing and ultimately uplifting.__How fitting that America's most important movie critic has become the subject of a fine movie himself.__A beautifully paced tribute to a life well-lived.
Nymphomaniac is convincing as a work of philosophical seriousness.__"Nymphomaniac: Vol I" is crazy. It's funny, it's lewd, it's disturbing, it's odd, it's extremely graphic, it's brutal. And if you can handle all that, it's pretty good.__Without an explanation for the protagonist's physical and emotional injuries, it's a head-scratcher. As with Joe's sexual compulsion, scratching can't cure the itch.__Lars von Trier is funny. Who knew? That's certainly the most startling revelation to come from Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 .__A pornographic work of art-obsessive, repetitive, at times remarkably eccentric, but never simple-minded or dull.__The most shocking thing about the film is that it often prompts laughs.__Think of Nymphomaniac Vol. 1 as the first half of a longer tale which, if von Trier has taught us anything, will grow infinitely darker and more harrowing.__Master of controversy Lars von Trier has baited his hook with the promise of lewd spectacle, but he reels us in for a philosophical sermon.__Von Trier is after nothing less than the human condition here, and even if he doesn't always hit the mark, he absolutely deserves points for ambition.__Thurman is the one blast of the life force in this handsome, sometimes funny, oddly remote film.__One of [Von Trier's] most sympathetic films since "Dancer in the Dark."__Nymphomaniac: Vol. I is intimate, in-your-face, and, mostly, enjoyably ridiculous.__[Von Trier's] internal battles with freedom and restrictions, though not always pretty or wise, provide us with these uniquely troubled stories and images.__Lars von Trier has buffaloed all of us once again with one of the strangest and least summarizable motion pictures ever made: tragic and hilarious, tightly constructed and miscellaneous.__It provides, perhaps like the experiences of love and sex, a shifting variety of insights, emotions, unexpected lightness and moments of visceral shock.__When you get down to the short strokes, Nymphomania is a very good film that could have been a great one.__Highly explicit, but more intellectual than erotic. Music, math and sex make an intriguing jumble of ideas, though coherence may not appear until "Volume II."__For those who don't equate sexual appetite with the intricacies of fly fishing, Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 is more tiresome than titillating.__You're unlikely to turn away.__What's most disquieting about "Nymph()maniac" is how funny, tender, thoughtful, and truthful it is, even as it pushes into genuinely seamy aspects of onscreen sexuality.
A pale imitation of the early novels of Bret Easton Ellis, who wrote about young ennui and aimlessness from the inside out.__Ultimately, "Palo Alto" is a messy yet haunting portrait of a particular time in life.__It's accurate to say that "Palo Alto" is another movie by another Coppola about the lives of the rich, bored and disaffected, but that description sells the movie short.__While it shows Coppola has talent, it's also as aimless as her characters' self-absorbed, self-medicated, joyless lives.__That Coppola finds occasional grace and spirit here shows understanding and compassion. Her next assignment? Make a movie that's not about the troubles of the privileged and bored.__These slippery slices of life feel like the most honest, relevant film portrait of adolescence in ages.__"Palo Alto" feels earnest and promising, but half-formed.__A slice-of-life story that does a good job italicizing how little moments in the big scheme of things can seem like monumental disasters while one is in high school.__It's hard getting past the benign "menace" of the gangs, the corny out-of-touchness of the parentals, the stodgy morality of it all.__"Palo Alto" has a strong feel for youthful fumblings that fall between self-pity and self-definition, and it's especially wise about the parallel world of American adolescents ...__The adaptation of this coming-of-age tale is stylishly brought to the screen, even if it feels a bit light on substance.__The movie often recalls Larry Clark's early work in its effortless authenticity, though in contrast to his emotional brutality, the tone here is gentle and understanding.__"Palo Alto" is something to watch and afterward say, "Yes, high school is something like that, isn't it?" That makes this film almost but not quite worth the investment.__Palo Alto marks one of those rare films that is so accurate in its portrayal of characters that the movie suffers for it.__While "Palo Alto" might not point the teen genre into revolutionary new directions, it does achieve a major goal: Putting its talented filmmaker and cast on the cinematic map.__The catalogue of petty derelictions and frustrated yearnings is anchored by no inner world, framed by no context, and there's nothing distinctive in the twenty-six-year-old Gia Coppola's direction.__From the first few scenes in Palo Alto it's obvious Gia Coppola is a natural director.__In the end, it's all a bit too slight and self-pitying to truly engage our interest; not so much "Less Than Zero" as less than compelling.__Franco's stories, sometimes coarse and flimsy on the page, operate like launch pads for a slew of fresh, frisky performers. But the delicacy of the movie's narrative and its almost mystical thread of yearning come from Coppola.__Conjures a delicate, very specific sense of middle-class adolescence, the indeterminate, nascent feelings of the teenage years.
Eenhoorn brings an understated wry quality to his performance that nicely counterbalances Nelson's unflagging bonhomie.__[An] engaging, low-key character study.__As a performance showcase it's intriguing simply because Eenhoorn and Nelson barely belong to the same species, so different are they in demeanor.__"Land Ho!" is an indie oddball of a movie that wanders about with two seniors looking to squeeze a bit more out of life. The squeezing is gentle but affirming, just like the film.__It's a visual treat, yet has little else to offer.__A road-trip movie about a couple of guys nearing the end of life's road, Land Ho! is a sweetly simple tale that underscores what we already know but too often forget: Adventurism and finding your bliss are not just for the young.__Like most stars of road movies, they're an odd couple; unlike most, both the friction between them and their underlying loyalty feel real, not contrived to supply a movie's dramatic arc.__A marvelous slice of lo-fi whimsy about two duffers, longtime acquaintances in the gray zone between middle age and old age, who up and travel from Kentucky to the Land of Fire and Ice.__A low-key, odd-couple comedy built mostly around Nelson's coarse ad-libs and Eenhoorn's sighing reactions.__"Land Ho!" is a tepid little movie that goes almost nowhere, and if I had to sit in that rental car for one more boob joke, I'd rather jump into a volcano.__The movie is pleasant and mostly forgettable, except for the character of Mitch.__Small, unexpected moments elevate Land Ho!__It's like being subjected to a 90-minute vacation slide show by someone you don't care about.__You realize fairly early in the film that there will be no emotional payoff. Just an hour and a half of vacation photos in motion.__The road-trip comedy is well-traveled territory, especially in indie films. But there's something unexpectedly refreshing about "Land Ho!"__The juxtaposition of mundane silliness and those primordial, mythic landscapes proves unexpectedly magical.__The gorgeous scene stealer in this gentle-spirited road movie is the country of Iceland, depicted in breathtaking wide-angle shots by cinematographer Andrew Reed.__Yes, this is yet another bromance, but for people who remember when that was just called friendship.__What turns the trip around, though, for the odd couple and for us, is their bond of deep friendship, and the slow thawing of their frozen lives in a chilly climate.__Land Ho! is well worth an expedition to the movie theater.
Scenes between YSL and rock-steady lover Pierre Berge (Guillaume Gallienne) spark, but the film stays too reverent to truly turn heads.__This glitzy biopic of the renowned French fashion designer doesn't offer much insight into its subject or milieu.__The film takes on a dour note as way too much time is spent on Saint Laurent's drunken antics. He comes across as sullen and not very likable. This may be true to the man, but what of his other side?__Does a film with haute couture as its heart guarantee an elegant cinematic experience? In the case of Yves Saint Laurent, a biopic about the legendary French couturier, the answer is a tired non.__Despite being sumptuously shot and competently assembled, it provides no real insight into the tortured mind of its subject or the creative process in general.__A visually sumptuous - and perhaps languidly paced - tale that immerses the viewer in a deeply atmospheric world.__Alternately meek and tyrannical, repressed and Dionysian, Niney's Saint Laurent remains both empathetic and obscure.__When he wasn't silent, Yves Saint Laurent could be cruel and selfish. He may have been a genius, but if he was at all likable, this movie doesn't show it.__Much has been documented about Saint Laurent and Berge in films, books and exhibitions, but Yves Saint Laurent... attempts to show the personal side of the designer and his consort.__Its tendency to tell rather than show seems ill-suited to a portrait of the man who brought haute couture to the masses.__Ultimately, the story of Yves Saint Laurent makes a compelling argument for fashion as art, and begs to answer the question if there is such a thing as innate taste.__Skillfully made ...__Saint Laurent (played with uncanny accuracy by Pierre Niney) goes through nervous breakdowns, addictions and affairs with gold diggers, but remains a comparatively opaque personality.__Yves Saint Laurent epitomizes the mediocrity of a genre that often aspires to secondhand storytelling instead of first-rate art.__Had he seen his own bio backstage, you can't help but feel he would have fussed with it a bit more before sending it out so unadorned.__A tasteful and formulaic biopic, visually lush but emotionally shallow.__Ultimately, this biopic seems far more interested in Saint Laurent's emotional passions, and the love story between him and Berge serves as the movie's core.__Mr. Lespert and his screenwriters tend to telegraph what's happening next with on-the-nose dialogue, leaving behind an orderly but not vividly realized biography (or necessarily a complete one).__Yves Saint Laurent gives us some idea of what it cost to be Yves Saint Laurent. But it also makes us feel for the guy who wasn't ashamed to leave his fingerprints on the money.__What makes this film go astray are the problems that plague so many screen biographies: too much narration, too much telling and not enough showing, and presenting an artist's accomplishments in lieu of exploring his perspective.
As the narratives build toward their predictable conclusions, "Men, Women & Children" seems wholly unaware that these various evils existed long before Facebook and Instagram.__"Men, Women & Children" is crowded with characters and subplots, a few of which resonate - but more often, an individual's story seems lost in the cyberflurry.__It's like a collection of shared and traded Instagram posts. Revealing the telling moments of individual lives in snapshots leaves an itch to dig deeper.__In trying to be a big, important movie, "Men, Women & Children" is about none of the above.__Men, Women & Children attempts to achieve the tone of Reitman's early films, pirouetting between behavioral levity and dark melodrama, yet it often falls flat.__The problem with Men, Women & Children - and it's a big one - is that the movie isn't telling us anything we don't already know.__These characters are extremes but Reitman employs them in this microcosm to dramatic (and sometimes darkly comedic) purposes.__These interwoven tales of suburban parents and high-schoolers--united by the common themes of sex, alienation, and the Internet--amount to a kind of techno-misanthropic Love Actually.__This is one of the worst movies of the year -- maybe the worst.__It is the year's scariest film simply because it's the year's most realistic: Welcome to your nightmare.__It's a wonder the actors aren't showing bruise marks from all the heavy-handed direction, the unrelenting solemnity of the thing.__the moments when Men, Women & Children transcends its limitations and offers a raw-nerved portrait of the Internet-infected suburbs are powerful - nearly enough to forgive the film's diffuse focus and flab.__Reitman and Wilson have many good ideas, but "Men, Women & Children" has too many men, women, and children.__The film is so enamored of its own facile ironies that it fails to go anywhere with its observations.__Men, Women & Children is as anxious to seem contemporary as any after-school special.__Jason Reitman has lost his touch in Men, Women & Children, a scolding sermon on the evils of the Internet. Preacher Reitman won't be satisfied till we stomp our smartphones. LOL. WTF.__The moments in "Men, Women & Children" that are supposed to sting - like the malls and high school hallways filled with text-bubbles over everyone's heads as they walk obliviously past each other - are already a visual cliche.__Think a computer-driven, de-fanged Crash, without the ethnic diversity. Not exactly an epic fail, it could have used a reboot.__Men, Women & Children may not be Reitman's best, but points to the Canadian director for ambition and assembling an admirable cast with not a weak performance in the bunch.__So depressing and pretentious that you may wonder how it got that way.
Plays out as a wistful, slow-burning romance, underscored with a streak of social satire and animated in exquisitely subtle pastels and watercolours.__It's the beautiful and breathtaking animation that gives The Tale of the Princess Kaguya a luster that is both simple and sophisticated.__One can only hope Ghibli maintains a creative standard as high as his.__What makes "Princess Kaguya" stick in emotional terms? Its depiction of an extraordinary girl, learning for herself that a life without real joy and spontaneity is only a shadow of a life.__This delicate, hand-drawn marvel is lyrical and heartbreaking in ways that most live-action movies never approach.__If there's a message here about the foolhardiness of parental expectations, it fades away in the face of the film's rapturous visuals.__The hand-drawn details are breathtaking, with a cautionary and compelling story for tweens and older kids to share with their parents.__It's more deeply satisfying and complex than similar, Hollywood-produced fare - like fine wine compared with Kool-Aid.__With no bombast whatsoever, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya manages to stir the soul.__Although most know the name Hayao Miyazaki, there are many wonderful directors under the Ghibli umbrella, and Isao Takahata is as great as they come.__It's wondrous to watch the enchanted Princess, given a title but not a name, swell instantly into twice her size in the arms of the Bamboo Cutter's wife.__It's the best kind of fairy tale - tough, deep and meaningful, with a heroine who stays true to herself in spite of shallow temptations.__Based on an old, popular Japanese legend, it starts off like an odd little fable, but then its expansive sadness sneaks up on you.__A real treat for animation fans, although its meditative pace may test the patience of younger viewers.__"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya" is a marvel of Japanese animation, a hand-drawn, painterly epic that submerges us in a world of beauty.__Exquisitely drawn with both watercolor delicacy and a brisk sense of line, the film finds a peculiarly moving undertow of feeling in a venerable Japanese folk tale about a foundling country girl who can't shake a sense of being out of place.__Like all fairy tales worth their salt, the movie trusts children to take on the big themes of life, death and despair included, and thus removes the sting.__Notably, the original story was called "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter," but Takahata's title puts the focus where it belongs.__A lovely, glacially told gem from animator Isao Takahata, the 78-year-old cofounder with Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli.__Distills a millennium of Japanese storytelling into a timeless film that feels both ancient and alive in equal measure.
Frankie & Alice feels like a film that might have been groundbreaking 40 years ago but has cable-TV movie of the week written all over it in 2014.__Berry has proven she's willing to take on enormous challenges, and she certainly exceeds her grasp here. Perhaps that's why Frankie & Alice plays more like an elaborate acting workshop than a movie.__While all this channel-switching and inevitable unearthing of psychic demons generates a great awards-season clip, it doesn't necessarily lead to a satisfying drama.__It may be that this genre has been forever ruined, or just that it requires a more subtle hand than the one exhibited by Geoffrey Sax, the director here.__Lamentably by-the-numbers, treated like an affliction-of-the-week TV movie by its eight (!) credited writers and directed by Geoffrey Sax as if he knew where commercials should go.__It's hard to see beyond Berry's forced mannerisms. She swerves from boogie-dancing tough girl to stoic matron to irritatingly voiced kid.__Old-fashioned as a leisure suit, but better-looking and a lot more fun.__Frankie & Alice is lurid - again, she's a stripper - and occasionally silly in the way that so many multiple-personality stories wind up being.__Berry shows total commitment to the part, allowing herself to go unhinged in the hands of a director not quite capable of supporting such a risky tightrope act.__Throughout, its exhibitionist proclivities are evened-out under director Geoffrey Sax's astute guidance and the intelligent, nuanced performances of Berry and Skarsgard.__It's not just Frankie who is putting on a show here. Berry is also overemphatically showing off her chops.__This movie, with its flashbacks to past sins and traumas, rests squarely on Berry, a mesmerizer who makes every moment count.__A hokey old-school drama of multiple personality disorder based, in the tradition of The Three Faces of Eve and Sybil, on a real case study.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Pavich shows us many images from the storyboard, and even treats some to a simple form of animation to suggest how the movie might have looked.__This documentary version of Jodorowsky's "Dune" is probably more entertaining than what Hollywood would have done to it, with a clearer message: Our lives are like sands though an hourglass, so dream the impossible dream.__A deeply moving testament to single-minded, indefatigable commitment of creative vision and to an almost spiritual ability to let that vision go, thereby allowing it to exist in the world in an entirely unexpected form.__Jodorowsky is a mesmerizing presence in director Frank Pavich's engrossing picture. He was 84 when much of it was shot.__Jodorowsky's Dune gives you a good sense of what might have been, and judging by what we see, the picture might have accomplished what the director ultimately intended: "To mutate young minds."__What an extraordinary dream it could have been.__It leaves you wondering about how many artists are working on such wild dreams these days, and hoping it's more than you think.__It's an outstanding combination of genius and missed opportunities.__The best way to watch this movie is as an account of an eccentric visionary maverick who could not be stopped or influenced by reason ...__We get an idea of what could have been via the colossal illustrated screenplay still lovingly held by Jodorowsky, who is every bit the dreamer in his 80s that he was in his youth.__Is Alejandro Jodorowsky's "Dune" the most influential movie never made?__Employing a mix of lively talking-head interviews and trippy animation based on Jodorowsky's sketchbooks and storyboards, Frank Pavich's documentary paints a tantalizing picture of the movie that might have been.__Frank Savich's diverting documentary lets the 85-year-old filmmaker revisit a saga from the mid-'70s: his stellar two-year failure to adapt Frank Herbert's Dune for the screen.__A great seminar on creativity.__His stories feature an impressive roster of would-be collaborators (Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, H.R. Geiger, and Pink Floyd), and some of the set pieces he describes sound pretty neat.__Pavich's movie is more profound as a tribute to the imagination of visionary directors who can't realize their visions.__"Jodorowsky's Dune" is a lovely little tribute to a major league "What if?"__A fascinating and depressing documentary about a visionary director and his impossible dream.__Pavich is clearly in awe of Jodorowsky (who wouldn't be?), but he still treads a fine line between buying the director's notions of a spiritual quest at face value and soberly detailing said journey's particulars.__If you enjoy sci-fi, cult cinema, or messianic quests by quixotic lunatics, you will love this movie.
Beneath those puppet-headed antics, and true to its title, Frank is improbably, disarmingly honest.__With the soulful Gleeson and a sweetly menacing Fassbender (under a giant helmet-head) at its center, the movie never loses its acerbic edge or its oversize heart.__The whole thing is in danger of becoming arch and quirky, yet Abrahamson steers the final act of his drama toward a sombre, unhappy rumination.__"Frank" has a wry sense of humor, the ring of authenticity and glimmers of genuine wisdom.__There's a perseverance to "Frank" that's also uplifting, a true spirit of unity among the damaged.__Both Llewyn [Davis] and Frank may embody the spirit of the difficult musician, but Frank...is a more empathetic and engaging character, making Frank, the movie, a more bleakly funny yet ultimately touching film.__The movie's hipness quotient far outweighs its laugh quotient, though there's really no limit to the amusement of seeing someone bump around blindly in an oversize head.__A quirky, utterly engaging film that manages to be amusing, dark, surprising and poignant without wasting a single one of its 95 minutes.__A functioning, funny, weirdly touching fable of artistic angst and aspiration, a meditation on fame and its terrors and the metaphoric usefulness of masks and huge fake heads.__"Frank" is a true original, a film that heads in one direction only to veer off in another, yet never loses sight of where it's going.__The Soronprfbs may be the best fake on-screen punk band since the Stains.__A delightful, oddball surprise.__Odd, offbeat, somehow endearing, the bleakly comic "Frank" has its own kind of charm as well as some pointed, poignant things to say about the mysterious nature of creativity, where it comes from and where it might all go.__"Frank" might be a less cute movie without the mask but it would probably be a better one.__The movie roots the mask in mental illness without scanting Frank's artistic playfulness and power. The result is that rarity, a genuine pop tragicomedy.__Things go from cutesy to clever to grim, from the band's country shack to the road, and it takes too long to get everywhere.__In small movements - the twitch of a hand, a wobble under a door frame, a beer and straw held uselessly by his painted mouth - Fassbender gives us glimpses of what Frank's isolating genius has cost him.__"Frank" is a genuine original in a summer sea of sameness, and a darkly comedic manifesto against the cultural status quo.__As playful as it is, Lenny Abrahamson's film is mostly a surprisingly earnest story about the compromises and conflicts of art, stardom, and mental illness.__You're in for something funny, touching and vital. Director Lenny Abrahamson knows his way around eccentrics.
Much like the rusty jalopy in which the characters make their journey, Finding Fanny delivers a very bumpy ride.__Dimple Kapadia's prosthetic butt is emblematic of Homi Adajania's botched comedy, "Finding Fanny."__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
You spend a lot of the movie confused, but the great big reveals of its finale don't feel very shocking at all.__There's something welcome about a motion picture that doesn't hand out a dumbed-down resolution in a neatly wrapped package.__Eubank could have a terrific future as a director. As a screenwriter, though, maybe not so much.__There's bravura manipulativeness to The Signal, the stylish, slyly funny question mark of a movie from director and co-writer William Eubank.__The Signal is too ambitious for its own good, but it is still a pleasure to watch.__You wouldn't be surprised to see Mr. Eubank directing a bigger-budget movie down the road, but this film demonstrates some blanks in his approach that still need to be filled in.__A slow-starting but smart and deliciously weird sci-fi thriller ...__Let The Signal take you by surprise. And it will.__After a half an hour, the developments grow busy rather than mysterious, the focus blurs and the kicker ending - well, I was neither surprised nor satisfied.__It's fun while it lasts, though it feels less like a completed movie than a demonstration of director William Eubank's spooky ability to shift gears and string genres together.__Signal thinks big, takes chances and has enough arresting scenes to stand apart from the science fiction films of late.__A less than wholly satisfying destination, despite some fun detours.__It was made with great ingenuity and technical expertise on an exceedingly small budget. What's missing, however, is density, complexity and surprise.__Director William Eubank seems more concerned with building to an epic, superpowered ending rather than anything making a lick of sense. In the spirit of the characters and audience, though, it feels right.__The Signal doesn't bludgeon you in the manner of big-budget misfires like Transcendence -- it retains the appearance of freshness -- but it doesn't slake your thirst for story, either.__This sci-fi puzzler by cinematographer-turned-director William Eubank often recalls the work of Shane Carruth (Primer, Upstream Color) in its low-budget resourcefulness and creeping, gnawing paranoia.__There is no doubting Eubank's talent at bringing a story, one he co-wrote, to the screen.__Amid all the self-conscious virtuosity, certain things are right.__For a while, a little while, it seems like it just might be interesting.__Strong sci-fi grapples with its premise instead of concealing it.
A familiar yet compelling South Korean courtroom drama, propelled by Song Kang-ho's strong performance as an unlikely hero.__What makes writer-director Yang Woo-seok's feature debut special is how it handles this shocking incident with verve, style, and humor.__Every scene does its job, tears flowing on cue.__Just when a viewer is lulled into believing "The Attorney" is a lighthearted comedy about a doofus of a lawyer, this powerful South Korean feature takes a sharp turn toward brutal political thriller.__The Attorney features a powerful, energetic performance by Woo-Seok.__The movie is carried by its rousing pro- democracy message and a lively performance from the versatile leading man ...__"The Attorney" is on the side of justice, but it's a ham-fisted dramatization of real-life events that mistakes anger for persuasion.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A fairly predictable yarn that's lighthearted and well-acted, if cast mostly with characters that are little more than tackling dummies.__By-the-numbers inspirational trudgework.__Although the film has moments when it's serious about exploring the challenges that someone in Travis's situation faces, it ultimately prefers to be just another football movie with a hokey big-game ending.__Although the Bakers, and Hoovers' connection to small-town Kentucky lends the movie a sweet, homegrown touch, it's hard not to wonder whether it would've been more compelling (and less cheesy) in more experienced hands.__Another inspirational film that rarely strays from the playbook, but first-time director Baker gives it some life.__From the director to the actors, there's an ease with the style here, as well as a lack of self-consciousness about the fundamentalist religious culture of the characters.__It is a heartfelt, earnest piece of flatly lit Americana, made in a hypnotically dull style usually associated with mid-century industrial filmmaking.__Stepping behind the camera, versatile actor Dylan Baker makes an assured directorial debut, drawing spirited performances from his seasoned cast while mainly steering clear of the usual, treacly movie-of-the week conventions.__An honest piece of work, and sometimes a touching one.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Dom is effusive with self-destructive charisma, the kind of loose cannon you'd follow into an all-night bender in spite of your better judgment.__You don't so much care where Dom is going as how he's getting there, and he's getting there loud.__"Dom Hemingway" has two terrific things going for it: snappy dialogue (I was quite fond of the accusation "You disrespected my cat") and Law, who's both funny and scary in equal measures.__The title character of this florid crime comedy could be an escapee from a Tarantino script, all flashy character traits and verbal overkill.__Dom Hemingway is often viciously funny, and every time you think the movie has run out of steam, Shepard spins things in a new direction, keeping the energy from flagging (including one of the most startling car crashes I've ever seen in a film).__While Law bellows blasphemous poetry, his director orchestrates a noirish light show with a cockeyed rhythm.__Dom Hemingway suffers from a meandering narrative and inconsistent comedy.__The kind of crime flick where the characters volley dialogue like furious ping-pong players, riffing with delight, their lines ripe with pulpy metaphor.__"Dom Hemingway" isn't about story. It's about Jude Law as a force of nature, and that turns out to be a very entertaining diversion.__Shepard ... has his hero puff himself up, repeatedly, only to be drastically deflated, revealing the pitifulness of his braggadocio.__Dom's adventures make for a pretty thin garment in which to cloth such an outsize antihero.__The real star here is writer-director Richard Shepard, who pumps enough comic juice into the story to revive its shopworn premise of a career criminal hitting the streets again after years in the can.__Dom Hemingway is mainly a one-man show. But it's a hoot to watch Jude Law sink his teeth into such a despicable character ...__The material, limited payoff; the performer at the center, never less than arresting.__Law, saying farewell to his youthful good looks (Dom has scars and a little too much weight), makes this hyper-articulate ruffian the most intricately soulful character in current movies.__Dom Hemingway is an uneven movie, to be sure ... but it's still hard to resist.__The movie keeps crashing into crude shtick, cliche, and mawkishness.__An amusing tale of vengeance, debauchery and redemption told stylishly by writer-director Richard Shepard.__Almost every line is delivered with such overwrought bombast, just inches at times from the camera, you may feel a need to dodge the spittle.__Dom Hemingway is often ghoulishly funny, with Law, who put on weight for the role and plays up his receding hairline, turning in a larger-than-life performance unlike any he's given before.
Ethan and Sophie are never more than playthings of the premise; Moss and Duplass are the sole sources of nuance and vitality, and they seem unduly hemmed in by the movie's unimaginative confines.__Like figures in a funhouse that is both philosophical and phantasmagoric, the characters in "The One I Love" spook you, both inside your head and inside your heart.__"The One I Love" is a weird but gutsy exploration of what happens when we alternately idealize and find fault with our romantic partners.__Says more about intimacy and individuality than any romantic comedy or romantic tragedy in years.__"The One I Love" is an odd, unsettling and ultimately satisfying movie.__There is something slightly subversive and satisfyingly spot on when a movie about love and marriage turns on a solitary detail.__Fans of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits will particularly appreciate this blend of clever mystery, offbeat wit and a deeper-than-usual observational analysis of relationships and marital ennui.__Here's a date movie that will neither cozily cheer you nor satisfyingly thrill you, but instead leave you scratching your head.__One of those highly original films whose secrets are best experienced without much hint of what's to come.__First-time director Charlie McDowell and writer Justin Lader are skillful at subverting domestic-comedy cliches, and Moss and Duplass are superb at being tender, funny and borderline satiric.__"The One I Love" is diverting, but nothing catches fire, despite Ms. Moss, an amazing actress fast breaking free of the limits imposed on her by "Mad Men."__Director Charlie McDowell and screenwriter Justin Lader raise both smiles and pulses with their impressive feature debut, which never overplays its sneaky hand.__It begins by exploring how fantasy intrudes on and affects our perceptions of reality; it ends by trying too hard to convince us that its fantasies could, somehow, be real.__A clever amuse-bouche of a movie built around a conceit that can't be talked about in any detail...Let's just say it might have been something worthy of a Twilight Zone episode if Rod Serling were an indie filmmaker in the 21st century.__When the couple first realize what's going on, the husband immediately references The Twilight Zone, whose 26-minute time slot would have been more appropriate here.__Moss' combination of surface sweetness and watchful coldness - of studied placidity and cutthroat honesty - is right in line with the movie's aura. And Duplass brings in the comedy, in a performance that ranges from slapstick to menace.__Moss and Duplass are just about perfect in it, never begging for audience sympathy, merely working inside their characters for audience empathy. But this strikes me as a short film that has been blobbed out, uncertainly, to feature length.__If you survive that wrenching plot curve (some won't), you're in for an emotional workout. Knowing you've never seen anything like this, Moss and Duplass let it rip.__Lader's clever screenplay questions what people truly want and expect from their partners.__Like many movies that premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, "The One I Love" has plenty of story - for a 30-minute TV episode, in this case of "The Twilight Zone."
Wasikowska plays this wordless wanderer just right. That is, she makes her real.__What emerges here is a woman of remarkable strength, and a movie that doesn't sugarcoat the dark side of her journey ...__Curran's dreamy, semisurreal visuals, along with Mandy Walker's shimmering cinematography and Garth Stevenson's fluid score, help us see the world through Davidson's eyes.__[Curran] presents a vision of nature that shimmers with uncanny beauty and eerie solitude, transcended by Mia Wasikowska in one of the best performances of the year.__Director John Curran has a sense for visual grandeur. The landscape is ablaze with heat, dust, flies and a staggering loneliness. When a snake slithers across Davidson as she sleeps, you can almost feel its cold against the skin.__Ultimately the movie mimics the trajectory of the quest itself, pulling one toward its final destination, but across an arid expanse.__It all looks appropriately unglamorous, with Wasikowska wearing a layer of grime, her hair matted as she swats at ever-present flies. But the setting is spectacular.__Wasikowska here embodies Davidson with a mix of maniacal idealism and childish stubbornness that makes it seem her chin is perpetually stuck out at the world.__The dry sand, the swirling wind, the striking sight of Davidson framed against the enormous expanse - all draw us in and don't let us go.__More than a travelogue or a chronicle of self-willed solitude, director John Curran's gorgeous film version starring Mia Wasikowska betrays hardly a trace of Hollywood machinery in the storytelling.__Davidson's journey appears meaningless, little more than a succession of pretty vistas for the dirt-caked trekker to squint at while having flashbacks of her childhood.__The memoir is strongly written, and I wish that the movie, directed by John Curran (Marion Nelson did the adaptation), had more excitement to it.__Screenwriter Marion Nelson's overly expository dialogue reduces Robyn to an explorer-type daddy's girl we've met before, trudging diligently through the heat and dust, throwing off cliches.__Tracks is an exhilarating adventure that opens up an unknown world to most of us and does it so well that we feel we're living it too.__The story of a singular, go-it-alone young woman who's happiest away from people, and in the company of animals.__The desert trek in "Tracks" is as brutal as it is beautiful; the performance by Mia Wasikowska as raw as the reality. And the camels? If they don't steal your heart it must be stone-hinged.__Although I haven't read the book, the movie makes me want to do so by quoting judiciously from what is obviously distinctive writing.__Wasikowska makes for excellent company. We watch her mature from idealistic dreamer to a weary, hard-worn adventurer.__Despite the otherworldly scenery and some predictable tragedy - Robyn can be maddeningly careless about the welfare of her animals - this proves to be a rather logy amble.__A riveting adventure, as well as a dreamy meditative saga.
[Hossein Amini's] polished storytelling carries this along, generally compensating for the mundane visuals and the actors' skilled but unmoored performances.__At a certain point, it's akin to reading a mediocre murder mystery. You finish it because you're too far in to quit, as opposed to actually caring how things wrap up.__What the movie lacks in suspense, it could make up for with erotic tension. That's missing, too.__Everything about The Two Faces of January is right, even as the events it describes - a couple's idyllic Grecian holiday, a charming American's adventures abroad - go terribly wrong.__The movie never reaches a boil. Instead, it simmers and simmers until you're suddenly shocked at the hot water you're in.__Things get awfully twisted under that hot Mediterranean sun.__A stylish directorial debut for screenwriter Hossein Amini.__It follows three people, all of them flawed and under pressure, and keeps the audience in sympathy with all three. It's some kind of feat to place three people in conflict and have the audience wish the best for each of them.__It offers a lesson in crafting antiheroic characters. We don't have to identify with them, but we at least need to be intrigued.__You should see it just for Chester-the adventurous sham, running ever deeper into a maze of his own devising.__Gorgeous, occasionally evocative, but, in the end, mostly dull.__There are no jolting twists or shocking reveals. The reward lies mostly in accepting each character on his or her terms.__Perfectly fine - as chilly as a cold platter of octopus salad, as bracing as a shot of ouzo.__Even when the plot threatens to crumble, the actors know what to do with the pieces.__There's a mystery here, some thrills and blood, but mostly there are beautiful people and the kind of human hunger that devours everything and everyone in sight.__All the pieces would seem to be in place for an effective film, but the direction is zestless, the pace is more often laggardly than leisurely, and the lead performances are surprisingly lifeless ...__The Two Faces of January feels shot too tight and cut too tight; it doesn't push forward at a bewilderingly fast pace, but its story and its performances still feel like they need more room to breathe.__Is the film too old-school for short attention spans? Maybe. Rest assured that Amini's shuddery endgame is well worth the wait.__It lives or dies on its ending, and the final minutes here don't jibe with the rest of the film's cat-and-cat game.__January skirts by on its tastefulness and appreciation for the source material, however single-minded.
Authoritative and exhaustive. A must-watch.__The film is rich in archival-memory and first-person recollections of many key figures, of higher and lower or no rank at all.__There's nothing innovative in the filmmaking, it's simply a gracefully told story - tense here; poignant there - with strong detailing.__Archived film of the final, chaotic push to clear the embassy compound by helicopter is as dramatic as any thriller, heightened by stories of bravery and risk.__A testament to people, as one source puts it, "doing their best under terrible circumstances."__This is both a gripping suspense story and a profound moral drama.__"Last Days in Vietnam" will be broadcast in April on the long-running PBS series "American Experience." But it holds up on a bigger screen and deserves a large audience earlier than that.__A film of great sadness, but also a galvanizing depiction of heroism.__Sometimes the stories we think we know, the stories where we don't want to hear another word, turn out to be the most involving of all, the ones we in fact know the least about. So it is with "Last Days in Vietnam."__As a portrait of America in a moment both of idealism and betrayal, the movie is heartbreaking as well as inspiring.__Inspiring and thrilling.__"The Last Days in Vietnam," at its core, is about moral courage - the bravery to confront the question of "who goes and who gets left behind," as retired Army colonel Stuart Herrington puts it.__In sum, Last Days is the best kind of doc - it ties you up in knots.__One of the things that makes Kennedy's film so powerful is that it's not just a story of stupidity and tragedy and incompetence, although there's more than enough of those qualities to be found in the history of America's Vietnamese misadventure.__Perhaps the most striking thing about "Last Days in Vietnam," Rory Kennedy's eye-opening documentary about the 1975 evacuation of the American Embassy in Saigon, is how calmly it surveys what was once among the angriest topics in American political life.__"Last Days of Vietnam" is eerily foreboding for its implicit warnings to the fallout of political abandonment. But it's also, on a more micro level, inspiring. Even in failed wars, lives can be saved.__This fact-driven doc is eye-opening and at times thrilling. A sequence following a chopper pilot trying to get his family to an American aircraft carrier is like a short film unto itself.__It's not a documentary that reinvents the form or will alter anyone's perception of the war, but sometimes a rich, exhaustive chronicle is more than enough.__The grit of men and women scrambling desperately for freedom ahead of death and/or torture at the hands of the communists makes for a testament to human determination.__Riveting ...
This romantic-comedy roundelay gets better as it gradually moves away from comedy toward more sentimental material.__Adapting his TV series of the same name for this big-screen spinoff, Chen has an appealing visual style and deploys a sharp ensemble.__"Beijing" lurches and leaps past its better moments.__The movie wavers in tone, occasionally lurching into supernatural fantasy, and withholds information in a manner that's more annoying than tantalizing.__This nuance-free affair registers as little more than noise.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A well-paced story that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats as it bucks and rolls in unexpected directions to a bloody and satisfying climax.__Initially the late-80s setting of Cold in July registers as kitsch, but it grows more evocative as the Carpenter impersonation gives way to something weirder and uglier.__Hall does his best to make sense of Dane, but the plot turns simply don't add up. Good work in a not-so-good movie.__Pulp fiction doesn't come much better than Cold in July, a gritty, grisly - and perversely giddy - crime yarn directed by Pottstown-born indie-film provocateur Jim Mickle.__Unpredictable, progressively violent, with a knockout performance by Hall.__A tense, engrossing Texas thriller with a sense of humor as sharp and wounding as a Bowie knife.__It is a brutal, beautifully shot movie that starts out to be about revenge but then becomes something more, something even more primal and disturbing.__"Cold in July" has all the qualifications of a midnight movie in the making.__It doesn't cut too deep. But that can be a relief sometimes, and even a virtue.__These unique characters and performances breathe life into the moody world Mickle creates in this vivid, shocking thriller that sticks with you long afterward.__Mickle's bracing sense of style and cinematographer Ryan Samul's moody visuals keep it gripping until the final bullet is fired.__Strictly for connoisseurs of violent genre pulp.__A gritty, sweaty and entertaining little slice of Texas noir.__Mickle made one of the few excellent post-Romero zombie thrillers, Stake Land, and Cold in July is even more fun. He clearly relishes genre conventions and relishes even more turning them inside out.__A tangled tale of crime and punishment that mines the Lone Star lore of guns and killing.__As the movie's resident live wire, Mr. Johnson, obviously having the time of his life, is a hoot, and the feisty camaraderie among these three men gives "Cold in July" a euphoric goofiness.__Hall couldn't have picked a better role to definitively launch his post-Dexter career.__Movies incorporate plot twists all the time, but rarely with the mind-blowing relish of "Cold In July."__On the one hand, the movies hardly need yet more examinations of perceptions of masculinity. On the other, one as well-crafted and constantly surprising as Mickle's adaptation of Joe Lansdale's pulpy crime novel is hard to argue against.__Get ready to squirm. Be sure to seek out this twisty and terrific sleeper in theaters or on VOD. It's a real find.
Ms. Dore's work is not only a tribute to past bravery and determination, but also a warning and urgent rallying cry to the next wave.__Although much of that archival footage is incredibly familiar after decades of exposure - the burning bras, the clever protest signs, the impassioned speeches, Gloria Steinem - it's the footage of the opposition that really shocks.__The wealth of anecdotal material provides a fascinating perspective on how the movement intersected -- and sometimes clashed -- with other liberal crusades of the 60s.__It's a bubbling cauldron of newfound freedom and energy coming to life, an inspiring reminder of what people of a like mind and heart can accomplish. "She's Beautiful When She's Angry" is a thing of beauty indeed.__A superbly researched and edited documentary about the women's movement in the 1960s.__Dore's film should be seen. Take your daughters. And your sons.__Clearly fascinated with the era, its literature, its sit-ins and its ethos, Dore respects the film's still-passionate veterans, while noting some missed goals and flawed efforts to express their aims.__"She's Beautiful When She's Angry" doesn't break much formal ground. But it serves as a moving reminder of how crucial citizen action is in fomenting social change.__It's a useful documentary, and it needed to be made now.__A few awkward re-enactments mar the effect, but they're over quickly, while the narrators' voices and plentiful historical footage create a rich mosaic.__An exceptional chronicle, its mix of archival material and new interviews bristling with the energy and insight of one of the most important social movements of the 20th century.__It's rare in today's era of overstuffed nonfiction films that a documentary leaves you wanting more. But that's the case with Mary Dore's cheekily titled She's Beautiful When She's Angry.__This history might easily fill out a 12-part miniseries. It's to the credit of "She's Beautiful" that it seems neither hectic nor glib despite the enormous amounts of material that doubtless had to be excluded to fit a single feature's frame.__[A] fascinating historical documentary.__As filmmaking, "She's Beautiful" is meat and potatoes: It gets the job done without frills.__An urgent, illuminating dive into the headwaters of second-wave feminism, the movement that - no matter what its detractors insist - has given us the world in which we live.__This stirring and informative documentary about the rise of the women's movement in the United States, between 1966 and 1971, is an enticing blend of historical clips (most too brief) and interviews with many of the movement's leaders.__None__None__None
Puenzo's initial premise is more promising, though, than her sensational tone.__Quietly unnerving.__This curious, surprisingly safe melodrama fictionalises the postwar life of brutal Nazi surgeon Josef Mengele.__Puenzo masterfully balances the film's thriller edge with disturbing details about Mengele's obsession with genetic experimentation, as well as the community of German expatriates in Argentina helping old Nazis elude arrest.__Puenzo has a knack for plumbing the heads and hearts of teenage girls. The director coaxes a mesmerizing, unmannered performance out of Bado, who is making her feature-film debut.__The German Doctor is skillfully made and acted, but without any sense of spontaneity or surprise - qualities required for any decent thriller.__The German Doctor is both predictable and oppressive.__Amid the melodrama is a resonant, highly moral kind of horror movie.__'The German Doctor' is never showy or melodramatic - just a kind of true-life horror story about the helpful, soft-spoken monster in our midst.__The melodramatics in this movie may be cooked up, but the fears it conjures are very real.__The restraint Puenzo employs here is an assured and refreshing change of pace-especially given the horrific subject matter.__A credible imagining of a brief period in Mengele's South American exile. The what-if conceit is intriguing enough not to be undone by increasingly heavy-handed symbolism.__Like some extraterrestrial being who takes human form, Helmut is at once utterly familiar and utterly alien.__Puenzo paints an arresting picture of postwar Argentina as a strange, morally occluded place, with former Nazis hiding at the best watering holes and resorts and with Mossad agents working in the shadows.__Limited by a severely rigid metaphorical framework that requires every action and character to signify either uniformity (bad) or diversity (good).__Puenzo dramatizes her material with an overcooked sense of import that generates scant suspense, even once Israeli agents close in on their Nazi prey.__The sinister interest a Nazi physician takes in a 12-year-old girl and her family makes for a chilling, original tale.__A plodding Argentine potboiler.__None__None
Nothing exposes the pettiness of man's foibles quite like the beauty of the natural world, which almost always loses out in the end.__While The Pirates has its moments -- as when Yeo-wol and Jang bond late in the film -- little of it is compelling as comedy, drama or action. About the only thing The Pirates steal is time.__It's a derivative trove of swashbuckling action, romance, comedy, special effects and revisionist history - the kind of film that would be pitched to studio execs as "Pirates of the Caribbean" meets "Free Willy."__Neither the action nor the comedy in this action comedy is consistently strong.__"Pirates" is fun, though with a running time of more than two hours, it's overlong. And too many of its battle scenes are too dimly lit.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Like "Carnage," "The Pianist," "Rosemary's Baby" and more, Roman Polanski's latest is a creepy exploration of claustrophobia and perversity that should not be missed.__"Venus in Fur" is a stellar achievement.__Wickedly smart and wickedly playful, Roman Polanski's adaptation of David Ives' Tony-nominated Venus in Fur works on so many levels, it's almost dizzying.__Never underestimate Roman Polanski.__The haunted-house lighting is a perfect match for the claustrophobic intimacy of this two-hander - and camouflage, perhaps, for the fact that "Venus in Fur" remains more play than film.__Whether you like it or not, Roman Polanski is a great artist, and even the minor films of his fugitive decades glimmer with the claustrophobia and sardonic bleakness of his greatest work.__One thing that makes the dialogue-heavy movie so compelling (and also something that Polanski does so well) is an undercurrent of dread.__Pay attention to the camera, and you will see that Polanski is a clinician. He is in the thrall of no one.__The couple's movie-long pas de deux, during which time a reversal of roles takes place and the inner Thomas is exposed to the world (us), is staged with delicious irony and ingenuity by Mr. Polanski__[The] rare filmed theater piece that leaves you smiling, thinking, and maybe a bit hot and bothered, to boot.__The film has a creepy allure but, as movies featuring full-bore sexual gamesmanship often do, it wears thin.__"Venus in Fur," a whip-smart dissection of gender politics via some teasing S&M, is arch. So arch in fact that it is surprising it's a Roman Polanski film.__Ever the alchemist, Roman Polanski continues his quest for the process whereby theatre is transmuted and reforged into film.__Roman Polanski's been making films about psycho-sexual mind games for decades, and when his opening shot poses his stage director next to a very phallic cactus, you know he's at it again.__If you didn't see the play onstage and don't know what you're missing, this Venus in Fur has its demonic, masochistic charms.__Polanski's direction of his performers is assured. His camerawork is precise. And the power games - moving, shifting, constantly surprising and inescapably, queasily conflating art and artist - hold us in their thrall.__What is surprising is how little Polanski juices the material with his usual devilish touch.__One of the delights of Mr. Ives's play, and of Mr. Polanski's nimble rendering of it, is the way it jumps in and out of the play within.__An exercise in moviegoing pain.__Roman Polanski. Sadomasochism. What could possibly go wrong?
The shifting tones keep the movie both buoyant and firmly grounded, and playing out in a sphere pitched somewhere between the mythic and the muddy.__A tough rural drama by David Gordon Green that digs deep in all the right ways.__It's young Sheridan's Gary who makes the film work, with his mix of earnest ambition, stubborn courage and hopeful endurance. He gives "Joe" the honesty it needs.__A small-scale, expertly acted character study in which Cage plays an ex-con trying to make a quiet living in a backwater Texas town and trying, above all, to keep certain troublesome character tendencies in check.__What happens along the way isn't particularly surprising to those familiar with Southern gothic sensibilities. But if the path is predictable, the acting is not.__For Nicolas Cage, whose dumb, rant-for-hire projects have lately been making audiences forget how good he can be, Joe is more than a rescue - it's a re-birth.__The film belongs to Cage. You can feel his compassion as Joe defies the reduced options of his life. There's not an unfelt moment in Cage's performance. Or in the movie.__"Joe" ties up the audience emotionally.__This world feels studied in its "authenticity": the rusted GMC pickup, the tumbledown shack, the boozy brothel, and angry Joe Ransom guttin' deer and tending to his own gunshot wounds with a grimace and a bottle of alcohol.__Gripping and at times agonizing.__If you've missed Nicolas Cage and the special qualities he brings to movies, "Joe" is a good place to get reacquainted.__Poulter's intensity matches Cage's, note for note. The frightening verisimilitude of his portrayal lends the film a cinema verite realism that nicely mutes some of Cage's star power.__Though "Joe" occasionally slips and falters, the filmmakers and actors get all the hard-luck details right. Besides, it's nice to see its star out of the cage for a change.__Whatever you call it, it's not quite right.__Nicolas Cage and Tye Sheridan can't save this story -- about a righteous ex-con becoming the surrogate father to an abused boy -- from turning into an exercise in rural wretchedness.__Mr. Cage gives his most committed performance in years as this divided soul, but it still looks like acting when compared with Mr. Poulter's embodiment of pure evil.__Cage surprises you with his portrayal of a man who doesn't care whether the world likes him but discovers he's capable of taking an interest in someone who desperately needs help but can't bring himself to ask.__While Green deftly brings us into this small Texas town, perfectly capturing its inhabitants and their humid surroundings, the script by Gary Hawkins (adapting the novel by Larry Brown) overplays its hand.__"Joe" is not handsome or especially smart, but like its namesake, the film has enough rough humor and respect for hard work to qualify as average.__The characters are rich and round with human contradictions. Joe, despite his police rap sheet and outlaw temperament, has a core of tenderness and humor.
This gripping Palestinian thriller evokes Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers in its depiction of not only the psychological pressures faced by people under occupation, but the murky moral consequences of retaliating.__It's told with a stark, pitiless clarity that leaves you with fewer answers than before.__Omar is romance and thriller. Of course, trust is at the heart of the matter.__A fraught film ...__Abu-Assad offers no solutions here. Instead he paints a portrait of the daily rhythms of the occupation, an endless conflict that has seeped into every aspect of life in the West Bank.__The film works best as a straightforward melodrama set in an anything but straightforward world.__Abu-Assad has created a convincingly noirish hell that feeds on distrust and vengeance.__The somber Omar isn't as controversial as Paradise Now but it too gets behind the TV news bulletins to discreetly put a human face on what is often just more electronic noise. Sometimes it's the quietest voices that are really the loudest.__Abu-Assad does a masterful job of showing, in these seemingly hopeless circumstances, the fragility of life.__A story of love and betrayal set against political tumult and violence in Palestine, "Omar" is both classic and painfully present in its concerns.__Abu-Assad's tale is less a political thriller than it is a human story - although everything about its setting and circumstances is defined by oppression, surveillance, restriction, and control.__A tender love story, a haunting tragedy and an expertly crafted thriller with flawed, damaged and not entirely likable characters.__It is difficult to figure out which is the film's more pressing theme - the power of love to change the course of a life, or the political and social realities of living in occupied territory.__It's the sort of film that feels so authentic that even knowing it's a fiction, the morning after seeing it, I found myself scanning headlines to see if there were any new developments.__"Omar" does not offer the promise of a just or satisfying resolution, a fatalism all the more devastating given its realistic methods and humane, understated performances.__I don't want to see the characters as freedom fighters or terrorists. I just want to see them as human beings. But the director uses them as political magnets to draw us toward his ideological sympathies.__Bakri, a relative newcomer to the big screen, does a superb job of carrying a film in which he appears in nearly every scene.__A riveting blend of thriller and romance elements, "Omar" grabs you from the very first image.__"Omar" is a real thriller, a snake pit of plot twists, in which the perspectives shift, destinations change and the moral universe spins and sways.__The movie grips us partly because Bakri's performance is alternately casual and calculated.
The Face of Love's story runs and blotches like cheap mascara.__Many are going to find the plot questionable and the protagonist's actions deplorable. But for those who've experienced loss and grief that seems irreparable, it is a film that will strike a deep and melancholy chord.__Old age, romance, grief, delusion and desperation all intersect in "The Face of Love," a far-fetched tale that nevertheless manages to be affecting.__What's mesmerizing here is what happens in Bening's eyes, in her complicated smiles, in her eloquent quiet.__Bening and Harris are great actors, and they fill their roles as completely as they can, given the limitations of the soggy and implausible script by Matthew McDuffie and director Arie Posin.__Like so much about this film, the finale hints at Hitchcock but settles for soap opera.__A Lifetime Channel-like meditation on grief and moving on ...__The only thrill, and it's worth the price of admission, is Bening.__The first ten minutes of The Face of Love function as what might be called a statement of purposelessness, announcing exactly how and why the movie will be bad.__"The Face of Love" needs further fleshing out.__"The Face of Love" is patchy, but it raises such fascinating questions that it deserves to be seen.__A weak-tea version of "Vertigo" in which contrivances abound.__"The Face of Love" is marred by false conflicts and by characters violating their own internal logic - the latter problem becomes particularly acute as the movie wears on.__It's a maudlin, superficial exercise in obsession masquerading as a heartfelt romance and study of grief, and character development is sorely lacking.__Ms. Bening ... immediately [makes] this woman come so satisfyingly alive, breathing believable vitality and at times contradictory emotions into what might have otherwise registered as a blur or cliche.__Rather than indulging the weird Sirkian "Vertigo" (minus the murder plot) nipping at the edges, director and co-writer Arie Posin regrettably sticks to the tastefully designed, artless tear-jerker.__The premise is, at once, too much and not enough. It's too much for these filmmakers to handle.__Workmanlike and unambitious, presuming that a story and a string score are enough to carry a movie.__It's the wonderful performances by Bening and Harris that make this flawed, somewhat maudlin film worth seeing.__It sounds turgid, but it's a fine example of how two great actors can lift questionable material beyond its limitations. The premise is unlikely, but every time it edges uncomfortably in the direction of soap opera, they rescue it, making you care.
A hip-looking mess of a movie, made tolerable by Benjamin's spacey-cool Hendrix. Great costumes, few insights.__It's a risky approach that's bound to frustrate many folks, but it's also quite illuminating in its own way.__You can sense the movie's desire to break free of the demands of the rock biopic, but you can also sense it constantly being pulled back.__Thanks to Benjamin's performance and the unique quality of the subject itself, the movie's hard to dismiss.__A flawed, ambitious and deeply peculiar portrait of one of the 20th century's most enigmatic musical talents, in the year before he ascended to rock-god status, that resembles no other pop-music biopic you've ever seen.__Benjamin captures Hendrix's nodding swagger, his effortless cool, and most important, his voice - going beyond mimicry into some other, spookier realm.__The film's own spontaneous experimentation provides dazzling context for the musician's impact on the world.__Most of the action occurs below the surface -- genius giving birth to ideas, ambition crystallizing into action -- and, at times, Ridley's direction evokes the inner life with subtle invention.__One reason "All Is by My Side" works is that the story - with its girl, guy, guitar and revolution - is enjoyable, whether it's precisely true or not.__None of Jimi Hendrix's classic music found its way into "Jimi: All Is By My Side," but that doesn't hurt this moody, mesmerizing film one bit.__A strangely lethargic and self-consciously arty trudge that struggles to find a narrative through-line or turn the great Hendrix into a vivid personality.__There's no doubt that Andre Benjamin is the film's magnetic core. His silky-voiced, dangerously volatile turn as Jimi Hendrix is a star-spangled triumph.__Liberated from playing the hits, Benjamin eloquently captures Hendrix's emerging style without having to succumb to jukebox-musical opportunism.__"Jimi: All Is by My Side" manages to keep an aura of mystery while letting us see the inspiration.__[Benjamin's] mesmerizing work saves this unique and somewhat controversial new biopic from a level of entirely un-Jimi-like mediocrity.__Andre Benjamin, from OutKast, is perfect as Hendrix, nailing his look (the teased-out nimbus of hair and groovy Carnaby Street threads) as well as his space-cadet cadences, his selfish dark side, and the way he comes alive on stage.__To really understand Hendrix, Ridley would have had to reach much farther back.__Think of a famous Hendrix song. For that matter, think of an obscure Hendrix song. Whatever you're thinking of, it's not in the movie. That's a little like making a film about Henry Ford without ever showing a car.__Ridley doesn't present Hendrix's ascension to guitar god in conventional fashion, which is both an interesting and at times frustrating decision.__Jimi Hendrix: All Is By My Side knows the pitfalls of musician biopics that cram a lifetime into a formula, and it knows that musicians are more than just their hit songs. It also dissects Hendrix into such thin slices that it's hard to see him at all.
Cahill spends the entire film bringing a sense of wonder to the desperately rational Ian, and if the film takes on a glow toward the end, that glow feels well-earned.__I Origins challenges too little and ties up things too neatly for it to register as anything more than well-made, well-intentioned hogwash.__Big ideas can sometimes lead to great motion pictures or, as in the case of I Origins, colossal misfires.__With a slew of seemingly random clues unraveling in the pursuit of scientific mystery, Origins becomes gut-punching marvel.__Although the film and the actors keep on looking good, this solemn, soppy, fantasy has nothing to say about science or faith.__Cahill is one of the most talented filmmakers to emerge in the last decade. His sophomore feature may disappoint, but it's clear he has much more to say.__The very idea of a dishy man of science being bowled over by the mysteries of the soul is quite irresistible, and Pitt and Marling really sell the plot's implausible twists.__This is a beautifully crafted story that takes us on quite the journey of exploration and discovery.__The film doesn't rush to solve the mystery of whether Ian the skeptic is discovering a new realm of spiritual activity or merely grasping at coincidence and magical thinking.__Makes a too obvious attempt to repeat [Cahill's] previous effort, wanting to be spooky and ending up soggy.__"I Origins" slows down the longer it goes on, and the last half hour drifts into vagueness. The climax is dramatically inert and depends on the soundtrack to convince us that it's actually happening.__The film ends with an ambiguous, yet powerful conclusion. It doesn't answer the question it raises, yet the way it's asked keeps it echoing in your head.__How much you enjoy "I Origins" may well depend on whether you think lines like "Maybe the eye really is a window to the soul" are cliched.__Despite the post-doctoral double-talk in "I Origins," the movie's faith remains in the mysteries of the cosmos, and it all starts to feel a little wet.__Captivating, suspenseful and thought-provoking.__The cinematography by Markus Forderer is dreamy and memorable, even if the science in I Origins feels a tad half baked, even to the unschooled.__Mike Cahill's movies are categorized as science fiction, but the scientific elements in them are subsidiary to his characters and, more importantly, his metaphysical concerns.__"I Origins" has the genetic markers of a formulaic supernatural thriller, and it's marred by some muddy metaphysics and fuzzy science, but the beauty is in the details.__Writer-director Mike Cahill, who can be a bit too fancy with the camera, delivers a lot of deep-dish philosophizing with a minimum of cant.__There are occasional flashes of the exceptional, but the film's dodgy story can't sustain them.
If you've seen any of Koreeda's previous films, and especially the wrenching children-alone saga Nobody Knows, it won't surprise you to learn that the observation of children in Like Father, Like Son is unfailingly acute ...__Koreeda's film never feels gimmicky; he uses the situation to examine both nature and nurture while dealing with ties that simply can't be broken. "Like Father, Like Son" ponders the meaning of family.__Writer and director Hirokazu Koreeda does not pretend that there are easy answers in his film, which at times plays almost like a fable. But the emotions and heartbreak are always grounded in reality.__If you've seen Hirokazu Koreeda's films - Nobody Knows, Still Life, I Wish - then just the announcement that a new one, Like Father, Like Son, has arrived is all you need to know.__A moving drama about parenthood from Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda.__A deeply affecting Japanese family tale from Hirokazu Kore-eda, renowned for his films about parents, children, blood bonds and loss.__A bittersweet musing about the nature of parenthood and about the conflict between nature and nurture, it is as banal and insightful as its title.__In general, the speed and stoicism with which Keita and Ryusei adjust to the familial maneuvering is, quite frankly, weird.__[Kore-eda] pokes some fun at class differences, but his overall aim is serious - we get a powerful sense of how unsettling it would be to live through such a wrenching event. Remarkably, he conveys this with charm and restraint.__[A] moving drama, one of the best to date from Japanese writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda.__Like Father, Like Son is always wise about the quandary faced by the two fathers and the two mothers.__The movie is so predictable that it might have played better as a domestic comedy about an odd couple of dads.__Wry, funny and wise, like most of the work of Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda.__What stays with you ... is the unlikely shadow of loss, not least in the hearts of the boys' mothers: how can a loving child, even the "wrong" one, be let go?__Follows [a] pattern fairly predictably at first, then transcends it with tenderness, humor and exquisite depth of feeling.__Its children-switched-at-birth story sounds schematic, but what we see on screen is both meaningful and deeply moving.__The questions posed by Like Father, Like Son are universal in nature and the manner in which Kore-eda addresses them makes for superior drama.__At times like this, Like Father, Like Son ascends to dizzying emotional heights.__Little Keita Ninomiya plays Keita with such tenderness, while Fukuyama makes Ryota harsh at first, and fills in each step of the man's progress with precision.__Mr. Hirokazu again creates a pair of irresistible charmers whose lives are, with increasing emotional violence, upended ... by the very adults meant to take care of them.
One of the many pleasures of director Adam Wingard's tough, fun thriller "The Guest" is seeing Matthew Crawley -- er, British actor Dan Stevens -- serve up a mesmerizing star turn of psycho charm.__A slow-burn approach seems to pose a challenging change-up for the filmmakers, who struggle to build tension as the second acts stretches well past the point when the level of menace should be escalating.__Wickedly entertaining.__It's not a particularly brilliant conceit, but, not unlike Stevens's beautifully one-note performance, it's evocative nevertheless -- lending the whole movie an aura of pop inevitability, turning its blunt predictability into something of a virtue.__The Guest borrows from other genre pictures with such intelligence and clarity of purpose, it manages to feel fresh, exciting.__The pleasures of The Guest lie mainly in anticipating how the next expected corner will be turned.__Nothing can stop the wicked smoulder of Stevens, who makes a smile seem like a weapon of mass destruction.__The Guest ravels smartly; and, after too many herky-jerky entries in the faux-found-footage subgenre, it's nice to see a scare film with a pearly visual style, which gives the enterprise the patina of both elegance and plausibility.__"The Guest" remains watchable through the finish, but all pretense that this is some kind of attempt at a good movie goes out the window after the first hour.__The director Adam Wingard joins the ranks of the current masters of unease with this suspenseful horror tale.__The crazier the movie gets, the better it is -- the climax is set in a homemade fun house complete with billowing artificial fog, and it works first as comedy, then as mild suspense, and, finally, as surprise.__The Guest isn't here to deliver an earnest social message about the state of veterans' affairs. Instead, the way good horror movies do, it channels our collective fear, guilt, and rage by creating a monster.__Dan Stevens is mesmerizing as the avenger, helping director Adam Wingard turn The Guest into a blast of wicked mirth and malice.__The Guest transcends the genre with characters who could have come out of a more serious movie. When they're in peril, we actually care.__To note that "The Guest" is not for everyone is to belabor the obvious. But for fans of smart, well-made horror, it's a treat.__That's a familiar setup, but Barrett and Wingard take it in one unexpected direction after another, displaying obvious pleasure in their mad dash to keep topping themselves.__An '80s style action thriller that turns out to be more suspenseful and keenly plotted than most, with a compelling centerpiece performance by Dan Stevens (Downton Abbey) that deserves attention.__For much of its running time, "The Guest" plays an interesting guessing game with the audience.__Dumb fun is rarely this smartly delivered.__Yes, it's all just a regurgitation of murder machine tropes - right up to the very end shot - but as regurgitations go, "The Guest" is fine, sick fun.
Chiemi Karasawa deserves all the credit in the world for the intimate and hilarious portrait that is Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me, a sparkling cocktail of music and memoir. On the other hand, she didn't exactly have to drag her subject out of her shell.__[A] feisty portrait of the musical-theater legend.__"Elaine Stritch" is filled with bluster and memories, blunt outbursts and funny moments. But more importantly, it is filled with honesty.__Elaine Stritch's strength, along with the film's, comes from her honesty. She is herself, even when - maybe especially when - she knows she's being watched.__What a tough, difficult, talented old broad.__Really, the experience of "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me" is the experience of being in Stritch's company for 80 minutes, and that's fine. Still I doubt anyone will walk out of this film wishing it were 10 minutes longer.__By the end, even those who had never heard of Stritch can share her rage against the dying of the light.__An enjoyably fawning documentary.__This is a must-see for anyone who loves theater, acting and especially individuals like Elaine Stritch unafraid to bare their souls -- so all of us can gain more insight into the complicated essence of the human condition.__Stritch, in her trademark billowy white blouses and skinny black tights, or in bed, without makeup and without, sometimes, a lucid notion, reveals herself to be full of opposing emotions and desires.__This profile of stage and screen veteran Elaine Stritch, shot during her 87th year, isn't a documentary so much as an improvised star vehicle; she plays to the camera through the entire movie and puts on a hell of a show.__You watch "Shoot Me" wishing this woman could keep sashaying through her showbiz life forever ...__The movie's a portrait of tough yet vulnerable woman fighting age with everything she's got, giving in, getting scared, fighting some more.__Formidable, indomitable, irascible: Pick your adjective, and it pretty much describes the force of nature who holds the stage in "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me."__"I Feel Pretty," from "West Side Story," was written for an ingenue, not a grande dame in her ninth decade, but she sings it with delicious irony, self-irony and irrepressible delight.__I suppose it helps to have seen Stritch onstage to fully appreciate the bracing new documentary "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me," released by Sundance Selects. I wish I'd seen more.__She is more than a little abrasive in the finished documentary, yet she is also compulsively watchable. No wonder she's a star.__One of those showbiz docs that's not exactly pleasurable but offers a penetrating glimpse - sometimes too penetrating - into what it means to eat, drink, and be contrary in the public sphere.__Follows the groundwork laid out by the recent Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work, alternating between look-where-she's-been historical footage and look-at-her-go glimpses of her current busy schedule.__Cheers to a movie as gloriously entertaining and bluntly honest as the lady herself. Everybody rise.
"Volume II" is no more fulfilling than "Volume I."__It's very weird, given, but it's also effective.__For better or worse, the whole exercise in lurid leg-pulling goes out with a bang.__The Lars von Trier you know and love (or love to hate) is back: cynical, misanthropic, punishing.__The movie, a descendant of such eighteenth-century libertine texts as "Therese Philosophe," is less a slice of life than something told and chewed over.__A notch more watchable than Volume I.__Von Trier is such a masterful filmmaker that every new project comes on with the expectation and air of a totalizing masterwork. "Nymphomaniac: Volume II" creates the unsated sensation of having too much and wanting more.__True, von Trier films all the ugliness beautifully - with occasional breaks for mystic images, and bad jokes. But to what point?__A long plod ...__The problem with "Nymphomaniac: Volume II" lies not in its display of erect penises and reddened buttocks, but rather in its dull narrative and overworked ideas.__No one has ever made sex look like less fun.__This is a frustrating, fundamentally flawed movie, but if one must consider it two separate animals, this latter one is demonstrably better.__Misery loves company, and no one loves both more than this director.__"Vol. I" works. "Vol. II" works you over, and von Trier likes it like that.__There's no doubt that von Trier knows how to deploy cinematic language for maximum effect - he is, quite simply, a superb filmmaker. But in this case, he confuses challenging audiences with simply leaving them in the dark.__Here we go again.__This episode includes so many lavish close-ups of bloody flesh that it seems as if Von Trier is making a "Saw" film.__The shocker ending struck me as both gimmicky and ill motivated, but up until then this confirms von Trier as the cinema's most accomplished provocateur, turning his attention here to the eternal conflict between pleasure and morality__This is a good movie, but it lacks the visual wonder of the first, along with the sense of play at which von Trier, even at his most controversial, is so good.__The "Nymphomaniac" films are an artistic dead-end for Von Trier. He is most certainly feeling something, but he's short-circuiting his own emotion, rather than digging into it.
A stunning minimalist erotic thriller that explores with arresting photography and economical use of dialogue how human identity is defined, and sometimes imprisoned, by our desires, drives, and passions.__Carefully and often brilliantly creates its own Eden-like universe.__There's too much metaphysical packaging material in the story; it's half Styrofoam peanuts. But its ideas are intriguing and its murky suspense is undeniable.__What sets the engrossing "Stranger by the Lake" apart is that its excesses seem to point to a moral purpose beyond shock or entertainment value.__A simple and ruthlessly effective exercise in minimal narrative and style, Alain Guiraudie's moral tale is so restrained and atmospheric that the nudity and graphic sex don't upstage the creepy mood of seductive, inescapable doom.__This lake is a sexual refuge, about to be stained by sin and blood.__Movies must go somewhere, plots must always kick in, and when this one does, that's where "Stranger by the Lake" begins to contract into something less creative than its odd setting and compelling compositions would suggest.__French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie's tantalizingly erotic fable of love, passion and death.__Writer-director Alain Guiraudie has an imagistic talent for suspense and erotic byplay.__The film is a Hitchcockian murder story in which the Hitchcockian elements-style as well as content-are stood on their heads in order to realize a philosophical vision that's no less sophisticated than Hitchcock's own.__The kind of taut, low-key thriller that Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock would very much admire.__So much of this beguiling film's beauty is in how it sneaks up on you, the way genre elements quietly insinuate their way into the story.__A cautionary tale about finding love with an improper stranger.__"Stranger by the Lake" is seductive and fascinating, but it is also a bit trapped in its own conceit, and in its carefully maintained emotional detachment.__A psychosexually intriguing blend of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and William Friedkin's Cruising ...__Like his characters, [director Alain] Guiraudie is walking a tightrope, finding the point where sex and death exude a similar allure. You won't be able to look away.__The film's circumscribed scope is simultaneously its most intriguing and most limiting factor.__From a single setting, a lakeside gay cruising spot, and an old theme - the link between sex and death - Alain Guiraudie constructs an intricate film.__A murderous love story whose serene setting hides a darker purpose.__An absorbing and intelligent exploration of queer desire spiced up with thriller elements after one of the studly nudists goes missing.
[Deneuve] conveys in every scene a convincing and touching openness to life as experienced in the moment.__Deneuve, fine as always, subtly emphasizes the character's self-destructive side, providing a little medicine to help the sugar go down.__You can tell Deneuve is relishing the chance to play not a great beauty, not a national legend, but a simple, human basket case - a woman who has been her own worst enemy for so long that she's ready to give up the fight.__A droll if minor dramatic comedy about a woman who goes out for a pack of smokes and ends up on an odyssey of self-discovery through the back roads and tiny villages of rural France.__These series of vignettes still leave an impression, thanks in no small part to Deneuve.__"On My Way" finds Deneuve warm and natural, completely open and yet subtle, able to suggest much with little, allowing us to read her thoughts.__Deneuve was 70 when she made this film, and Bercot draws on everything we know about her as an actress and as an icon.__Writer-director Emmanuelle Bercot certainly hits a lot of notes along the way, playing neither dark nor light in full, traipsing through family dysfunction and betrayed love with both mortality and a smile ever overhead.__Emmanuelle Bercot's agreeably ambling feature celebrates the inimitable Deneuve-ness of her leading lady, whose character, Bettie, appears in every scene.__A handsome vehicle for Denueve, who drives it with elegant sanfroid.__Disappointingly tedious, On My Way is a contrived vehicle for Gallic icon Catherine Deneuve.__It's a slight film which very much depends on the fond affection engendered in audiences by its star. Luckily that's still in ample supply.__Just when "On My Way" seems about to be stranded in the middle of nowhere, Bettie and Charly's fraught relationship gives the movie an emotional center and comedic drive.__The movie has a soundtrack full of pop delights and a loose-limbed way of making itself up as it goes along.__Predictable as the adventure may be, the company - and the countryside - make it worthwhile.__This isn't the kind of movie that's in a hurry to get anywhere in particular. Still, there's no need for the journey to be quite so blah.__Watching Bettie get her groove back, it's easy to think that of course she still has men in their 30s chasing her. She's Catherine Deneuve, for heaven's sake.__Finally, a movie about Catherine Deneuve driving around the French countryside!__It manages to be a mildly merry film in any case, because its realism is patient and inclusive ...__None
A vivid up-close view of the travails of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.__Mr. Boettcher knew those men, puts faces to their names. As he says, every soldier's story is different, and they all bear telling.__"The Hornet's Nest" is a kinetic, immersive experience, particularly in its deeply felt human moments.__It's a thrilling you-are-there war movie, with incredible images from the middle of firefights, mixed with the story of a father and son trying to reconnect.__The moving documentary The Hornet's Nest is a boots-on-the-ground look at America's war in Afghanistan.__We're not suggesting that this film is going to drive A-list actors and directors out of the war-movie business. But The Hornet's Nest might push them to change what they do in the name of realism.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Regardless of background, sophistication or home country, the kids all share a lovely sense of open-heartedness. They all talk about being part of a collective, and see the human race as a large extended family.__What emerges is a group of kids who are generally content but must confront the often confusing time between childhood and adolescence.__An enjoyable mishmash of young voices and faces poised between childhood and teenagerdom.__A smart, enjoyable portrait.__The project could easily have seemed like a smarmy Nickelodeon special or some variant of "Kids Say the Darndest Things," but Ms. Bailey's willingness to let the children talk and to let the viewer impose broader meaning elevates it.__The feature-length film ultimately becomes repetitive, with the lack of contextual information about the subjects' lives rendering the proceedings shallow.__Bailey resists sentimentality. She also revisits some children when they get older, which gives her film an echo of Michael Apted's "7 Up" series. This one, though, is stunning in its own right.__Heaped together into a feature, these brief introductions prove frustrating, unrevealing of any greater truth, and weighed down by the soundtrack's jaunty ukuleles ...__Docu's only slight blemish is some repetitive testimony. Tech aspects are fine.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Flatly told and highly familiar.__Its refreshing conclusion is more suited to ambiguous European sensibilities than the all-American desire for happy endings or at least concrete resolutions ...__There is a warm naturalness to the dialogue, and Buy is wonderfully evocative.__A frothy romantic comedy tinged with melancholy and yearning.__One of those rambling European films with little plot but lots of atmosphere ...__This Italian romantic dramedy needs a little room service, because the romance, comedy and drama are sometimes in short supply.__The final destination of "A Five Star Life" is well worth the wait, but the service is so slow that some viewers may check out early.__Putting her seemingly content protagonist through very low-key emotional crises, director Maria Sole Tognazzi gently explores what it means to be unmarried, middle-aged and female.__Maria Sole Tognazzi's romantic comedy proves more effective as a resort showcase than as an emotionally involving narrative.__You won't find much heft in Maria Sole Tognazzi's Italian dramedy, but it'll make for a decent mini-vacation if you could use a brief escape.__Narratively and emotionally, this weirdly becalmed trifle by Maria Sole Tognazzi ends up almost exactly where it started.__Tognazzi shoots her material with stately grace but a distinct lack of energy, which is also true of Buy's composed but inert lead performance.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Innocence, adapted from Jane Mendelsohn's novel, boasts a wicked setup, some strong performances, several gloriously bloody spook-out images, and a movie-wrecking hypoglycemic listlessness.__A movie of such snowballing stupidity that it's a wonder the actors could keep straight faces while shooting it (outtakes, please!).__Takes a machine-gun approach to filmmaking, spraying the audience with as many genres, storylines, themes, and cliches as possible, hoping one will stick.__There's not much of a payoff, as this tepid film telegraphs its mild punches from several miles away.__When you consider the source material, the film's flaws become too great to ignore.__Moves to the formulaic beats of the second-rate TV movie, albeit one cloaked in an ultra-glossy sheen.__A messy if sporadically entertaining horror thriller based on a well-received novel by Jane Mendelsohn.__It's an idea that could make for decent genre viewing, if only its cast had some range, and its indie reach didn't exceed its mainstream-polished grasp.__The film is ridiculous without being enjoyably campy.__If this nonsense is the stuff of nightmares for most modern teenage girls, who seem genetically predisposed to roll their eyes at anything a parent or teacher does, I'd be very surprised.__Sadly, the movie is weakly paced and sinister only when Pamela coos oh-so-sympathetically in people's ears.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Say this about the godfather of midnight movies, Alejandro Jodorowsky: He loves a parade and he puts on a doozy__A lot of the film doesn't quite click, either as dream imagery or something more conventional. But there's a spirit and a yearning in it that's undeniable and bracing.__Part of the dance in "The Dance of Reality" is between one's own destiny and uncontrollable forces.__The Dance of Reality, which deserves a place alongside Amarcord as a fantastical take on coming of age, is the work of a wise and experienced old soul with the passion and curiosity of a young man.__Jodorowsky's images can be stunning, and his ability to acknowledge pain without being depressing is a rare gift. The film is a wayward dream but well worth embracing.__Despite its many flaws, this is a major work that deserves attention.__It makes sense, in the way that a nightmare makes sense.__Whatever childhood traumas Jodorowsky may need to exorcise are ultimately subsumed by the movie's wild invention and carnivalesque cheer.__The filmmaker's novel approach to memoir deserves a wider audience. Maybe everything has been done before, but never quite like this.__It may hold some interest to cinephiles as a relic of a kind of extravagant, overheated personal cinema that doesn't exist anymore.__This is a stirring and strange mix of history, memory, and fantasy.__Something very close to a masterpiece.__Proof that the legendary provocateur is still a font of out-there invention.__A film with an imagination as big as its heart - which is mighty grand, and more powerful than authoritarianism.__Jodorowsky's first movie in 23 years, and the best thing he's done, film-wise, since The Holy Mountain.__[Jodorowsky's] newfound focus is personal and political, and the vibrant result signals a major talent with plenty more to show us.__The Dance of Reality may be Alejandro Jodorowsky's best film, and certainly, in a filmography top-heavy with freak-show hyperbole and symbology stew, the one most invested in narrative meaning.__A minor success from a major figure.__Nostalgia and narcissism from a cinematic Grand Master.__By turns playful, tragic and surprisingly light on its feet, this welcome comeback for Alejandro Jodorowsky should keep its maker fully booked on the fest circuit.
"Antarctica" ultimately does evoke a sense of the place - its magnificent emptiness and inhuman, unspoiled purity.__It is the simple glimpses of ordinary life in an extraordinary place that are the most stirring moments in the film.__Powell makes excellent use of time-lapse photography to capture such natural phenomena as a sea freezing over. What registers most strongly, though, is the sense of loneliness and professional drudgery.__Mostly what you get is a chronicle of tedious routine carried out in a killing climate. That gives this documentary a flavor that is strong and genuine. Just not very appealing.__A documentary that's essentially a tribute to a hardy group of people who've made a life on the ice.__The extremes of "Antarctica: A Year on Ice" might seem routine to fans of nature documentaries, but the photographer and director Anthony Powell produces some dazzling imagery in his droll study of isolation way, way down under.__Far less austere than the landscape it shows, Antarctica: A Year On Ice sometimes verges on the corny. But it reveals two polar worlds - the natural and the human - that are fascinating and unfamiliar.__"Antarctica" is successful because it operates on two complementary levels, the epic visuals whose grandeur can stagger you and the small-scale personal stories of the people who live and work down there.__Powell filmed Antarctica over a decade. Some of his footage has turned up elsewhere, in nature docs, but it's never been better presented than here.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
[It] looks lowly and limp, and we seldom feel just how much is at stake.__The film becomes a showcase for Kline and Sarandon - and a reminder of how great actors can light up the screen, staying with you even as the rest of the film slips away.__A character study of an ultimately pathetic man.__Terrific performances help mine the poignancy in a legendary tabloid story.__Since it's impossible to see what the attraction would be, the film's emotional logic fizzles.__The Last of Robin Hood feels stilted, a chamber piece for the stage rather than a dynamic piece of cinema.__This story about a real-life scandal from the 1950s - one that would light up the Internet if it happened today - comes off as a tepid, polite exercise, a movie afraid of its own shadow.__"The Last of Robin Hood" plays like a laboratory control experiment gone wrong: What would happen if you made a movie with a great cast and terrible everything else?__Ultimately the movie feels like an empty exercise. Sure, it's a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of fame. But when the one figure most worthy of our sympathy is nothing more than a beautiful blonde robot, what's the point?__This final-days biopic ... hasn't much to raise it above straight-to-DVD caliber save the performance of Kevin Kline in a role he was born to play.__Kevin Kline makes a terrific Errol Flynn. He just picked the wrong movie to prove it.__[Kline] sails through his performance as the aging lothario Flynn; ably supporting Kline are Dakota Fanning as Flynn's underage paramour and Susan Sarandon as her one-legged mother.__The latest of Kline's period pictures that wastes no time in dashing your expectations.__The film is too wan and distanced to sweep you up, but it holds you, and it doesn't - unlike most Hollywood biopics - leave you feeling as if you need a shower.__Dashing, handsome and self-deprecating, Kevin Kline was born to play Errol Flynn.__The movie's a bit like the ones Flynn had to settle for at the tail end of his career, slightly out-of-control narratives in which poor, dissipated Errol was brought in to add some shaky pathos.__You can't help wondering where "The Last of Robin Hood" left its moral compass.__The story comes to feel mild (and incomplete) in its tempered nostalgia.__The Last of Robin Hood treads delicately on dangerous ground. Without being prurient or titillating, it could have dared to tell us more.__In the end it's a fond, fairly toothless B-movie take on a romance that wasn't so much May-December as straight-up statutory.
Unlike so many American remakes of foreign films, this reboot improves on the original, mostly because it takes full advantage of the star power of its English-speaking cast.__A not-terrific, not-terrible romantic comedy that owes most of its charm to its two stars.__A bland and formulaic tale of two senior citizens who discover that it's never too late to fall in love - which may well be true, but doesn't keep this rickety recycling of a 2005 Spanish-Argentinean comedy from feeling long past its sell-by date.__The movie's too-cute concept yields more rewards than you might reasonably expect.__Though the issues are heavy, the execution is light, enjoyable, but it keeps "Elsa & Fred" closer to "Sleepless in Seattle" than Fellini's deliciously deep Roman affair.__Why must so many movies featuring retirees in romantic relationships make audiences cringe?__Forced, contrived and slow as Christmas, it's a pleasant enough time-waster, but what a treat to spend just under two hours in the hands of pros.__Why do so many filmmakers think "Old People Fall in Love" is the only concept they need?__This misfire of a cornball romance is so tone-deaf, so utterly lacking in screwball snap and visual punch, that viewers will find it hard to care whether or not the aging lovebirds end up in each other's arms.__The movie eventually goes into Woody Allen territory in the best way possible.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Though it bogs down at times, Yoon Jong-bin's kimchi Western is a rousing, lavishly produced delight.__For all its gloss, "Kundo" fails to resonate. You appreciate the execution, but the film is hindered by its lack of novelty and metaphorical weight.__[A] sweeping, visually elegant picture ...__An often entertaining if overlong look at the last days of Korea's Joseon Dynasty.__Kundo is not the best film of its type, but it's an entertaining amalgam.__The filmmakers stage cast-of-dozens battle scenes and one-on-one showdowns with equal brio.__An interesting case of genre tropes shipping back and forth across the Pacific.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"Something happens onstage," Cave says, "where you forget who you are and become someone else." As much as any documentary can, 20,000 Days on Earth allows us to bear witness to what goes on in that process.__The title refers to the fact that the day chronicled is ostensibly Cave's 20,000th alive, though the movie is so slowly paced that 20,000 days seems more like the running time.__Near the end of the movie, Cave talks about living in the 'shimmering space' where imagination and reality intersect. He's talking about words and music, but he could be talking about 20,000 Days on Earth.__An intelligent and revealing look at one of rock's last true iconoclasts.__You don't just meet and learn about Nick Cave in "20,000 Days," you feel him.__Singular exercise in self-indulgence, introspection and tongue-in-cheekiness by the solemn and magnetic Cave.__You might come away wishing he'd remained a bit more enigmatic. Then again, that morose rascal is probably just having us on.__For the uninitiated, it offers a demonstration of what is so mesmerizing about this performer, who is by, his own description, "a kind of ostentatious bastard."__The film is so incessant on bolstering Cave's repute and noble struggle with the art of songwriting that it can't help but seem bloated and self-important.__It's a wondrous mix of the momentous and mundane, the profound and the perverse, with Cave blues-talking his way through the goofy juxtapositions, the darkness, and the light.__It's right up there with the best rock documentaries. That is, if you can call it a documentary.__Maybe "20,000 Days on Earth" is a vanity film. But maybe Cave has earned the right to be vain.__[Nina Simone] put a spell on him, and now Nick Cave, with his lugubrious sleights of hand, does much the same to us.__I'm not sure it can be considered a documentary at all, at least not all the way through. But "20,000 Days" offers an exceptionally intimate portrait of an artist who has sometimes sought to resist explication.__Certainly for any fan of Cave's, 20,000 Days on Earth makes for a creative, enthralling journey through the man's world.__20,000 Days On Earth doesn't try to be a journalistic, comprehensive study of its subject -- but with so much texture and atmosphere on tap, it doesn't need to.__The results are remarkably intelligent and entertaining, even for someone who (like this writer) finds Cave's music rather dirge-like.__The pervasive mood is a brooding hyperawareness of time and the brevity of existence. Sensationalism and salaciousness are minimal.__This is a doc with, among other things, a firm sense of place, and not just your random filmed Q&A with an interesting guy.__We spend one day on Earth with Nick Cave, from dawn til dusk, via family, friends, a recording session and a gig, but it's just a neat device, and much of the film plays out like drama.
Morris is admirably evenhanded, never demonizing his subject, but giving him enough rope to hang himself. Rumsfeld, cool and bemused, refuses to knot the noose.__[A] scary inquiry.__By now the director's technique is so savvy, so confident in its visual layering and atmospheric assurance, even a dodgy, cagey camera subject such as Rumsfeld becomes movieworthy.__Morris doesn't "break" Rumsfeld, as some think he did McNamara. He has held a mirror up to the man, and found no reflection. The viewer simply has to realize that what's important is what's not there.__What emerges is a fascinating portrait of a bygone approach to power, marked by a seemingly contradictory mix of transparency and obfuscation. Rumsfeld embodies that discrepancy.__A portrait of a wartime leader determined to avoid, at any cost, an honest perspective.__The Unknown Known is a worthy addition to Morris's body of work, an epic search that demonstrates the limits of language, the ease of sidestepping truth.__Rumsfeld is eerily unflappable. Morris is too polite, or too something, to push back on Rumsfeld.__In the end, The Unknown Known is inconclusive - albeit provocatively so.__We get little in response from Rumsfeld but a demonstration of his cunning at parrying, dodging, and twisting queries.__Despite the best efforts of Morris, the man comes across as not only shallow, but as a completely empty vessel. It makes for repetitive and depressing viewing.__The only self-examination he ever subjects himself to would appear to involve a shaving mirror and lather.__Fascinating and horrifying.__What's so striking is the abstract nature of his discourse; what's so chilling is his dispassion.__The matchup, culled from 30 hours of interviews, is intoxicating, and at times maddening, to watch.__In short bursts, Rumsfeld is an engaging, witty personality. For the first half hour, no matter what your politics are, you will find yourself liking him. He's good company ... until he's not.__We might have journeyed inside Rumsfeld's mindset for a while, but are we richer for the excursion?__Much against Rumsfeld's will, what the film inevitably reveals, in Morris' words, is "a man using language to obscure the world from himself as well as from others."__The film's message seems to be that in corrupt governments, words are used not to communicate but as a kind of fascist confetti.__Morris is heard badgering Rumsfeld on camera about torture, WMD intelligence and the handling of the war. His subject, though, earns at least a draw.
I'd say this is a movie about alienation that, in the spirit of the boldest activism, isn't afraid to be ostracized itself. You may beg to differ, and I'd say that's the point.__Night Moves, including its title, borders on generic.__Reichardt wisely leaves it for her audience to decide.__"Night Moves" is an unexpected pleasure, offering more than what we expect and taking its time to deliver.__You may not buy the third-act developments, but Reichardt and her actors see to it that you believe in how these people got to that third act in the first place.__"Night Moves" is a study of murky actions, fuzzy ideals and wrong moves for righteous reasons.__As in Wendy and Lucy, the natural and social environs are impeccably authentic, in this case conveying the bohemian radicalism of the Portland area that nurtures the trio's dangerous scheme.__The movie is willing to see its ideas all the way through, while not entirely giving up on plot, and Eisenberg is unafraid to take himself where Reichardt needs him to go, which is right under our skin.__In Night Moves, Reichardt keeps her characters close and up front, so when differences arise in their ranks and signs of vague trouble arise, the suspense starts to mount.__It's a richly engrossing drama, so long as you understand that it's aiming for the head, not the gut.__"Night Moves" is like a slow, meticulous heist movie, almost hypnotic in its precision.__Though at times it threatens to become too generic to be original, or too original to be generic, it retains enough indirection to frustrate those looking for thrills and to engage those willing to be challenged.__The anxious eco-thriller "Night Moves" plays like a saboteur's procedural.__Reichardt gives us scenes of people engaged in mundane labor and aimless conversation, but she doesn't make a case for such scenes as fascinating in themselves.__The film builds its stakes with a methodical reverence for the natural world that the trio seeks to protect.__What interests Reichardt is the physical realization of how the act is done; her feeling for the weight and the palpability of the world, and for continuity within sequences, has become masterly.__A slow-burning suspense thriller about a trio of eco-terrorists conspiring to blow up a dam, it's directed by Reichardt with the concision and elegance of a chess master.__Fanning is marvelous as a woman who's so bright and charming on the surface you can't tell whether she's floundering underneath.__Night Moves may have a soft, almost dreamy feel, but at the core it's crucially hard-headed. In its own quiet way, in how it pulls together our utopian ideals and home-grown fears, it's the zeitgeist movie of the moment.__When I left the theater I still felt complicit - I had to remind myself that I wasn't on the run from the cops. Whether the film is much more than an exercise, though, is open to debate.
This "Punch" never truly connects.__Thompson is one of those rarities who shines in just about anything. Her crack timing enlivens even her worst lines.__Alas, there are no sparks. There is no excitement. Hopkins' clumsy script simply bumbles its way past plot holes into predictabilities.__Most everything about this movie is predictable within the first few minutes ...__Hopkins managed a genuine delight a few years ago with "Last Chance Harvey," starring Thompson and Dustin Hoffman as two late-in-life lovers in London. But his new script has none of that wit.__A good-natured if strenuously wacky caper comedy about a divorced British couple who plot a diamond heist to save their pensions.__Decent. Pleasant. Serviceable. Agreeable.__Seeing The Love Punch is a lot like going on a rather pedestrian cruise but having a smashing couple that you look forward to seeing at dinner every night.__A romantic comedy as painfully unfunny as a sock in the jaw.__The revenge-of-the-ripped-off plot here is nothing new; rarely, though, have we had such charming companions on the voyage over that well-trod ground.__The movie, which feels like something made back in the late 1960s or early '70s, is so relentlessly silly it's hard to watch without a lot of eye-rolling.__Manages to be excruciatingly unfunny despite the presence of Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson in the lead roles.__How to Steal a Million it's not - Brosnan sleepwalks through his dialogue, and there's at least one unforgivable James Bond reference - but The Love Punch is too sunny and self-effacing to be truly toxic.__The comedy is very hit-and-miss and the action elements are also a mixed bag.__Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan deserve better than this creaky heist-caper comedy from 'Last Chance Harvey' director Joel Hopkins.__You haven't seen cringeworthy till you've seen a group of mature British actors in granny-beige M&S slacks doing the Reservoir Dogs walk__None__None__None__None
An amiable diversion, though not a terribly memorable one. Elmore Leonard aficionados longing for a truly worthy sendoff of the master crime writer will have to look ahead toward the upcoming final season of Justified, and cross their fingers.__It doesn't quite transcend its own haphazard, impoverished story.__Thanks to Leonard's source material and the outstanding cast, it works.__All this is more amusing in theory than practice, partly because Leonard's world of wiseguys and slapstick violence has become so familiar - the caper-movie default mode.__There's a lot of talent up on screen put to no grand use.__Life of Crime is like an errant golf putt that appears headed for the hole, but just keeps rolling and rolling, all the way off the green. In other words, just missed . . . by a mile.__A loose, cynical kidnapping caper set, literally and emotionally, in the `70s - right down to its main-title typography - it's a small treat.__There's a pronounced lack of tension in this feature by director Daniel Schechter, who has to deal with a storyline that is, unfortunately, not Mr. Leonard's strongest.__As a late-summer caper movie, it hits the spot.__"Life of Crime" has the authentic Leonard snap, crackle and pop.__The cast does capable work, but you'll wish the movie concentrated more on the comedy, which has some zing, rather than the straighter elements, which quickly start to drag.__[Bey] steals every scene he's in. Unfortunately, in a film this pallid, that amounts to petty theft.__"Life of Crime" feels like a rambling car ride through the countryside with friends. The scenery is great, and the passengers are diverting, but you keep wondering where the driver is headed.__Despite its sluggish intervals, "Life of Crime" satisfies in the end, just when you fear it'll peter out.__There have been good Elmore Leonard adaptations and bad ones. But this interpretation of his 1978 novel The Switch may be the worst of the bunch.__Mostly, it's fine. The acting is fine. The writing is fine. The story is fine. There are a few laughs.__"Life of Crime" is well-made and -acted, especially by Hawkes and Fisher, if it's not exactly gripping or noir-ish.__This Elmore Leonard adaptation doesn't inspire ardor, but it certainly boasts above-average intelligence and a streak of knowing unpredictability that make the dark comedy a pleasurable morsel of escapism.__I found "Life of Crime" pretty doggone funny, but the humor is understated and undercut with notes of brutality and nihilism.__Director Daniel Schechter ("Supporting Characters") moves the plot along in a loose, unhurried manner, letting the cast enjoy Leonard's delicious dialogue.
Ernest learns to share, Celestine learns to a paint - and the audience learns that in a Disney-dominated marketplace, kids are still free to choose their own mini mouse.__The unlikely cross-species friendship of Celestine the mouse and Ernest the bear teaches a gentle lesson about irrational intolerance in this French animated charmer.__"Ernest & Celestine" draws on plenty of classics, animated and otherwise, for inspiration, but the film manages to be delightful on its own offbeat terms.__Ernest & Celestine is a genuine charmer for kids, and for the parental units tagging alongside.__A sweet-natured tale of an unlikely friendship between a burly bear and a plucky mouse. It's also decidedly offbeat with an emphasis on animal dentistry.__A joyous rediscovery of hand-drawn animation, all witty and expressive lines, spare backgrounds and gorgeous, watery hues.__It moves with the rhythms and emotions of classic kids' literature, possesses elegance and belly laughs in equal measure, and is almost magically beautiful to look at. And, like bears, it has bite.__The message is simple, the ending earthshaking and a few scenes border on overly precious. But as the stakes are raised for the pair, a surprising depth of character emerges.__Delicate animation and a charming score may be why this Belgian film earned an Oscar nomination. Its story, however, makes no sense whatsoever.__It has things to say about the world, but it does so gracefully, without hitting you over the head with them.__The enchanting French-Belgian animated feature Ernest & Celestine is so liltingly sweet and graceful that, a day or two after I saw it, it seemed almost as if I had dreamed it.__The movie advances the art of animation without seeming to try.__There isn't much of a moral to this story, but it does put a premium on individuality and pluck. Mostly, "Ernest & Celestine" is an ode to the happiness that comes from being with those different from us.__There's a truly original beauty in "Ernest & Celestine," from its delicate, pastel-hued animation to the look and sound of its inhabitants ...__Not just a positively charming movie, but an ode to the tactile pleasures of handcrafted artistry.__The images have a soft, inviting quality that befits the storybook narrative.__A delicate portrait of a mouse as an artist meets a scruffy portrait of a bear as an all-out entertainer in this witty and imaginative cartoon feature.__Plays out like the kind of picture book that you love as a child and still treasure as an adult. It's a subtle creation, offering the perfect mix of whimsy for kids and wit for grown-ups.__Marked as outsiders by their respective societies, an unlikely friendship is forged, an ill-tempered uproar unleashed, and a delightful movie is the result.__The characters are computer-rendered, but the watercolor environments they move in are expressive and detail-rich.
The world doesn't need another empty genre exercise. But as Blue Ruin reminds us, it can always use more filmmakers of Saulnier's resourcefulness, sensitivity and quiet assurance.__With the same brand of realist irony the Coens used to cool down Blood Simple, writer-director Jeremy Saulnier slows the genre's heartbeat to gripping effect.__Saulnier is also a cinematographer, and he's in complete control of the film's conflation of human-scale horror and tragicomedy.__Blair, an unheralded actor, carries the whole picture. He's in practically every scene, and his performance is fascinating because in his eyes you can see the character struggling desperately with himself.__Saulnier makes impressive use of silence and slow camera movements, allowing the suspense to simmer until violence seems practically inevitable.__Saulnier spills a lot of blood, but he's an extraordinarily responsible and appealing craftsman.__You couldn't ask for a more unlikely avenger than the ill-equipped sort-of hero of Blue Ruin, and that's precisely why it's far, far more suspenseful than the typical violent revenge thriller.__A riveting revenge thriller written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier and built around a singular performance by Macon Blair.__To call Blue Ruin a revenge thriller is to sell this barbed-wire-sharp and altogether surprising American indie short.__As an exercise in cinematic style, "Blue Ruin" is well worth seeing.__"Blue Ruin" is a movie about revenge, but it reaches far past the bottom-shelf titillations of fantasy to tell a richer, character-driven story with a protagonist who's less avenging angel than ghost.__The filmmaker works with economy and has a knack for creating a sense of foreboding, which is good because the plot is simply a working out of the old saw that violence begets violence.__It's a taut, unflinching first act ... But as the bodies pile up and the plot circles in on itself, that beautifully constructed web of suspense begins to unravel.__It's a brilliant, slow-burning American revenge thriller that hardly puts a foot wrong, a work of startling violence and profound conscience that announces the arrival of an exciting young director.__Blair is excellent in the lead, but the filmmaking is the true star here.__Director Jeremy Saulnier has worked largely as a cinematographer, and "Blue Ruin" is marked by careful compositions and lighting.__Blue Ruin's fierce narrative momentum derives from the inexorable logic of eye-for-an-eye reciprocity.__"Blue Ruin" is an uneven film, and there are slip-ups along the way, but the tension that settles in slowly like a low-grade fever keeps you with it.__Mocking vigilante violence while slapping it on in gorgeous splatters, "Blue Ruin" is little more than an archipelago of attacks and retaliations that pay off only in blood spilled and vendetta advanced.__A gory instant-classic cult film about a maladroit revenge killer.
It's a movie that raises as many questions as it addresses, and which never quite convincingly answers even the most pressing one: Just what made the son of a radical Palestinian-liberation leader go to work as an Israeli spy?__The movie's empty pizzazz is especially irritating because the story would have been compelling without any embellishment.__It's a harrowing tale of intrigue and betrayal, but also one of a friendship that survives despite extraordinary circumstances.__[A] gripping documentary set against the internecine battle between Israel and Palestine.__This a film that leaves many unanswered questions, but it's nonetheless satisfying, because it resonates emotionally and offers a ray of hope that the human spirit has the ability to trump entrenched political perspectives.__These interviews complement rather than contradict each other.__The Green Prince is an extraordinary achievement. It has all the suspense of a great espionage yarn, but it's also a powerful moral document that calls into question the tactics of terrorism.__It takes a personal rather than a political perspective, exploring the ambiguities of truth and individual identity rather than the complexities of an ongoing historical calamity.__Though it's set in the context of a highly combustible international situation, its emphasis is always on the personal, on these two men and what they came to mean to each other.__If "The Green Prince" sustains the tension of a well-executed thriller, it is achieved at the cost of a dispassionate objectivity.__More than just a morality tale, "The Green Prince" is a thrill-a-minute spy caper too strange to be real, though it is.__"The Green Prince" is a timely look at how one man broke the cycle of violence born of blind allegiance by seeking out the facts and coming up with his own solutions.__A taut piece of work that features just two talking heads: a prized Palestinian informant and his ever-cautious Israeli handler.__Its ironies are redolent of John le Carre - Yousef had to be imprisoned so he wouldn't appear to be an informant - and the stakes of his deception are such that the film deserves to be remade with actors, Hollywood style.__Mostly it's the two men speaking at us, and our interest ebbs and flows depending on which parts of the tale they're telling.__The human journey behind a most unusual collaboration in the Middle East slowly comes into focus in this documentary.__With "The Green Prince," an extraordinarily engrossing tale becomes an extremely uncinematic experience in the hands of Israeli documentarian Nadav Schirman.__None__None__None
Say this for Terry Gilliam: Even when he repeats himself, he's unique.__Gives one the sense that the ex-Monty Python-ite thinks he's at a filmmaker version of the Last Chance Saloon, manufacturing and recycling as fast as he can.__It's bursting with Gilliam's trademark manic energy, but the focus and execution are so soft that that energy ends up derailing the film instead of invigorating it.__The culture's caught up to Gilliam. Everybody's doing Orwell now. But Gilliam's appropriation feels both aptly skeptical and unfashionably utopian.__There is something so generous and so full-hearted in this profusion that to complain seems churlish, but "The Zero Theorem" has a bothersome ratio of misses to hits.__This "Theorem" is all sizzle, zero steak.__For the most part, Gilliam's visual eye drowns out his actor's performances, and in this case the effect is marred by a distinct familiarity to his imagined world.__I'm not quite sure I have a handle on what Terry Gilliam is trying to say in "The Zero Theorem." I'm not sure he does, either.__"The Zero Theorem" doesn't fully earn the elaborately conceived scaffolding on which its relatively tame ideas are hoisted. Cosmic existential despair feels too well-plumbed a cinematic subject to seem new or genuinely daring.__Maybe "The Zero Theorem" doesn't add up to much on paper, but, particularly for Gilliam fans, it's infinitely watchable.__An intellectual exercise in which you're never given all the variables to solve the problem - and then you find your calculator was on acid the whole time anyway.__If you're inclined to fall into Terry Gilliam's heady fantasias, this eye-catching entry won't disappoint. But the movie may leave a feeling of vague dissatisfaction.__This cartoonish sci-fi satire might be described as Terry Gilliam's Mr. Arkadin-a visually inspired but frequently confounding (and clearly underfinanced) reworking of longtime personal themes.__Director Terry Gilliam's nearly 20-year streak of bad movies remains unbroken with "The Zero Theorem," yet another project whose narrative gets swallowed by its design.__If only this imaginative environment were populated with a single compelling character or stimulating idea, rather than serving as busy distraction from the narrative tedium.__Too bad the story tucked around all that production design is such a futuristic drag.__Gilliam's penchant for overstimulation can numb your visual cortex, but Theorem is still the best thing he's pulled out of that bag in a while.__At once cluttered and cavernous, hysterical and static, romantic and cynical, The Zero Theorem works most effectively moment by moment and in the details.__As usual with Gilliam's films, the production is more delightful to behold than to parse.__full of Gilliam's stylistic hallmarks - layered realities, overbearing technology, institutional paranoia and of course, quirky romance - it feels like a personal journey into his beliefs, as it stares into the divide between reason and faith.
Music here seems to have a miraculous power to lift up, to awaken, to reinvigorate.__Equal parts heart-wrenching and heart-lifting ...__The movie effectively bullies you into feeling good; with its hard sell and superfluous CG imagery, it might as well be a superhero movie.__The movie is at its best when documenting the reactions of various patients, which in some cases is nearly miraculous.__Alive Inside is a small but vibrant miracle. The documentary finds hope and joy in one of our nation's bleakest settings, nursing homes.__In a world drowning in bad news about dementia - an estimated 5 million Americans currently suffer, 10 million serve as their caregivers, with both numbers inevitably going up - "Alive Inside" is positively tonic.__The voice-over narration grows increasingly hucksterish and bathetic, dementia sufferers are reduced to generic images in uplifting montages, and the film begins to resemble an ad pitching some dubious charity or a retirement community.__Alive Inside packs as potent a simple emotional wallop as anything you'll see - or hear - anywhere this year.__The movie, directed by Michael Rossato-Bennett, makes a powerful argument for the program.__The movie hovers between diatribe and misplaced diplomacy. At certain times, you want to ask Rossato-Bennett "What's the problem?"__A documentary that never leaves any doubt about what comes next, while single-mindedly stumping for a cause presented as unique, is also not terribly interesting as a film.__Alive Inside's repetitive nature and lack of depth make it come across more like a fundraising effort than a movie ...__Dan Cohen's crusade to bring music into nursing homes could be the leading edge of a monumental change in the way we approach the care and treatment of older people, especially the 5 million or so Americans living with dementia disorders.__Compellingly conveys how music - so intimately wedded to our emotions, and experiences - can help the severely ill elderly reconnect with themselves.__Michael Rossato-Bennett captures some amazingly transformative results in the treatment of dementia through music.__None__None__None__None__None
The ultimate triumph in what Amalric has done is to show us all the different forces that can be at work in an affair.__A dazzling deconstruction of the mystery genre that turns its conventions on their heads.__'The Blue Room" is a tight little look at love gone wrong, something of a stripped-down French "Gone Girl" without the surprises.__It's an accomplished film, if a bit cool and tidy; you wish there were a little more to it.__The pleasure of a whodunit generally derives from trying to figure out who done it, but in the case of this arty, terminally obscure French mystery, most of the story has already transpired before one can even piece together what was done.__The film is so bloodless that you don't care which legal side wins. Even the boudoir scenes are drab.__"The Blue Room" is the kind of film that demands to be seen more than once.__"Blue Room" demonstrates that, as a director, Amalric has begun to master the medium. Now he needs to work on expanding his palette.__As a storyteller, Amalric is a master of manipulation, first leading the audience in one direction and then another.__"The Blue Room" feels like only two acts of a three-act story. With a whole other movement and 25 more minutes, this could have been an entirely satisfying picture.__Tense, intriguing and will keep the viewer off-balance.__It is a quiet but intense and closely observed piece of work.__Amalric throws in flashbacks and flash-forwards between bedroom and courthouse, and I was reminded again why I prefer my noirs in the hardboiled American style rather than tricked up with all this faux Alain Resnais-style filigree.__Mr. Amalric's direction remains graceful through the story's violent turns, its mood changes and tone shifts.__Every revelation registers in the gifted Amalric's gaze: infinitesimal physical mutations, emotional detonations.__The teasing pace creates a noirish tension that, alas, peters out by the time the justice system decides Julien's fate.__The Blue Room pieces together the details of its plot like a jigsaw puzzle, but seeing the final picture is not its principal pleasure.__The real mystery is not a whodunit but the unplumbed narcissistic and masochistic depths of the male ego.__The mystery is pretty low-key and the resolution somewhat disappointing. But Amalric is mesmerizing and the film's taut, chilly tone leaves us unnerved.__[Amalric's] leanest, most morose, and most handsomely accomplished work, distinguished by enigmatic close-ups, lush orchestrations, and delicate lighting.
Sitting there with something like National Gallery, it's not the rush of time you feel. It's the rush of applied skill.__If a picture is worth a thousand words, then there are at least a million things worth talking about in National Gallery.__National Gallery presents the famous art space as almost a living and breathing thing, with all the complications and rough glory that implies.__"National Gallery," a meandering trip through the famed London art institution, has many sublime scenes - and some tedious ones, too.__Though Wiseman's now well into his 80s, his eye's as sharp as ever.__Frederick Wiseman's documentary National Gallery is for art lovers, movie lovers -- basically for anybody.__[An] iridescent look at London's premier art institution.__It is such a gift that Frederick Wiseman, who is edging toward 85, continues to let his curiosity and his craft fill his days and our theaters.__An immersion in art and humanity.__Mr. Wiseman's film, like the institution it examines, enhances the art of seeing, the pleasure of understanding.__"It's this wonderful mixture of observation and imagination," a lecturer says of Leonardo's "Madonna of the Rocks," one of the museum's prize possessions. Something similar can be said of Wiseman and his film.__"National Gallery" could have used a few more edits; its long run time may limit its appeal. But the film is remarkably engaging and, with close looks at so many important pieces of art, bursting with beauty.__The museum's interior is neoclassical, and Wiseman's severely restrained style of filmmaking matches it perfectly.__Like many of the 39 documentaries Frederick Wiseman has made since his controversial debut with Titicut Follies in 1967, this film is a leisurely if disciplined exploration of an institution, patient in its observances and curious about every detail.__The elder statesman of American documentary, Frederick Wiseman, returns with an in-depth look at London's great museum, home to a spectacular array of masterpieces.__After 47 years of making documentaries, Frederick Wiseman has his methodology down pretty darn pat, for better or worse (usually better).__Like most of Mr. Wiseman's work, the movie is at once specific and general, fascinating in its pinpoint detail and transporting in its cosmic reach.__Long, leisurely paced, wide-ranging, meticulously crafted, intellectually intricate, and touched with profundity.__You may initially find yourself missing the emotional pull of the film's first sections, but it's all to an increasingly intriguing point.__Turning his camera on works of art and the people who steer the distinguished London complex, the grand old man of hands-off documentaries studies paintings and bears witness to staff meetings, curatorial discussions and gallery talks.
The mysteries are fascinating, all the more so because they are still unsolved.__A dazzling documentary about an unsolved murder in an ad hoc community in the Galapagos islands in 1934.__"The Galapagos Affair" spins a strange and compelling tale, with perfectly sinister music by Laura Karpman setting the mood. But the movie is better at building suspense than following through.__The film feels less like a whodunit than a "why didn't they do it sooner?"__Though the pace occasionally flags during its two-hour running time, "The Galapagos Affair" is a fascinating look at a place of great beauty and remoteness, and at the kind of people drawn to live there.__Move over, Charles Darwin, when it comes to great tales about the Galapagos, you've got company.__How could this not be a great documentary? By putting it in the hands of Dayna Goldfine and Dan Geller, who have squandered their sensational subject into a two-hour slog.__The denouement plays like a remix of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness with a chorus of unreliable narrators.__Easily, this is the most irresistible movie of 2014, so far.__A stranger-than-fiction gem.__I wonder what Charles Darwin would have made of this movie. Survival of the fittest doesn't begin to explain what happened on Floreana.__The lessons, although obvious, bear repeating.__Somehow, there's a great deal of silent-film footage of these folks, taken at the time of the events described, as well as a treasure trove of still photos, allowing directors Daniel Geller and Dayna Goldfine to keep things visually compelling.__How anyone could make such an uninvolving movie out of such a fascinating subject remains its own inexplicable mystery.__At the birthplace of Darwinism, we witness human potential give way to animalism.__The doc never yokes all these threads into anything particularly deep or illuminating. The Galapagos Affair is less social commentary, more gossip.__A bizarre real-life drama of the 1930s is well told in this resourceful documentary.__[A] disorganized docu.__None__None
A thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating documentary about Landis' amazing feats as a forger and con man.__It's the kind of story a filmmaker dreams of - and yet, "Art and Craft" leaves the viewer uneasy.__Perhaps the year's most delightfully charming documentary.__Sam Cullman, Jennifer Grausman, and Mark Becker, the directors of "Art and Craft," have themselves an enticing subject in Landis's activities. They do not have an enticing subject in Landis himself.__Directors Sam Cullman and Jennifer Grausman maintain a bright tone and a melancholy undercurrent, which combine in an eminently watchable character study.__A fascinating look inside the troubled mind of a master of deception.__Landis has made a lot of people very angry, and the movie deals with a serious issue - namely the way obsessions take control of us.__A droll documentary that may remind you of Errol Morris' work.__The constant scrutiny of a camera seems exploitative and cruel, even if you are at all suspicious when he rationalizes his behavior as childlike mischief.__"Nothing's original under the sun," muses Mark Landis in the consistently compelling documentary "Art and Craft." But he seems to be discounting himself.__Mr. Landis, who lives in Laurel, Miss., and has operated under several pseudonyms, is the enigmatic core of a movie that becomes pedestrian only when the focus switches to a one-man crusade to expose him.__Compelling but dubious ...__Sympathetic yet gently unnerving ...__This crazy-gazing docu never presumes to be much more than an extended version of the kind of story one might expect to see briefly spotlighted on 60 Minutes. Even so, all sorts of interesting questions.swirl beneath the surface.__Deeply eccentric subject makes for an engaging art-doc.__None__None__None__None__None
Arestrup and Dussollier are mesmerizing as they attack and parry, argue and counterargue. They reminisce about their lives before the war and wax poetic about their families - then engage in battle again.__Diplomacy will work for those who appreciate dialogue-based character films in which plot is of secondary importance.__Although we know what happens, Diplomacy keeps up the suspense and pulls off surprises as Choltitz's decision reaches its inevitable ending.__Its minor thrills come not from not knowing what will happen, but from watching the cagey choreography of two acrobatic minds.__If you've had your fill of tony World War II dramas, this probably won't renew your interest in the genre, but the leads are fine as usual and Schlondorff succeeds in making the stagebound material feel reasonably cinematic.__Tere's a fair amount of talking in circles, even with the film's brisk running time. The dialogue also reflects the material's stage origins in ways that don't always translate well.__It's quite a triumph for Diplomacy in general and Schlondorff's pinpoint filmmaking in particular to involve us as thoroughly as it does in the ebb and flow of their compelling conversation.__Adapted from a stage production written by Cyril Gely, it feels more theatrical than cinematic, but its historic importance is adequate to hold viewers' attention.__Well-orchestrated and superbly acted. Though we know the outcome, the fate of Paris seems anything but guaranteed.__The principal suspense in this fascinating movie is generated by the polite, and then not so polite, ferocity of the arguments between the two men.__Based on the French play by Cyril Gely and directed by Volker Schlondorff's Diplomacy is so soundly engineered and acted that it doesn't seem stagey at all.__The film's a little too flashy and theatrical, with too-neat ironies. As a duel between acting talents, though, this is first-rate.__Has enough visual panache to compensate for the static, conversational nature of the work.__What Gely lacks in historical fidelity he gains in dramatic interplay between men who held power very differently.__The value of "Diplomacy" is that it produces at least as much unsettlement as relief, compelling the viewer to remain haunted by nightmarish thoughts of what might have happened.__Diplomacy's origins as a play (written by Cyril Gely and starring the same actors) are always evident.__To be sure, we are in that authorial fantasy by which historical figures become shrewder, sharper and wittier than they surely were in life... But when the actors and the dialogue are this good, one scarcely objects.__It's Arestrup who really steals the show, turning von Cholitz into a man who bears the weight of several thousand soldiers, not to mention an entire civilian population, and who suffers under that burden until making a final, eleventh hour decision.__None__None
Slickly directed by actor Mike Myers, it intersperses Gordon's sunny reminiscences with testimony from an army of A-list clients and celebrity pals. Admittedly, there are great stories here.__It may leave you asking: Why did I just watch that old guy's birthday tape?__Yes, there is some gravity in the film, but mostly it's the rock-and-roll story of a rock-and-roll life (even though one of his favorite clients was Canadian folk singer Anne Murray).__How can you not love this guy, this story?__For all the love emanating from client-pals Michael Douglas, Sylvester Stallone, Emeril Lagasse, and Steven Tyler, there's a sadness to this movie that remains just off camera.__Mike Myers makes his directorial debut by chronicling the fascinating life of one of Hollywood's most fabled raconteurs and charismatic talent managers.__Good-natured and an enjoyable watch. If Myers really just wanted to show his appreciation, he went above and beyond.__Many "who knew?" moments to keep pop-culture fans fascinated.__You may relish the gossipy, dishy stuff Myers serves up. For a while, you can feel like a part of the golden circle.__It's an affectionate, sometimes downright slobbery career salute with a soft, unexamined center - a moving experience for all involved, no doubt, but one of limited interest outside the celebrity bubble it depicts.__Not that 'Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon' is likely to do the kind of business most Myers movies do ... but it's competent enough to suggest the filmmaker has more arrows in his quiver than 'yeah, baby.'__While Gordon may be a minor figure at best, he is, as this film shows, exactly what a mensch should be.__A man is more than just the sum of his dropped names and star-dusted anecdotes. And a movie needs to be more than this.__Light, frenetic and anecdote-rich, it's the kind of back-patting Hollywood toast to the guy behind the guy that's breezy good fun if you don't examine it too hard.__Myers makes a pretty good case for the "supermensch" benediction for Gordon.__While it's an entertaining documentary, audiences may not find the 68-year-old Gordon's trajectory quite as fascinating as Myers appears to.__This clubby documentary lauds the swellness and shrewdness of the talent manager Shep Gordon with the help of celebrities and the sunnily mellifluent subject himself.__[A] fast-moving, entertaining documentary directed with penache by Mike Myers ...__The movie is most interesting as a collection of trivia-and trivial if amusing testimonials.__As much fun as it is, this all-star tribute is awfully one-note, never questioning Gordon's seemingly casual habit of befriending only the ultra-famous.
It's a story so outlandish that it needs to be served by a combination of drama and comedy, and "Rob the Mob" finds that balance quite well.__As Tommy and Rosie, Pitt and Arianda are just the right kind of nuts, the right kind of dumb, the right kind of desperate and the right kind of in love to make it all go down like pie.__De Felitta has a feel for this world and its atmosphere, from the clutter and casual ugliness of the streets, to the insularity of the mentality, to the unexpected sweetness and vulnerability of the people.__One of the pleasures of Rob the Mob, director Raymond De Felitta's serio-comic crime drama, is watching Pitt and Arianda as the rambunctious, lovestruck pair who can't believe the scam they've stumbled upon.__"Rob the Mob" skims over the lifted-from-the-headlines exploits of an outlaw couple and gleans a humanist drama steeped in sentimentality.__A romance about two down-and-outers that reveals the workings of a whole citywide ecosystem of crime and punishment.__Mr. Pitt is a credible lunkhead, and Ms. Arianda is a delight, dressing Rosie's filthy mouth in the sweetest of smiles. If you were Tommy, you'd want to give her everything, too.__The always distinctive Raymond De Felitta ("City Island'') offers a hilarious mob comedy with virtually no violence, though it's based on a tabloid-ready true story that did not end at all happily.__The movie winds up being a real standup flick, if you know what I mean.__There's an endearing, handmade quality to Rob The Mob, shot in a warm, nostalgic palette that opens a window on a grittier city of graffiti-strewn subways and petty schemers.__Raymond De Felitta's terrifically entertaining film benefits from a smart screenplay and superb performances.__The stickups, while plenty funny - an Uzi firing uncontrollably can still be hilarious - lack any sense of dread or danger.__What starts as a charming two-hander (with more than a little in common with True Romance) gets lost as the supporting cast multiplies.__Raymond De Felitta's second collaboration with producer-star Andy Garcia is a lively true-crime tale with a sensational turn from Nina Arianda.__None__None__None__None__None__None
With its awful acting, terrible dialogue, and laughable special effects, "Jinn" strains for the hapless genius of Ed Wood, but ends up just another bad movie.__Most of the time, this incoherent thriller resembles an overheated trailer for itself: a glaringly rough assembly of ill-staged computer-generated action sequences and portentous moments.__As an attention-grabbing opening installment for what's obviously intended as an ongoing horror franchise, "Jinn" fizzles.__A watchable if rather convoluted effort.__A horror franchise isn't born.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Bethlehem's plot is nothing new; it's the oft-told Cain and Abel story updated for the age of suicide bombers and tactical strikes, as a tautly structured mix of melodrama and ticking-clock thriller.__Cinematographer Yaron Scharf shoots Bethlehem like a modern western, every grimace, twitch and drop of sweat playing in stark relief against an implacable landscape that has seen much spilled blood.__The politics of "Bethlehem" are complex, but the relationship at its heart is simple: a kid who needs some kind of stability in his life, even if it comes from a most unlikely, and dangerous, place.__A rich, multilayered character study cleverly garbed as an action thriller, Bethlehem is a searing critique of the conflict and its toll - not just in human lives, but also in two peoples' gradual, overall loss of humanity.__Bethlehem remains a fairly powerful experience because so much of what we see is inflamed by a violence that seems to have no end.__The story of a young Palestinian, pushed into informing by the Israeli secret police, and forced to navigate conflicting feelings of loyalty, betrayal, self-interest and revenge.__The filmmakers don't settle for palliatives. Each side is wrong, each side is right, and both have their brutalities.__This fleet-footed suspense film breaks new ground as it retells the story of a Palestinian youth who informs for the Israeli secret service.__Debut filmmaker Yuval Adler reportedly was an Israeli spook, which would account for the film's rich and persuasive spy-world detail.__A taut, expertly constructed, and suspenseful police procedural, it also explores the issues of loyalty, trust, betrayal, and revenge that those engaged in such morally ambiguous activities would prefer not to think about.__"Bethlehem" is about the Arab-Israeli struggle, naturally, but finds its real emotional heat in the internecine conflicts that keep an insurgency raging and a people off-balance.__Adler nicely harnesses the mounting volatility of this situation, which builds to an intense if tragic conclusion.__The movie has the taut efficiency of a well-constructed crime thriller, while its real-world underpinnings play out with a less convincing sense of urgency.__By its conclusion, this fascinating film has informed its viewers more than a hundred political essays could.__Director Yuval Adler has a big vision, one capable of looking upon unsympathetic characters with sympathy or at least humane comprehension.__A slickly plotted ticking-time-bomb thriller with a crisp look and one standout debut performance, by Hitham Omari as a ruthless leader of a terrorist cell.__The rare movie that feels too short.__Mar'i and Halevi invest deeply, but the film manipulates them to an abrupt end; viewers will undoubtedly supply their own opinions about the cynical game of covert warfare.__An unstinting look at the impossible choices faced by Israelis and Palestinians caught between worlds, Bethlehem plumbs the destructive aspects of the double-agent mode of statecraft.__The suspense plot is effective yet familiar; the direction is brisk, even hasty, and impersonal.
The film's bleakness is almost satirical. It's Brazil drained of the daydreams.__The Double invites second looks and close examination. As Simon finds when peering into mirrors, what we see is often unexpected.__The Double doesn't get very deep, but it does get interesting.__"The Double" has a theatrical, self-conscious quality to it; the performances feel stagy and its production design looks like a grimly monotone Wes Anderson movie.__"The Double" is a striking piece of work, but it's nostalgic for a kind of paranoia that may no longer exist. There are different things to frighten us now.__Most of the time, "The Double" feels less like watching a book than reading a movie.__[A] pitiless and very funny comedy of misfortune constructed by director Richard Ayoade and his co-writer Avi Korine.__Ayoade creates a uniquely stylized dystopia, lit in dusty tones of olive and ochre and scored, mysteriously but somehow perfectly, to vintage Japanese pop.__Ayoade's breathtakingly realized oddity will appeal to fans of David Lynch and the comic surrealism of Terry Gilliam's "Brazil."__This workplace-as-hellscape is not new territory, exactly - the story's based on Dostoevsky, plays like Kafka, and looks like an Orwellian nightmare. But who'd complain, since it lets Jesse Eisenberg offer what amounts to an acting master-class.__As a pure head-trip visual and auditory experience it feels like one of the biggest discoveries, and biggest surprises, of 2014.__While this film about copies may feel a little familiar, it's also original - in all the best ways.__A darkly ironic and skillfully surreal examination of an unrealized life.__The kind of movie that may have been more satisfying to make than it is to watch.__If The Double never fully succeeds, it's still exactly the sort of challenge and risk one wants out of a filmmaker as promising as Ayoade.__Ayoade's new film makes little attempt to ingratiate. Simon's ordeal is a spectacle, not a tragedy meant to sear the viewer's soul; it's less psychological than satirical.__Director Richard Ayoade gets a huge impact from minimal expressionist sets.__It's lifeless, for the most part, a drama suffocated by its schematic style.__If you're on its wavelength, it's a dive into quirky, murky fun. But even if you are, this oddball offering is vague and slippery, a calmer brother to "Brazil" or Orson Welles' Kafka tale "The Trial."__A dumb show annihilated on the electric wire of pretentiousness, The Double recalls too many similar movies for its own good.
Well-written, strongly acted, and often very funny ...__If Philip showed a bit of personality beyond being a boor and a bore, he might be worth almost two hours of attention.__Perry's acerbic sense of the literary/academic lifestyle - which, oddly enough, involves less actual writing and teaching than drinking and "thinking" - is both exceptionally funny and deeply sad.__Why would anyone want to spend time with these people? Because they're fools with great gifts, and Perry almost lovingly explores the gulf between the beauty with which they create and the smallness with which they live.__Written and directed by Alex Ross Perry, Listen Up Philip looks like the kind of movie film classes would study in the 1970s.__But while you'd think audiences would barely even register a cad any more, two new movies - 'Listen Up Philip' and 'Force Majeure' - resurrect the breed with leading men who are almost impossible to empathize with, but compelling nonetheless__A very entertaining black comedy for very mysterious reasons.__While the intolerance fueling this dark, existential comedy won't be to everyone's liking, the film's cerebral beat-down is a strange and sardonic thing of beauty.__How you respond to "Listen Up Philip" might depend on how you respond to a complex, intelligent but thoroughly annoying person who gets up in your face at a party.__As a rising young novelist in the Philip Roth vein, Schwartzman delivers Perry's dyspeptic, neurotic, supremely arrogant dialogue even better than Perry himself did in the earlier movie.__Writer-director Perry has made a bracing and very Roth-y study of ambition and itchy literary yearning.__"Listen Up Philip" works as satire, but it's also as big and messy as one of its novelists' novels.__"Listen Up Philip" wants to say something meaningful about human relationships. But like a frustrated writer staring at a blank piece of paper, the words just never appear.__Uncomfortable? Sure. But it's also kind of fantastic.__Listen Up Philip, the third feature from writer/director Alex Ross Perry, may be this year's most unpleasant movie I've nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed.__Despite Philip and Ike's deep-set stubbornness, however, the experience of watching Listen Up Philip feels like a revelation.__A central figure who's all bad is even more boring than one who's all good. He has no dramatic stature. He's a case study. The audience should be paid to listen up.__The movie works on a couple of levels at once, being not only a Rothian story, but a kind of story about Roth - or any writer who's sometimes found it easier to focus on pages than people.__The vainglorious pas de deux between Philip and Zimmerman is entertaining for a while, though the novelty gradually wears off.__Jason Schwartzman is deadpan dynamite in Alex Ross Perry's poisonous valentine to the New York literary scene. Some audiences just don't cotton to movies with flawed characters you love to hate. Pussies.
A Summer's Tale is one of those movies where it looks like nothing is happening ...__Few directors could say as much with as little as Eric Rohmer.__There's a purity to the experience of watching a film so naturalistic, like living in someone else's life for two hours.__The best films leave space for viewers to interpret the action. Here Rohmer insists on it.__This is a movie of high innocence, set at a time in life when romantic love is still a frolic and the seaside is a balm that quells all ills.__Astute, unhurried and gently amusing, it will be welcomed by the director's fans while serving as a fine introduction for those who know him not.__The world turns, the sun rises and sets, and the ocean's waves splash on idyllic beaches in Eric Rohmer's "A Summer's Tale."__For all his seeming facility with the opposite sex, Gaspard is really a romantic idiot. And aren't we all, Rohmer suggests.__The fresh-faced actors, realistic dialogue and naturalistic performances suggest a casual approach, but as the story progresses, the filmmaker's control is increasingly evident.__Originally released in 1996 in France (but never before in the U.S.), Eric Rohmer's sun-kissed love quadrangle remains as fresh and romantically profound as it was 18 years ago.__"A Summer's Tale" has room to focus on Rohmer's brilliance at revealing human nature through articulate, multidimensional characters, perfectly cast, who in some ways seem to exist outside of time.__Discovering that there's a 1996 movie by Eric Rohmer that's only now making it into U.S. theaters is like finding a $20 bill in an old pair of pants.__Think of it as a thriller by Hitchcock-a Rohmer favorite-only with words, not knives, that cut straight to the heart.__A Summer's Tale feels like a great beach read of a movie, that deceptively slender paperback you tuck into your luggage because it's substantial without weighing much.__[It's] as if the director had been awaiting for half a century the artistry with which to exorcise his memories of embarrassment, pain, and sexual frustration.__A Summer's Tale is vintage Eric Rohmer, his most richly satisfying film in a number of outings.__Poupaud may come off as callow and timid... but Rohmer seems to suggest that his youthful mistakes will make him a better man, a typically generous, hopeful, and convincing sentiment in a disarmingly winning film.__The third, sunniest and funniest of Rohmer's seasonal tales.__At the age of 76, filmmaker Eric Rohmer probably has a better understanding of young love than most young lovers do.__None
Like most documentary makers addressing the health care crisis, McGarry can't begin to get his arms around the whole problem; this works best as a highly subjective account of a small portion of it.__It sticks halos (probably well-deserved) atop the heads of its doctors, it goes for poignant moments without being all that poignant and ends up bemoaning without seriously suggesting any concrete paths to improvement.__A must-see for anyone concerned about the state of health care in this country. Which should be all of us.__"Code Black" shows the passion, frustration, and skill of those who work to heal despite the system, but it remains in the dark about why that system is broken and how it can be fixed.__"Code Black" presents itself as a demonstration of the current crisis in health care, and it's hard to watch without becoming enraged.__Code Black... succeeds in its most important mission: taking us to ground zero of the health care mess.__"Code Black" is a powerful and quietly damning film.__The precarious state of contemporary health care is shockingly evident. McGarry follows a team of idealistic, committed and unflappable medical residents.__Part of what makes "Code Black" so exciting is that it may be one of the best examples of the new possibilities of the age of digital filmmaking.__Despite occasional platitudes from director and doctor Ryan McGarry, the film makes an angry, urgent plea for reform to a health-care system that's still critically infirm.__A vigorous companion piece to Peter Nicks's revealing 2012 documentary, "The Waiting Room," "Code Black" (the title describes the emergency room's saturation point) is a keening cri de coeur.__The stark disparity between the recent footage and the C-booth material shot back in 2008 tells its own troubling story.__There's too much gloopy piano music underscoring the interviews ...__What will pull viewers in is the empathy of the healthcare workers who battle to retain their idealism in the face of staggering obstacles.__Code Black feels like a brisk, vital report from the frontlines of emergency medicine, forged and rooted in the most intense sort of personal and professional experience.__[Director Ryan McGarry's] extraordinary access to life-and-death moments and his illuminating perspective on the medical system make for a powerful viewing experience.__None__None__None__None
A pallid and terminally cutesy movie that succeeds by stoking blandly happy feelings.__We Are the Best! is the rare film about childhood friendship that seems to take place inside the world of children, not filtered through an adult scrim of nostalgia.__The whole thing is very smart and sweet, as are the performances.__This is a knowing film, and a liberating one.__The young actresses are flawless, and their ear-banging music, which remains awful throughout the film, is nonetheless full of static electricity.__[Moodysson] captures the crushing urgency and emotional craziness of youth. It's not blood that flows through these girls' veins, it's nitroglycerin.__"We Are the Best!" is a messy, congenial empowerment story that knows how aggravating adolescence can be when you refuse to fit in.__It's a title that makes quite a statement. Few viewers will be inclined to argue.__It's impossible not to root for these appealing if flawed youngsters.__There just aren't enough films about teen-age girl punk bands made by left-wing feminist Swedish Christian males.__Sometimes too faithful to teenage aimlessness, We Are the Best! can be shapeless and uneventful. But the movie often jolts to life, whether with outbursts of hostility or moments of gleeful female bonding.__One of the funniest and happiest movies I've ever seen about early adolescent girls and their wayward, fitful joyousness.__The movie is refreshingly sensitive to gender, but also transcends it. What unites the three clashing heroines is their resistance to conventional cliques and schoolhouse conformity. In more ways than one, they're a band of outsiders.__When the girls chant the film's titular mantra, not only do we feel like it's true, we feel we've earned the right to chant along.__Audiences can be pleased to find a story in which its young female characters aren't victims, or even pretty little liars, but just friends. And good ones, at that.__If ever a movie earned the exclamation point in its title, it's Lukas Moodysson's "We Are the Best!"__We are the Best! is smart, funny and real, an honest peek into the secret lives of girls.__What we have here is an exhilarating blast of a movie, full of heart but still punk rock... We Are the Best! is loud, crude, socially irresponsible and totally irresistible.__It's a being-of-age story, in Swedish with English subtitles, the age being early adolescence, when kids with throbbing hearts and incompletely wired brains are full of passion and blithe illogic.__Swedish auteur Lukas Moodysson returns to his roots here with a charming coming-of-age drama.
It seems rather optimistically insistent on making a case that America has come a long way in 20 years, when the truth is 20 years is a mere historical heartbeat.__Hill, now a professor at Brandeis, looks back on the events of 1991 with courage and grace.__As Hill says - and personifies - in the film, "honesty, dignity and courage is what will be remembered."__Frieda Mock's documentary "Anita" is a dutiful history lesson even as it brings us closer to the very private person at the center of that long-ago, still relevant storm.__It's a reminder of what we were and, thanks to Hill, how far we've come.__Focusing on her as a personality at the expense of the incident's greater social, racial, and political context reduces this to a liberal exercise in self-congratulation.__If you can't place the name, or want to know more, "Anita" is a splendid place to start.__It conveys Ms. Hill's journey from an accuser alone to an activist who shares with, and listens to, others.__About the only interesting detail the film adds to a familiar story is that Hill saves all the letters she receives - 25,000 so far - sorted by theme in neat, lawyerly filing cabinets.__One thing is clear: This documentary is more of a coronation than a portrait of a divisive figure. It would have been nice to hear the voices of anti-Hill figures who were involved in the proceedings.__Anita repeatedly succumbs to hero worship, drawing attention away from the social forces working against Hill and ignoring the nitty-gritty detail work of feminism in favor of a sugary empowerment high.__So shapeless in its hagiography, so triumphal in its vagueness, so hapless in arguing its case.__Hill comes across as a figure of tremendous resolve and courage.__Enthralling and revealing portrait of Anita Hill, whose Senate Judiciary testimony led the country to recognize workplace sexual harassment.__Anita may be a tribute doc, but it's one with real heft.__None__None__None__None__None
It seems to have been made by people who couldn't decide if their film was a horror flick, a whodunit, or a Hellboy knockoff.__Radcliffe, through his sheer presence and the piercing honesty of those big, blue eyes, makes this mixed-up material watchable.__Horns juggles a lot of balls, and admirably keeps them in the air for longer than you might expect. But it doesn't know how to bring them down gently.__There are a couple of decent movies somewhere inside "Horns." But here's the real sin - Aja has no idea in hell of what they are.__Campy-fun but pointless ...__"Horns" is a good-ideas-gone-wild movie that leaves the best of itself behind.__The result is that a story with a couple of good ideas founders for lack of a third or fourth good idea.__Anyone could imagine the better, cleaner, more coherent 90-min. film at the core of Horns: the one about the physics of apparent demonic possession.__Horns is too long and too convoluted, and it doesn't take nearly as many risks as it might have, but in its off-kilter way it has something to say about humankind and the nature of evil.__"Horns" shifts from nifty Gothic thriller to obvious but meaningless allegory.__Radcliffe gives it his all and makes the film worth seeing. But the supernatural story feels scattered.__There are so many red herrings and plot twists, such a dense barrage of flashbacks and quick cuts, that you may find yourself as rattled and breathless as Ig himself.__The movie's anything-goes quality ends up deepening instead of torpedoing the narrative, as can sometimes happen in horror flicks.__What in the world is Mr. Radcliffe doing to himself in his post-Harry Potter movie career? Movies are supposed to be entertaining, and directors are supposed to protect their actors, not expose them to derision.__Heedless of purpose, "Horns" charges full speed ahead anyway, ramming its high-concept hooey down your throat until the only heat you feel is from indigestion.__Demented, twisted and at times gonzo humorous, "Horns" is shamelessly amusing.__Strangely enough, in its thorough devotion to its premise, "Horns" winds up taking concepts of good and evil, god and the devil, and salvation and damnation more seriously than many of the so-called faith-based movies that have come out this year.__Radcliffe looks ready to stretch beyond the black comedy into something grave and mysterious. Director Aja shuts him down - cold. Horns has style to burn, but there's no there there.__However crass and mean-spirited this 2013 fantasy gets, the handling of fairytale conventions is sincere, which gives the film an emotional weight.__The producers were smart to cast Radcliffe, who's always had the air of a martyr. But Radcliffe wasn't smart to tell the producers yes.
A dud.__Turns out accents and attitude only go so far.__A messy, shallow, muddled morass of a Philadelphia crime story set in 1978 ...__What's left is an awkward blend of tragedy and comedy, in a movie that doesn't feel as if it has earned the right to be either.__A fair amount of the film leaves you wondering about the categorizations it's courted as a dark comedy. If the tag legitimately applies, then it takes Slattery a while to find his footing, if he ever really does.__What began as an intriguing snapshot begins to feel grotesque and inscrutable.__Who can quibble when the source material is a novel by Peter Dexter ("Paris Trout"), the debut director is John Slattery ("Mad Men") and the actors are such seasoned pros?__This is Irish gallows humor at its darkest. If that's your cup of ink-black tea, as it is mine, it's a rare treat.__Though the neighborhood of God's Pocket is fictional, and never precisely located, Slattery's rendering of it is vivid and authentic.__Although it contains some interesting characters, "God's Pocket," like the neighborhood it depicts, is the kind of place you can't wait to escape, even if its inhabitants cannot.__In an attempt for restrained, matured respectability, the picture makes even murder seem dull.__Too many of the attempts at "The Sopranos"-style comic drama fail. Maybe the comedy beats are a little off. Or maybe these people are just too gloomy to generate much hilarity.__John Slattery's direction is skilled and steady... Great actors at the top of their game working with rich material.__Slattery goes for lower-depths naturalism, including extensive scenes in a neighborhood bar, and then tries, without sufficient brio, to transform the misery into black comedy.__It's always unfortunate to see potential wasted onscreen, in acting, writing, or directing. It's worse to see it happen all at once with artists universally known as capable of much more.__Slattery adapted the book with Alex Metcalf and gets the tone just right. The film is damnably amusing.__Ultimately "God's Pocket" is a little too much, of everything. And yet not quite enough for Slattery, who deserves something more.__The script, written by director John Slattery and Alex Metcalf, drifts too quickly into blue-collar cliches, leaving its interesting collection of characters only half-drawn at best.__Neither a Scorsesian slice of life nor a social satire, this infuriating movie adds up to almost nothing.__You only wish debuting feature director John Slattery had brought some of the spark he's shown on Mad Men, even when deep in his cups.
A well-made and well-shot companion piece to the album, telling the story of Nas' early life and the circumstances that led to his birth as a hip-hop legend.__Time Is Illmatic does a terrific job of weaving hip-hop history into a highly personal story.__The movie is inspiring and tragic, and, directed by street artist One9, it's captured in an artful, emotional way that will speak to an audience beyond rap fans.__As both an origin story about a great artist and a distillation of '80s urban blight, it's as breathless and real as any street-corner rhyme.__The album lives as a touchstone, and a turning point, in New York hip hop. The film may be far less significant, but it does bear witness to the music's greatness.__Since many of the themes from "Illmatic" have become mere cliches in contemporary rap, this film serves as a reminder of the potential and the promise that hip-hop truly holds.__Nothing seems to get short shrift, including Nas' parentage, childhood, education, and musical beginnings. Yet, at a brisk 75 minutes, the film doesn't overstay its welcome.__Despite some conventional moves here and there and a weakness for the cult of genius, the documentary sustains that uneasy mood cast by Nas's expression as a child on the "Illmatic" cover, sobered by experience and wisdom before his time.__The portrait misses out on discussing cultural impact, but the trade-off is a full-bodied tale of bootstrapping, sure to turn on any budding artist in the audience.__The film understands that the most interesting thing about Nas is how he once converted 20 years of living into 40 minutes of art that transcends its genre, its era, even its medium.__[A] brisk, stylish and extremely heartfelt portrait of Nas' rise from the housing projects of Queensbridge to the heights of hip-hop royalty.__The doc avoids the prefab feel of many similarly targeted music films, instead offering a strong sense of the neighborhood that served as both a rallying cry for musicians who grew up there and a constant threat to their lives.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
[A] moving, observant documentary about the relationship between the ailing 93-year-old legend and master trumpeter Clark Terry and Justin Kauflin, a blind pianist Terry successfully mentored.__"Keep on Keepin' On" might document the passing of a musical torch from one century to the next, but for one sticking point: The first torch plain refuses to go out.__What really makes Keep On Keepin' On such a heart-tugging, three-handkerchief crowd pleaser is that at heart, it's a buddy movie.__Terry produced some of the happiest sounds in the history of jazz; Keep on Keepin' On keeps the smiles coming.__As joyful as a jumping jazz riff, Keep on Keepin' On is an inspiring story of devotion, dedication and multi-generational friendship.__Steadily a portrait emerges of a man who is an inspiration as much for his character as for his talent.__A celebration of music, perseverance and human connection, "Keep on Keepin' On" is for both jazz lovers and lovers of life.__One need not be a jazz aficionado to enjoy this film. All that's required is a smile.__If the film introduces more people to Terry's music, it will have more than served its purpose.__Like too many films on athletes and artists, Keep on Keepin' On seems afraid of going over our heads by examining the technique of its two musicians.__As Terry's health declines, the documentary takes on a rather ghoulish aspect; at one point both his legs have to be amputated, and Jones, himself pushing 80, shows up for an emotional reunion that one assumes will be the men's last.__The stories unfold in parallel, occasionally intertwining, and as one narrative examines a glorious past, the other focuses on an uncertain future.__Terry seems happy just about all the time.__It's genuinely nice to see a man of Terry's stature put his faith in an artist of a younger generation, their bond strengthened by a shared love of music.__Alan Hicks's affectionate and moving look at the relationship between the great trumpeter Clark Terry and Justin Kauflin, a talented young pianist.__The movie hits a beautiful, celebratory note.__Quietly stirring ...__Seeing a living legend laid up in an oxygen tent shouldn't be fun.

The movie bleakly emphasizes the sense of debilitating powerlessness of the average citizen without the means to bring anything but their vote to the ballot box.__If the real triumph of the Tea Party is getting middle- and working-class citizens to vote against their own best interests, it's going to take a documentary more passionate and more revelatory than this one to make that point.__If you have a shred of idealism left, it's hard to watch "Citizen Koch" without a mounting sense of despair and outrage over the influence that money has come to wield over modern elections.__"Citizen Koch" is preaching to the choir. Which might not be a pointless exercise, seeing how the choir failed to show up for the last midterm election in 2010, and might need extra motivation not to repeat that mistake this November.__"Citizen Koch" is undisciplined and depressing, yet still strangely worthwhile.__Most of the movie is a backgrounder on the Citizens United case, in which a deeply divided Supreme Court opened the door to truckloads of campaign cash from tycoons and corporations.__The sad thing is, there are so many unexplored areas here that do deserve films, including a serious investigation of the Kochs.__This imparts such vital information that one can overlook the technical ineptitude.__[The] movie, which starts off shakily, is naggingly diffuse and bumps up against the problem of recounting the freshly remembered past.__While one might agree or disagree with their theme, aesthetically Citizen Koch is feisty.__A spirited, convincing, and eminently watchable bit of agitprop edutainment, Citizen Koch, directed by Carl Deal and Tia Lessin, is the latest liberal riposte to the conservative agenda.__"Citizen Koch" is kind of a mess. But it's a mess well worth discovering for yourself - and consider the history of its production and the situation it tries to capture.__[Offers] up montages of Tea Party screamers rather than investigative reporting or rigorous argumentation.__Snaking through a tangle of interlocking ideas, threads and events, it never quite finds a unified focus.__None__None__None__None__None__None
This doc is a little scrappy, but it's very sweet.__We barely get to know the children or see much of their dancing.

In spite of its insufferably whimsical tendencies - exemplified by its original title, "Oh Boy" - the film may have turned out to be a deeply profound modern postscript about fascism.__Niko's problem is not just that he's spoiled and lazy, but that he's a wimp about it. He only maintains viewer sympathy because everyone else in the film is so obnoxious.__It manages to make an entertaining story out of nothing in particular.

The anger drains out of the picture, and we watch in a state of passive appreciation and indifference.__An acquired taste, this dense Jabberwocky-ish word salad is a political allegory about a populace that's been pharmaceutically duped into believing its wretched world is wonderful.__A half-live-action, half-animated headtrip that throws Robin Wright into a dizzying showbiz paradigm shift.__A dystopian blend of live-action and animation that acidly comments on some of Hollywood's touchiest issues before drifting off into an existential fog.__It's almost painful to watch the immense promise of "The Congress," Ari Folman's spectacularly ambitious experiment, dissipate into nothing.__It's like Folman took several different genres-Hollywood satire, speculative dystopian fiction, family melodrama-and fused them into something amorphous and nebulous.__There's something to be said for a movie that manages to baffle and dazzle in equal measure.

A delightful, sharp dramedy that skewers the topic from every angle imaginable.__Divided into three loosely connected stories involving the same players, "Zero Motivation" is strongest in its characters and its connection to an Israeli reality we can feel even if we've never experienced it.__The office comedy is weak.

The larger questions Coherence asks us to consider about parallel worlds are interesting, if not exactly original, while absurdist touches help elevate it from more traditional thrillers.__At once a suspenseful mind game and a wily mash-up of surreal quantum physics theories, this low-cost thriller proves that something approaching brilliance is not just a function of budget.__The film's not perfect-the hand-held camerawork sometimes distracts from the unnerving mood-but it's a good, spooky mind-bender.__[The] surprises, while cleverly doled out over the film's brisk 88-minute running time, don't entirely offset the general displeasure of spending time with this particular circle of friends, lovers and old flames ...__Coherence is a gentle film, but you walk away from it with your brain on fire.__What began as a nifty puzzle feels more like a trap.

Brazilian writer-director Daniel Ribeiro displays an assured sense of tone in this debut feature, sustaining an air of fragile beauty but never once slipping into preciousness.__Ribeiro lacks a sense of dramatic construction, with the narrative stumbling about thoughtlessly, retracing the same ground over and over.__A warm, smart and thoroughly delightful coming-of-age story.__"Admirable throughout is the balance that Ribeiro strikes between dewy eroticism and the contextualization of sexuality as just a single aspect of one's identity, albeit an essential one."__The Way He Looks almost collapses at several points into a saccharine mess, but Ribeiro manages to keep the dramatic tension alive.__With his saccharine ending, writer-director Daniel Ribeiro puts escapist entertainment above meaningfully addressing the challenges faced by disabled or gay youths.__The movie feels like the gentle first chapter in Leo's story; life and love stretch out ahead of him, like a deliciously winding road.__The pleasures of understatement abound in the assured drama "The Way He Looks," a quiet, closely observed high school romance set in Sao Paulo, Brazil.__Ribeiro has an uncanny eye for the telling emotional gesture, and "The Way He Looks" is full of them.__The movie's overarching compassion does count for a lot.__Ribeiro poignantly reminds us of unexpected first loves and the triumphs of being attracted to someone who truly cares about and understands you.__The film's happy ending is ... worthy of a teenage sneer.__The sweet and beautifully observed feature debut of Brazilian writer-director Daniel Ribeiro.__Everyone will root for the two teen protags in Daniel Ribeiro's sweet gay coming-of-age debut, The Way He Looks, since the boys are so likable and their route to first love has an undeniably touching quality.__This portrait of love and friendship among middle-class teens in Sao Paulo is sweet and sensitive, even if it has little especially new to say.__None__None__None__None__None
Most fascinating is the seemingly unanimous feeling that while deployment in Korengal was hard and heartbreaking, these veterans would do it all again just to stay together, to remain brothers who mutually understand something no on else will ever know.__In a series of expertly edited interviews conducted with infantrymen on their way home after a year in the Korengal Valley, Junger exposes us to the war's psychological toll.__"Restrepo" felt like the story of how boys become men. "Korengal" feels like the story of how strangers become family.__Those of us who haven't served on active duty can't know what it's like. Taken together, "Restrepo" and "Korengal" brings us about as close to the experience as we can, or would want, to get.__The film is a tribute to the courage, tenacity and sorrow of the men with their boots on the ground in a place very far away.__They hash out the manifold ordeals of their service, but rarely does anything startlingly new emerge -- which is not to say that the film doesn't have value. War is hell and always will be.__The first film was for us. This one's for them.__The focus is on the psychology of wartime existence, descriptions of sights, sounds and feelings, girded by the verite footage rather than driven by it.__Sebastian Junger delivers a worthy companion piece to 'Restrepo' with this more reflective dispatch from the front lines of Afghanistan.__"Korengal" is a collective meditation on military life by many of the same men, looking back on their time in Afghanistan.__Korengal deals with memories rather than realities, and yet leaves those memories unexamined.__The film is passionate, but not exactly revelatory.__More conventional, but more introspective than its predecessor.__As a record of the war, the two films are imperishable.__None__None__None__None__None__None
The ho-hum story is hardly what you'd call grand opera.__The goose bumps are undeniable. You may as well just give in.__Feel-good stories feel good for a reason, and this one is practically operatic.__David Frankel's film reduces an extraordinary life to a predictable template of bullying, resolve, success, disappointment, and platitudes - a pattern repeated two or three times until the genuinely moving finale.__Delivers a screen version of Mr. Potts's life with straightforward crowd-pleasing instincts and more than a dollop of schmaltz.__There's never really terribly much at stake here, except the success of one chubby nerd with dreams of nailing Puccini's "Nessun dorma." But maybe that dream is enough.__The film is, indeed, a bit pat. Sweet and funny - largely thanks to James Corden in the lead role - it's never particularly surprising.__It's a film that swears by the golden formula of crowd-pleasing sentimentality: Let viewers laugh at the struggles and share in the triumphs.__"Billy Elliot" fans will likely adore this tale of a sensitive lad misunderstood by his macho dad. Everyone else will find it tepid.__The film shoehorns Potts's life story into a familiar underdog template ...__A sweet, funny, heartfelt film, and while we may know all along how it all turns out, Paul's signature performance still gives us chills.__The problem with the film is that Paul Potts's life story has been put through the Hollywood meatgrinder.__An utterly formulaic but sweet movie that does what a crowd-pleaser is meant to do.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The movie's an eyeful, though, thanks to the intricate production design and many artworks on display; it's also an earful, thanks to Ennio Morricone's fittingly lush score.__"The Best Offer" is at its best when it's decidedly weird.__An uneven but weirdly mesmerizing drama/thriller, Giuseppe Tornatore's "The Best Offer" offers an acting showcase to Geoffrey Rush.__Italian writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore... designs beautiful sets around Virgil, who holds the screen in nearly every shot.__The film has several smart twists and surprises up its well-tailored sleeve.__If its destination is patently obvious from the outset, the journey does at least offer scattered pleasures.__An intriguingly Hitchcockian premise gradually takes on a preposterous air in the art-world noir "The Best Offer."__Part of the pleasure in watching The Best Offer is the elegant, unassumingly suspenseful way it unfolds.__Geoffrey Rush brings striking depth of character to a classic Old World mystery set against the sophisticated backdrop of Europe's art auctions, with charming input from Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland.__The pic uses the polish of faux-sophistication and the cliched old-man/nubile-woman fantasy to distract viewers from dissecting the plot.__Mr. Rush can't fly far on Mr. Tornatore's dialogue and workmanlike plotting, and Sylvia Hoeks, as Claire, doesn't bring a corresponding energy.__None of it comes together in any satisfying way, unfortunately, because Tornatore telegraphs every revelation with head-slapping amateurishness.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
A dark piece of neorealism - and a searing indictment of Eastern Europe's newly moneyed classes ...__A Romanian political allegory - in Romanian - might sound like tough sledding, but thanks to a searing performance by Luminita Gheorghiu, "Child's Pose" is anything but.__Perversely engrossing thanks to Gheorghiu's performance as the queen of denial.__Netzer crafts not only a chilling story of family dysfunction, but also an illuminating look into the corruption and decay of the Romanian bourgeoisie - without ever overplaying his hand. It all appears so effortless, when in fact it's so skillful.__A fascinating, troubling and finally controversial portrait of maternal anxiety at its most smotheringly neurotic.__A tour-de-force performance from Gheorghiu carries this 2013 drama along, but Radulescu provides the fine edge, noting how this lioness cloaks her selfish crusade in a plea for humanity.__It's a chilly story, shot with claustrophobic, close-in cameras, right up to its abrupt ending - in which a mother learns, to her horror, something about the kind of pain that isn't easily swept away.__Of all the great monster mothers in cinema history, Cornelia Keneres (Luminita Gheorghiu, who sets the standard that other performances should be judged by this year) ranks high on the list.__It's well worth seeing, both for its merciless anatomization of the country's post-Ceausescu social order and for Gheorghiu's stupendous central performance as a mother so monstrous she makes Medea look like a pushover.__If Child's Pose fails to live up to its indie-intellectual veneer, it earns its keep through Gheorgiu, whose Cornelia is a triumph of subtle performance over crude conception.__In the movie world, most national new waves don't last long. An exception is the Romanian renaissance, which has featured first-class movies now for more than a decade.__"Child's Pose" sounds like something simple and easy, but don't be fooled.__Writer-director Calin Peter Netzer's thin yet compelling movie is a family drama with elements of political theater and film noir.__When the stars are aligned-the writing and direction along with the stars in front of the camera-a movie can put the most appalling characters on display and still make them engrossing.__The movie creates its own tightening vice grip.__The drained, exhausted, stifling mood is a frequently punitive experience for the viewer.__Sporting a blonde dye job and a haughty, impervious manner, Gheorghiu makes Cornelia a consistently compelling figure, at once monstrous and pathetic.__A drama with a story as cold, merciless and inevitable as a tomb ...__Netzer keeps faith with his countrymen's gritty aesthetic, which remains pure in the spirit of New Wave neo-realism; somehow, international success has not made the Romanians crave CGI or encouraged them to pander to hipness.__It's wonderful to see [Gheorghiu] in a leading role, especially one as meaty as this.
As progressive as it might feel for fat guys, losers and salsa stalwarts, it's rotten for women__It's not a bad gimmick, but the movie turns tediously sentimental fast.__Ultimately, the film rides on Frost, who carries it with charm, grace and plenty of heart.__It ends up feeling a little like warmed-over Strictly Ballroom without Baz Lurhmann's over-the-top sense of style.__A little more fury might have been a whole lot better.__There's nothing groundbreaking in "Cuban Fury," but it's a pleasant diversion starring the always amiable Nick Frost, with Chris O'Dowd relishing his role as a slimeball.__Not that some of this isn't amusing, but you feel the considerable improvisational skills of the cast going to waste.__Jon Brown's script, while good-natured, is overly predictable. But despite the challenges, Frost proves himself an unexpectedly nimble lead.__[It] has its laugh-out-loud moments. Most, unfortunately, come fairly late in the picture.__It wants to be a feel-good movie, but it's really just a "feel-meh" flick.__Don't let the cheesy title deter you. "Cuban Fury" is a thoroughly engaging crowd-pleaser - sweet, quite amusing and even a tad inspiring.__A rather unremarkable, if endearing, entry in the quirky rom-com genre.__Frost is credited with the "original idea," a fanciful phrase given the highly formulaic story, but he and Jones are charming together.__Frost has all it takes to run his own show. Now he just needs a better show.__Cuban Fury has a surprising amount of fun with these acknowledged cliches. At times, the movie has the energy of an Anchorman-style spoof ...__Cuban Fury feels like the product of a computer program that was fed a dozen screenwriting manuals and synthesized the ultimate generic rom-com.__Overall, it's just enough to send the date-movie crowd home with a smile on their face and a tingle of joy in their heart.__Busts a few minor moves, but not as light on its feet as it wants to be.__Counts on its super-game cast to feel their way through a script that, however droll in concept, is surprisingly short on clear punchlines.__None
It's as retrograde - if also as perversely intoxicating - as an old Hollywood melodrama.__Reactions to this exercise in revisionism may vary from sympathy, if you believe everyday Germans were also Hitler's victims, to indignation, if you consider them his accomplices.__Though director Philipp Kadelbach and screenwriter Stefan Kolditz do touch on moral ambiguities ... they settle comfortably into glib ironies, bittersweet platitudes, and sentiment passing as tragedy.__"Generation War" has a texture and an interest that American stories do not.__Certainly entertaining, possibly art, not always convincing but most assuredly a soap.__In all, "Generation War" has the strengths and weaknesses of middlebrow art-it may be clunky, even embarrassing, but it's certainly never dull.__I suppose everything that occurs in "Generation War" is factually possible, even when it's not based on fact. But weirdly little of it feels historically plausible, at least to one foreigner's eyes and ears.__The reasons why some Germans have hailed it as a spur to soul-searching may remain opaque to an American watching all 4&#8201;/&#8322; hours in a theater.__Overly melodramatic but fairly engrossing ...__Serves up nearly five hours of self-pitying Third Reich youth, in a film shot through with heavy ironies and scored as if it were The Shawshank Redemption.__As television drama, Generation War is unquestionably effective. As dramatized history, it is pretty questionable.__Viewers require more from the plight of these characters ... than the film is equipped to give.__Sure enough, you'll be zipped along in the manner of plotty, decently acted binge-watching.

"Pump" is fascinating at times, although the quick cutting and constant music take away from some engrossing moments.__As far as documentaries go, the film is exhaustively researched, interviewed and documented.__As filmmaking, "Pump" sometimes resembles a Super Bowl commercial.__"Pump" is quite entertaining, drawing together colorful archival footage, interviewed experts and ordinary folk ... in a lively, professional package.__Compelling and cogent ...__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
There's something flimsy and unformed at these characters' cores, something that no amount of jumpy close-ups, skittering sideways glances, and rainy music can make up for.__Buoyed by some nicely nuanced performances (especially by Pearce and Amy Ryan as his dream-dashing wife), Breathe In never quite rises above its predictable potboiler premise.__Every moment between stars Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones feels so much like an explosion about to go off that viewers may hesitate to so much as take a breath at the wrong time for fear of disturbing the film's delicate equilibrium.__A breathy tale of a not-quite love affair, Drake Doremus' "Breathe In" is yet another skillfully acted indie drama that's never quite good enough to be memorable.__The superb acting can't turn narrative lead into gold with this story about the attraction of a foreign-exchange student pianist to her married host and teacher.__The film needs more help than it gets from the script, which turns on facile coincidence and dwindles in originality as it moves toward its climax.__Although Jones and Pearce are interesting when onscreen alone, their chemistry is slightly off.__Falters with a bland and predictable emotional connection.__Doremus' beautifully shot, naturalistic style means there are no soap-opera hysterics, and he gets strong performances from all involved...But it's hard to get over the fact that Jones, who was born in 1983, is far too old to play a high school student.__Felicity Jones, who is actually 30, makes Sophie both irresistible and real, a somewhat open book of wonder and innate wisdom.__Despite its title's implied urge to relax, refresh, recharge, "Breathe In" remains just a little too calm - and ultimately airless.__Breathe In is all simmer, no boil, despite an abrupt, overwrought, agonizing emotional climax that's too much, too late.__"Breathe In" is a good enough movie that you wish the screenplay had further fleshed out its characters and relationships and emerged as more than a skillful sketch.__It's a maddening mix of realistic characters, fine performances, ponderous pacing and oppressive mood lighting, none of which serve to cover up one central, glaring problem: a romance that never feels real.__This indie drama by Drake Doremus impressed me with the amount of mileage it gets from the simple premise without the affair even being consummated.__There's low-key, and then there's limp.__Sometimes, when it comes to getting across specific themes or ideas, creating a mood can do even more than developing a story or writing dialogue.__The May-December romance is an overworked genre, but steady hands guide this one with intelligence to a sad but satisfactory conclusion.__Top performances by Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones ... make the film emotionally rich.__Not that May-December romances can't be compelling, but it's hard to root for a guy in his forties to find the courage to make time with a barely legal girl, no matter how dissatisfied he is with his life.
The movie is DOA from scene one and is never resuscitated.__Life After Beth starts feeling more conventional the wilder and darker it gets.__Once it's safely slotted in the overworked zom-com genre, there's no reason to keep watching.__Baena co-wrote "I Heart Huckabees" and while he has a sense of humor, the jokes here tend to be meager and tend to dribble on.__While Baena tries to offer a reworking of zombie mythology - easy-listening music makes them horny and they have a fascination with attics and smearing dirt on walls - the movie doesn't live up to the promise of its dark start.__Among many missteps is a total tonal identity crisis. Plaza has described Beth as a "zom-com-rom-dram." (N.B. This remark is more clever than anything in the movie it describes.)__Halfway through, the story loses momentum, becoming a listless, predictable Saturday Night Live skit.__The movie runs out of steam, though not blood, long before it's over.__"Life After Beth" may have revived the ultimate girlfriend from hell, but it's still wan, listless and derivative in bringing her to undead life.__A quirky spirit pervasive throughout and great supporting cast, including Anna Kendrick, make it a semi-satisfying "zomb-edy."__This is a talented comedic cast, but in the second half of the film they don't get to do a lot that's funny.__Plaza, whose wide-eyed stare suggests a zombie as painted by Margaret Keane, plausibly navigates Beth's journey into full-throttle Linda Blair demonic dementia.__"Life After Beth" gets into the well-tread zombie-comedy territory in a clever and inspired way. Then it doesn't get out of it nearly so skillfully.__A nicely strange, and often strangely fun movie - and, unlike most of the summer's comedies, a film with some brains. Even if it only wants to eat them.__Seasoned actors are left to yell pointlessly at one another, while Beth and the zombie angle slowly decompose.__First-time writer-director Baena casts the film slyly and directs individual sequences with a lot of sneaky wit.__Starts with promise and has some darkly funny scenes but grows listless, repetitive and plodding, the cinematic equivalent of a zombie.__Even if Life After Beth is a unique entry in the zombie canon, it still registers as overkill. One gets the sense that Mr. Baena should have let this one die.__It may be time to put the zombie trend to rest. At least that's what writer-director Jeff Baena's initially promising, and ultimately disappointing, directorial debut suggests.__The film just kind of sits there, gradually escalating a zombie apocalypse and hoping that having the zombies retain a smidgen of humanity as they turn homicidal will somehow automatically yield hilarity and poignancy.
They reject the youth-culture diktat that age makes you invisible, and offer us all an example of self-acceptance.__"Advanced Style" is appropriately fun, frivolous and baroquely ornamented by its subjects who sing, perform, model and occasionally sound like teenagers, while dressing a lot better.__The way the women occupy Cohen and Plioplyte's spotlight is a lesson in aging well, a lesson that begins with the refusal to play by the rule that says to grow older, especially for women, is to fade into the shadows.__These women are living life to the fullest - and they are inviting us to do the same.__Inspired by Ari Seth Cohen's blog by the same name, "Advanced Style" is a love letter to older women who've elevated dressing to an art form.__"Advanced Style" is undeniably captivating, even uplifting at times.__The radiant personalities of the women, and their penchant for giving new life to old platitudes, allow Advanced Style to get by without much of a narrative trajectory or shape of any kind.__Ultimately, Advanced Style presents these women not as objects of curiosity, but as what they truly are: role models.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
With only 74 slowly unfolding shots, it's closer to gallery installation than conventional cinema, but for audiences open to the experience, it's inexplicably compelling.__Non-narrative films can be opaque in deep ways.

And aestheticizing it in this way doesn't make the message any more convincing or urgent.__The "oh, come off it" art movie of 2014.__Reggio has talked about his movies as attempts to bypass the intellect, a "visceral form of cinema" that's "aimed at your solar plexus." But you may experience "Visitors" as more of a sedative than a punch in the guts.__"Visitors" restores a sense of monumentality to a medium that has seemed so diminished by recent technological and commercial imperatives ...__This is a dialogue-free documentary composed of beautiful black-and-white photography set to an atmospheric Philip Glass score, and it's a patience-straining exercise in narrative asceticism.__Godfrey Reggio's Visitors is as much a Zen experience as it is a movie, although as the latter it can be quite astonishing, too - cinema that envelops and enthralls.__It all sounds quite convincing in theory, but in practice this melange of imagery is aimed more at the inside of Reggio's head than anywhere else.__We see unadorned faces staring at the camera; afternoon shadows moving across a large, institutional-looking building; forlorn images of an abandoned amusement park; the misty, magical quiet of a swamp.__As it glides along from one pretty picture to the next, Visitors starts to feel less like a singular artistic gesture than a compendium of quasi-experimental film cliches.__Visitors is far from the master's best film, but I know I'll be haunted by it for a while.__For better or worse, I've never seen anything quite like it.__Godfrey Reggio's latest movie, "Visitors," has all of the pretensions and none of the pop of his earlier work.__A tedious Rorschach test whose novelty depends on discounting much of the history of photographic, cinematic, and gallery art.__The word for the film is transfixing.__Many of the children whose faces are shown in the film were shot as they looked at video games; their expressions suggest that whatever they were watching was a lot more fascinating than this.__Walkouts and snores are to be expected, although those on the film's meditative wavelength will be held rapt.__Entrancing images will awe some viewers and leave others scratching their heads.__[Reggio's] formal devices haven't changed in 30 years, and the po-faced presentation, once hypnotically strange and cosmic, now feels like an overused gimmick.
They've found a way of serving up these images without seeming callous or exploitative or preachy.__Although the visuals are spectacular - a barren Colorado River looks like a landscape from a science-fiction epic - there's not much else here to grab on.__As in Manufactured Landscapes, the long shots of natural and man-made environments have a patterned, abstract beauty that often chafes against the ugly truth on the ground.__It relies heavily on visuals and offers minimal context. The project has a pro-environment feeling, which comes across implicitly, not through browbeating or preaching.__It's the majesty and beauty of water at its most pure that stays with us longest.__At 92 minutes, the production is stately, unhurried yet crisply focused, never overstaying its welcome.__Here's a case of images in the service of important ideas, rather than entertainment, yet they could hardly be more powerful, from roaring torrents released by a dam in China to a lyrical helicopter shot of a glistening river in British Columbia.__It's as if the movie's many pieces are supposed to be like impressionistic brush strokes. When seen together, the result is pretty to look at. But it's not as meaningful as it should be.__These exceptionally gifted filmmakers are simply best at the long view of the human species and its impact.__A Canadian photographer dedicated to chronicling how man affects the environment turns his attention from land to water with mesmerizing results.__Always arresting and sometimes troubling, "Watermark" - aside from the odd comment here and there - neither lectures nor argues.__Unfortunately, while the documentary's points are clear, its desire to articulate them primarily through contrasts neuters some of its persuasiveness.__Watermark is a documentary filled with images both beautiful and wrenching, yet the film as a whole is a disappointment.__It's meant to inspire us to think about our relationship with water and how we use it, and in this it succeeds admirably.__None__None__None__None__None__None
A short, pungent, ambiguous portrait of the poorer sections of Baltimore and the young men who get their kicks riding dirt bikes through the streets en masse, popping wheelies and dodging the police.__Documentary filmmaker Lotfy Nathan explores the outlaw appeal of an inner-city Baltimore dirt-bike gang through the eyes of a 13-year-old wannabe member named Pug.__It could have romanticized its subjects, portraying them as outlaws and folk heroes. Or it could have gone the way of moral panic. To its credit, [it] does neither of these things - or, rather, it does both, in the most subtle and insightful way possible.__Take a closer look, as Lofty Nathan does in his freewheeling debut feature... and bike gangs like the 12 O'Clock Boys start to differentiate as more than just a dangerous nuisance.__[Pug is] a fiercely individual child, but, inevitably, his predicament also symbolizes how poverty can warp a good boy's nature.__"12 O'Clock Boys" packs more life into its 72 minutes than many longer documentaries do.__In this transfixing documentary about a Baltimore boy striving to join illegal urban dirt bikers, first-time filmmaker Lofty Nathan conjures a unique journalistic excitement.__The young filmmaker rarely digs beneath the harsh environment's many fraught surfaces. He simply lets his cameras be his guide.__The film's implication, that the rides need to be curtailed, seems obvious; and I can't help thinking that Nathan realizes this, but stops short.__Nathan's film defies easy categorization; he's interested in neither telling a fairy tale nor painting issues in broad strokes.__Nathan wisely avoids explicit commentary. He doesn't need it: Coco's angry frustration, Pug's bruised confusion, and the police helicopters constantly hovering above the defiant bikers say enough.__Its rhythm is the jagged rhythm of everyday life, and its primary asset is its unemphatic authenticity, offering a window into a very specific time and place.__This visually stunning, thematically complex documentary will stir up a wide range of reactions.__Engrossing if slightly slapdash.__In slow-motion shots, Nathan captures the riders' pride in mastery and thrill in adventure.__The film itself is a little too rough around the edges to fully engage.

If the film has a major flaw, it's the profusion of subplots in a 100-minute running time. Still, it is a real accomplishment.__"Fort McCoy" is an obvious labor of love. That doesn't make it a good movie, but it's a nice sentiment all the same.__The period details are so lovingly burnished in this uneven, if heartfelt, feature that for a while they threaten to overpower the story, which delves gently into a rarely explored aspect of the war.__A heartfelt, personal film with great performances aims for the stars and falls back to earth.__An old-fashioned, appealingly sentimental drama about homefront life during WWII.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

"Better Living Through Chemistry" as a whole feels rather superficial and safe.__By the time the film gets to its ridiculous stretch of an ending, we've all seen the great fun to be had with drugs while also learning of their danger. How convenient.

But ultimately, and deliberately, safe.__A tepid but pleasant comic satire given a shot of contemporaneity by its writing and directing team, Geoff Moore and David Posamentier, and its star Sam Rockwell.__Too bad; with this cast, "Better Living Through Chemistry" could have been a lot more fun.__It's tough to feel pity for a guy who blames everyone else for his misery, and even harder to appreciate filmmakers who encourage his entitlement.__Maybe writer-directors Geoff Moore and David Posamentier were sampling some of the mind-numbing products featured in their black comedy ... which might account for its lack of wit, imagination or other cerebral effort.__"Better Living Through Chemistry" does have its moments, and there are quite a few laughs. It tries too hard, but at least it's trying.__A bit of a cheat - and goes soft in the clutch.__The end result of this stoned-cold picnic is both haphazardly successful and somewhat disappointing, but it's worth seeing, thanks enormously to the tremendous charisma of Sam Rockwell.__Every character is a pretty well-worn archetype, including Michelle Monaghan's uptight, exercise-obsessed wife.__A droll but unsatisfying film ...__None__None__None__None__None__None

It feels more like a poem. Or, at times, a symphony. But it's much less effective as an actual movie.__"God tells truths in parables," someone says - a line that Edwards most likely aspires to take possession of, as if his poetic, pictorial parable had its own truths to tell.__The narrative is gentle and sparse.

The tone of the picture seems perversely oblique.__Just as those around Lincoln grow frustrated by his obscurity, so may audiences watching "The Better Angels."__Whereas other directors have presented the man in mythic terms, "The Better Angels" renders young Abe relatable, provided auds are willing to put themselves on the film's wavelength.__All that extensively researched authenticity and soul-stirring cinematography go only so far in establishing a compelling connection to a specific time and place.__The sense of predestination hangs heavily over the movie, but not a sense of life.__If you succumb to "The Better Angels," the effect is like falling into a gorgeous photograph, but that also means the narrative in this arthouse film is oblique and sketchy.__It comes across as an apprentice work, not unlike the second-rate versions of paintings created by students who would work at the side of Renaissance masters.__Rendering the life of young Abraham Lincoln as a tone poem, "The Better Angels" sags under the weight of its own resolute earnestness.__The overall effect is close to parody, tinged by a frustrating coyness that refuses to identify its protagonist (Braydon Denney) by name for the entire running time.__Kruger and Clarke do their best to look steadfast with a camera swooping around them like a wounded bird, but there's no rescuing this imprecise family portrait from its own impulses toward obscurity.__Those who appreciate Mr. Edwards' appropriation of Mr. Malick's approach will find "The Better Angels" lives up to its aspirations; those with no patience for shots of wind on crops will find the film crashes on the sharp-rocked shore of its pretensions.__Thanks to its indelible image-making and dedication to what could be termed lyrical realism, The Better Angels notably succeeds in creating a vivid impression of the physical and familial circumstances that crucially shaped [Lincoln's] heart and mind.__None__None
Flawed as it is, "River" reminds us where all the great music came from.__Three of the guitar marvels shown here - Hubert Sumlin, Teenie Hodges and Skip Pitts - have died since filming. This is a marginal but worthwhile footnote to their legacy.__The premise for this documentary couldn't be more stilted, and some of the matchups are enough to make you wince. But there are a few striking intergenerational moments.__"Take Me to the River" includes just enough history of the civil rights era to lend it gravitas. The color-blind recording practices of studios like Stax were an anomaly at the time and are well worth noting.__"Take Me to the River" is at its most interesting when zeroing in on the back-and-forth between musicians of different eras ...__An often vibrant documentary about the making of an album of the same title, seeking to connect generations.__"Take Me to the River" falls woefully short on offering a serious contribution to the history of African American-inspired music.__You can't help but feel all the palpable joy is eliding some darker realities that would lend the copious musical performances a deeper resonance.__The cross-generational collaborations begin to click when musicians who found fame in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s recall the importance of mentors on their careers and demonstrate an eagerness to pass on their accumulated wisdom.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Meet Ralph Steadman and his nightmare visions of a world in pain, revealed in a mesmerizing documentary.__The film makes it clear that not only was Steadman perfect for Thompson's work (and a big part of his success), his work stands on its own artistically.__Giving an overlooked luminary his due is reason enough for "For No Good Reason."__As wonderful as it is to watch the man work, and to review many of the startling images he created over the years, the film has its dead spots.__This is most worthwhile for its scenes of Steadman at work, flinging ink all over the place and turning the splatter marks into his signature grotesques.__For No Good Reason sidelines Steadman's own bona fides, functioning primarily as a second-hand documentary of Thompson, stoking the hagiography of the late hipster icon.__Though we don't get to know Steadman the man all that well (rough time at boarding school, and yes, he has a wife and a dog), we do get to know his art.__Lovingly detailed with animated and archival imagery.__Portrait of the artist as a young (and old) gonzo.__There's no more exciting effect in the documentary than the look of pure pleasure on Depp's face as he stands by Steadman's drawing table, peeking over his shoulder as he attacks a sheet of paper.__The most rewarding parts of the film feature Steadman simply talking about his influences (Picasso, among others) and his youthful goal of changing the world through art.__Ultimately it's a fan letter, full of more awe and loving than "Fear and Loathing," and meant mostly for other admirers.__"For No Good Reason" is less revealing than a standard hourlong television tribute might have been. We learn almost nothing about Mr. Steadman's life, and too little about the non-Thompson-related aspects of his oeuvre.__Depp does a fine job of narrating unobtrusively, negotiating Steadman's free-ranging musings and keeping them on track. Steadman is genial, witty and self-deprecating.__The salient, liveliest parts of For No Good Reason - the title comes from Thompson's reply when Steadman once asked him, "Why are we doing this?" - are to be found in the artist's display of his work and recollections of the eccentrics he met.__[It becomes] less interesting as it stretches to feature length, sometimes resembling a handsomely illustrated CV.__The result is a bit unwieldy, casting too wide a net to really plumb its subject's depths, and defanging some of Steadman's acid wit with an overly busy, hit-and-miss aesthetic approach.__When a documentary feels the urge to shout about its celebrity cast with a lengthy, elaborate opening-credits sequence, could it be making up for shortcomings elsewhere?__For No Good Reason details the famed wild-man cartoonist's career with a stylistic daring that doesn't quite match its subject's, but is nonetheless in keeping with his unconventional spirit.__Visually impressive but ultimately unrevealing.
The relentless calamity becomes a grind, offering few insights beyond ones that are obvious in the first half hour.__In adapting the novel, Szasz and screenwriters Tom Abrams and Andras Szeker tread carefully, leaving a lot to the imagination ...__A bleak, despairing testament to the cruelty of war, and how it mangles and defaces everyone it touches.__If only I could figure out what all this was meant to stand for.__Thoroughly unpleasant and at the same time completely unedifying.__Not a movie for those who insist on happy resolutions, "The Notebook" is instead a study in how the nihilistic worldview that clouds the collective Eastern Europe sensibility came to be.__By the end, you may feel exhausted by the parade of horrors. But veteran Hungarian director Janos Szasz has the courage of his convictions, refusing to provide breathing room or false optimism.__Alternately powerful and perplexing.__Szasz keeps the kids at such an emotional distance that even their notebook -- in which their father has commanded they commit everything they do, and think - does little to generate much emotional investment.__This cautionary tale certainly has a chilling and timely message of how wars make monsters out of innocent people.__"The Notebook" is a skillfully made movie, with sequences that may haunt you after you leave the theater.__Straddling nihilism and a moral fastidiousness so "pure" it flirts with the very fascism it means to critique, The Notebook cedes not one solitary inch to humanism.__Though it features no battle scenes, The Notebook shines a powerful, unflinching light on the horrors of World War II.__Not a shred of human decency is on display in The Notebook, a handsomely made, hard-to-endure World War II parable set in an unnamed Hungarian backwater during the Nazi occupation of 1944.__Director Janos Szasz's sense of atmosphere is suitably chilling, but that's undermined by a lack of focus and broad-stroke portrayals.__[A] sobering wartime drama ...__None__None__None__None
While certainly no love story, this dry-eyed tale feels achingly, maybe even exhilaratingly alive.__Conventional dramatic hooks have no place in Garrel's filmography, so it's not surprising that his new movie is more atmospheric than involving, or that the two beautiful bed heads at its center hardly invite emotional connection.__There's a casualness at work here that's absorbing because Garrel doesn't make a moment mean more than it ought to.__In a brief 77 minutes, "Jealousy" provides a remarkably full - and also an intriguingly partial - portrait of a group of struggling artists as no-longer-entirely-young men and women.__Quiet moments after big decisions are where the power lies in this absorbing French drama.__Philippe Garrel's movies feel like ghost stories: delicate, enigmatic, and haunted by some indelible, unnameable presence, which a viewer can't help but suspect is the director's own past.__"Jealousy" has a quiet melancholy that's very pleasing.__Vital and vigorous even when its characters feel scraped of vigor/vitality, Philippe Garrel's latest finds boho Parisians facing the ends of marriages, affairs, and the feasibility of bohemian existence itself.__In comparison with near-impenetrable Garrel efforts like Regular Lovers (2005) and Frontier of the Dawn (2008), Jealousy cuts straight to the heart.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Unfortunately, Troell chose to shoot the movie in digital black-and-white; the imagery seems anachronistic in its precision, undermining the period decor and clashing with the occasional low-grain newsreel footage of Nazis on the march.__Troell invokes '50's and '60's Swedish cinema: masterly black-and-white cinematography, philosophical angst, a lifeless marriage and loved ones visiting from the afterlife.__It's a thoughtful and workmanlike portrait, but a less than profoundly moving one.__Amazingly, Troell still operates his own camera. "The Last Sentence" was made digitally, and his attention to detail is remarkable.__The great 83-year-old Swedish director Jan Troell specializes in movies about men of great stature in furious conflict with both their countries and themselves.__A more sophisticated work than it appears about a man whose life was more complicated than the world knew.__A master psychological filmmaker, Jan Troell, puts a towering anti-Nazi crusader under his microscope in the urgently compelling biopic The Last Sentence.__It's too bad that the movie can't find his pulse and instead delivers a tastefully bland, inert portrait of a man whose personal ugliness it acknowledges without excavating.__A richly detailed portrait of a great man riddled with flaws and undone by adulation.__It's a must-see for those who have followed Mr. Troell's career, and a should-see for those who can look past its oddities to its cumulative power.__This is a handsome movie, rich in period detail, but the stately pace slows to a crawl in the second half.__[Troell] is a great and restrained director, seldom extravagant or showy, but trusting of actors, decor, and a relentless attention to mixed motives.__We know what Segerstedt did, and Troell tries to ask why. What he ignores are the implications.__[The film] offers a potentially intriguing study in high-minded political/moral obstinacy, but feels too claustrophobic -- and, finally, tediously like a one-man window on great events -- to fully come to dramatic life.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Simple but engrossing, Canadian director Richie Mehta's Siddharth is the story of an Indian father searching for his missing son, and offers a window into the lives of India's working poor that goes beyond the familiar issues of food and shelter.__Tension builds along with hopelessness but Mehta avoids making judgments or giving easy answers about the circumstances that led to Siddharth being sent off to work.__Though at times "Siddharth" can resemble a well-photographed report on India's social and economic ills, Mehta subtly employs different styles to sustain the poetry, poignancy, and drama.__"Siddharth" provides something more valuable than a tidy resolution: a glimpse of the complicated nature of life a world away.__Like Vittorio De Sica's "The Bicycle Thief," the film uses downbeat themes to make a point about this particular society and life in general.__A spare, lean, and decidedly unsettling account of the ugly reality of child labor and child abduction in India.__Part of what makes "Siddharth" so troubling and moving is the difficulty we have situating our sympathies.__It all feels very real.__A film of subdued but mounting panic and grief - an unsentimental portrait of poverty in contemporary India and of a benighted man's efforts to understand the world beyond his workaday struggles.__Its portrayal of impoverished, careworn people barking at one another and protecting their territory in a daily struggle is bracingly hardheaded.__For all its scenes of orphans and hardscrabble street life, and its spirit of shrugging helplessness, Siddharth always feels ferociously personal.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
For Francophiles of a literary bent, just hearing these two actors silkily unfurling their lines will be frisson enough__This may be a buddy comedy on its surface, but "Bicycling With Moliere" also gives some insight into the way art imitates life, and also the way life informs art.__It deals lightly with topics like ego, friendship, rivalry and love, and it does so within the context of an exploration of the personal and professional lives of a pair of actors.__As long as it's putting Moliere through a Pirandellian prism, Bicycling With Moliere is sophisticated fun.__An amiable French buddy comedy, "Bicycling With Moliere" is worth a ride.__A comedy that frequently crosses the line separating breezy from flimsy, to be marginally enjoyed and then completely forgotten.__The screenplay ultimately bears out Alceste's observations about treachery, selfishness and deceit, but with such charm and zest that their sting tickles more than it hurts.__Kinda like "The Trip," only with Moliere in place of salmon mousse.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
In trying to create a balanced portrait of the conflicts and the ordinary people affected by them, director Michael Berry... chips away at the authenticity and intensity that an issue-driven film like this sorely needs.__It captures the desperation of illegal immigrants and the confused rancor that often greets them on the American side of the border.__The actors are compelling, and the issue is, of course, always worth discussion. It's not a great movie, but, if nothing else, Frontera is worthwhile on those fronts.__"Frontera" is a well-cast, well-made, well-acted drama that you will probably forget about soon after you've seen it.__You wish that a filmmaker like John Sayles had grabbed the story by the throat and teased out its complexities.__The modern, gritty Western "Frontera" takes a lot of the cliches and delicately upends them to tell a tale about undocumented immigrants.__No polemic, it's a poignant tale of human decency and redemption.__There's a fine line between foreshadowing and telegraphing, and Frontera does plenty of the latter.__"Frontera" offers an unsparing look at the plight of illegal immigrants, even if the ending seems too patly convenient.__Middling if still very watchable ...__It's no polemic, but neither is it as character-driven as it aims to be.__Frontera is a showcase for actors: Ed Harris, in particular, does something we've seen him do before -- play the laconic man of principle -- but he's so good at it, you warm right up to his rhythms.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"Wetlands" tells a fairly conventional story in about the most unconventional ways imaginable.__Even if Wetlands were far less entertaining, it would still be a calling card for Juri's star-is-born performance. The beguiled viewer watches her and thinks, "Bingo!"__An absurdly simplistic family drama; the movie's apparent audacity isn't even skin deep.__Crass, vulgar, and brilliant.__Wetlands is one of the most daring, visually arresting, innovative, and imaginative examples of filmmaking to come out of Europe in recent memory.__Its nastiness sings, instead of stings.__Graphic, occasionally disgusting but sweet-natured and liberated.__It isn't terribly clear where the movie - or its hedonistic heroine - is going, but getting there is one wild ride.__Women deserve their own gross-out movies, and, in Wetlands, the punk force is strong.__With her dirty-blond curls and angelic smile, Helen is fully alive in a way that's all too rare on our movie screens. She's not out to shock or sicken; that's your problem, not hers.__Wetlands is here to freak out the prudes and make "dirty" fun again. That it does. You won't find a better movie anywhere that features a teen girl using her crotch to wipe a public toilet seat.__Wetlands is wonderfully filthy and wildly perverse, occasionally funny, and even a little sad.__Take note, Lars von Trier: This is how you do a truly funny, subversive movie about a woman's obsession with the human body and sex.__Dank with the effluvia of a proudly unhygienic, sex-obsessed German teen, this frenetic adaptation of Charlotte Roche's notorious 2008 best-seller is a standing dare to anyone who thinks the movies have gotten too tame.__An accessible, stylish and ultimately even sweet film.__Wetlands might have landed with the thud of empty shock value were Helen not such an innately engaging character, or Juri so commanding in the role.__A captivating go-for-broke lead turn by Juri lends the film a poignancy to help offset the juvenile shock-tactic impulses.__A visually playful story of a girl finding herself from the inside out.__None__None
There are satisfying echoes of Stephen King's sly black humour in this deliciously nasty comedy thriller.__Screenwriters David Chirchirillo and Trent Haaga pose a simple question -- how much will a person degrade himself to make ends meet? -- but it's a potent one, at least for those of us who ponder it every Monday through Friday.__Let's just say it takes a dim view of human nature that seems well supported by the evidence, and that if you have an appetite for fatalistic, dirty-minded gore you won't be disappointed.__If Cheap Thrills ultimately does carry us along, it's due largely to Healy's performance and presence.__You should watch it as a twisted comedy. Those who do will be rewarded, especially by the film's outlandish final image.__To describe them would diminish their impact, but there are several occasions where it is tough to keep looking at the screen. Yet, thanks to the characters and their portrayals, you can't really look away, either.__A committed cast elevates what is, ultimately, a gimmicky thriller. It dissolves into a puddle of blood-tinged hypocrisy.__A fair amount of twisted fun, thanks mostly to a surprisingly, effectively low-key turn by Koechner as the game's emcee.__This is not a movie for everybody, but that assessment is not exactly intended as a thumbs down. Alarming thrills are guaranteed.__Cheap Thrills is little more than low-budget torture porn for the doobie-addled dudebro contingent.__The simple, even sometimes simplistic script is helped a lot by its cast.__By the end, Cheap Thrills too closely resembles the behavior it depicts.__[A] shock-value thriller.__If the way things wind up for Craig and Vince is perhaps inevitable, how they get there is not. As for the movie's audacious final shot, it's nothing short of iconic.__Dark, deeply disturbing and occasionally comic, Cheap Thrills puts a contemporary spin on the cinematic version of dare, pitting a mysterious guy with a wad of cash against a financially desperate pair of blue collars.__Cynical, amoral, tense and superbly shot and performed.__One of the most involving works of cinematic misanthropy in years.__Cheap Thrills is a thoroughly nasty piece of work, which doubtless will be the strongest selling point for this worst-case scenario about steadily escalating dares and degradations.__None__None
This isn't as hateful as, say, The Other Woman. The concept's a little higher and the humiliation more cosmic.__An unintended nightmare scenario for women in Hollywood, and the persistent humiliation required just to get noticed.__There's not much else we can praise about it, but at least "Walk of Shame" is perfectly titled.__A beautiful woman leaves a bar and goes home with James Marsden. And that is just about the only thing that makes sense in "Walk of Shame."__Not even the fleet comic footwork of Elizabeth Banks can save this vile, unfunny stab at screwball farce.__Though replete with plot holes and lapses in logic as wide and ugly as the L.A. Freeway, Walk of Shame doesn't have the moxie to go anywhere ludicrous or dangerous with its premise.__It would all be galling if it weren't so lame. But Walk of Shame is notable only for turning the unendingly adorable Banks into an unlikable figure.__If anyone walks away unblemished from Walk of Shame, it's Banks, who throws herself into every bit of physical comedy and humiliation the movie sends her way.__A solid vehicle for Elizabeth Banks to show off her comedic chops__Banks delivers an amusing slapstick turn in this otherwise strained, formulaic comedy.__Feels like the Hollywood equivalent of a joke about the boss' golf game at a company Christmas party.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Rudderless is humane and almost entertaining.__The film is a roller-coaster of emotions and the jolt, when it comes, will send you reeling.__For all its noble intentions and loaded emotions, "Rudderless" proves a largely hollow, uninvolving affair.__The story takes an even sharper left turn in the last half hour, raising emotional issues it can't adequately address.__"Rudderless" isn't always smoothly paced, and features a plot twist that's awkwardly handled, but at its heart is a performance that resonates - and a director that, I hope, has more stories to tell.__Dishonest, manipulative and ultimately infuriating ...__"Rudderless" is a quietly ambitious film, and if it eventually collapses under the dramatic weight it's asked to shoulder - and it does - at least it's trying.__"Rudderless" is a competent, well-acted melodrama, yet in scope and ambition it has the modest and serviceable scale of the small, not silver, screen.__It's not easy making an uplifting film about the aftermath of the death of a son. But director and co-writer William H. Macy and actor Billy Crudup as the bereaved father pull it off in "Rudderless," a movie more about redemption than the causes of evil.__Crudup's performance holds the center.

So consider this a warmup.__It's puzzling why a talent like Macy bothered with a project that is so long on sentiment and short on comic relief - and unclear on what it wants to say on a variety of hot-button topics.__A kind of unholy mash-up of Lynne Ramsay's sobering school-massacre melodrama We Need to Talk About Kevin with John Carney's bogus feel-good musical Begin Again.__A sober but not at all humorless film in which sentimentality is viewed as suspect, something to be indulged, if at all, in secrecy.__Somewhat baffling in retrospect, if actually rather bland and formulaic to watch.__None__None__None__None
What Marina sees in Borgman is one of the countless implausibilities that make the film more annoying than disturbing.__The black humour and perversity can occasionally startle, but the film takes far too much sadistic delight in punishing these entitled dopes.__A creepily comical story about an insistent vagrant turned insidious home occupier.__It's the hypnotic little thriller's disturbing twists that make it such a singular -- and singularly weird -- experience.__Though it's too enigmatic for its own good and often feels like it's being made up as it goes, the Dutch import "Borgman" holds interest if only to see what might possibly happen next.__"Borgman" might sound compelling in the abstract. But if you want to enjoy it and stay engaged by it for more than 10 minutes, you'll have to talk yourself into it.__Filled with surreal touches and shocking scenes of black humor, Borgman steams ahead with the power and inevitability of a nightmare.__[An] exceptionally disturbing film ...__You may find yourself chuckling at Borgman as much as you recoil at it. It's destined for cult status.__The story's magic is black, its perfidy driven by evil spirits.__With so many outre elements and so few concrete answers, Borgman certainly has the makings of a cult film, which seems very much by design. Too much by design, arguably ...__A sickening horror parable disguised as a comedy of mores, the Netherlands' "Borgman" is a rarity: a genuinely shocking, upsetting movie.__The picture is fascinating for the way it introduces the kernel of an idea and then builds on it slowly, sustaining suspense rather than just leading the audience right up to the "OK, I get it" moment and running out of steam.__In an era where there are very few truly surprising films, Borgman is one of the rare movies that manages to find something entirely new to say, with original, oddly drawn characters.__While the film ultimately is not as satisfying as it promises to be for much of the duration, it remains bracingly creepy and off-kilter.__For those who get on its wavelength, the rewards are ample and the desire to re-watch will take over.__A loopy, lopsided experiment__Provides a wonderful sense of unease as to who deserves our sympathy.__A sly, insidious and intermittently hilarious domestic thriller that is likely to remain one of the most daring selections of this year's Cannes competish.__None

Directors Nana Ekvtimshvili and Simon Gross adopt the long, contemplative takes of the new wave; much of the film feels familiar, but the location shooting and period details are nicely drawn, a result of Ekvtimshvili's autobiographical script.__The viewer becomes keenly aware that she is only getting part of the story.

What takes longer to recognize is the title's bitter irony.__First-time writer-director revisits her bittersweet Tblisi childhood.__An absorbing, intelligently assembled coming-of-ager that revolves around two pubescent gal-pals growing up in 1992, just after independence was restored.__Keenly observed, geographically specific portraits of adolescence are always welcome, but there's definitely something to be said for charging the genre's usual tender lyricism with an ever-present threat of life-altering violence.__Girls become women as the nation of Georgia awkwardly tries on its own independence in this sluggish period piece, set in post-Soviet 1992 and alternating earnest emotions and a stunted plot.__The site of the action, the pummeled landscape of revolution and war, isn't incidental -- it's what their generation has inherited, alongside disorder and dissent.
Despair is not quiet for a broken father (Aaron Paul) and his troublemaker sons in Kat Candler's brisk, transfixing drama, which takes place in blue-collar southeast Texas.__"Hellion" pads its slender, commonplace, but potentially rewarding premise with contrivances, cliches, repetitiousness, and, when all else fails, implausible, arbitrary melodrama.__Wiggins gives the boy's struggles a raw realism, but it's not enough to shore up this slackly paced slice of sunbaked Texas miserabilism.__Not that inarticulate characters can't be compelling if they are written with subtlety, acted with insight and, most of all, framed by a directorial vision, but "Hellion," despite a promising debut from Wiggins, falls short in at least two of the above.__The acting overall is strong, but Paul, still testing the waters after "Breaking Bad," is extraordinarily controlled.__The hellion of "Hellion" is Jacob Wilson, a 13-year-old Texas rebel with a cause. As played by a real teenager, Josh Wiggins, he's a force of nature.__Though it may seem as if it's heading in the direction of being a feel-good movie Hellion doesn't go down that predictable road. It is more authentic than that, and that is indeed something to feel good about.__If only Candler had trusted her characters enough to carry the story without the need for the requisite Act One gun and Act Three firing of same, Hellion would stand out more amidst an ever-growing pack of similar films.__"Hellion" offers a startling and memorable portrait of adolescent life in downscale East Texas suburbia, along with a white-hot breakthrough performance from teenage actor Josh Wiggins.__The whole film seems to be running in place.__Candler insistently tightens her focus on the hardships of growing up in a broken family, an approach that eventually feels over-determined.__Though some characters go underdeveloped, Hellion marks one of Hollywood's most realistic examinations of rural high school angst since Friday Night Lights, another teen drama set in Texas.__A glimpse into rural American childhood that's both tense and melancholy.__The movie falls into an all too familiar indie torpor.__Features a fair share of forced drama ...__Hellion offers Paul his most adult screen role so far, and he's very fine, but the movie belongs to Wiggins, a newcomer whose innate gifts are a perfect echo of Paul's.__Texas-based helmer Kat Candler unpacks the inner turmoil behind acts of trespassing, vandalism and spontaneous aggression that threaten to send young Jacob down the wrong path in life.__While the film is absorbing and not without pathos, there's insufficient insight or shape to the screenplay, which drifts between Hollis and Jacob without building momentum.__None__None
Director David Mackenzie has empathy for the characters, but also knows how to ratchet up the tension and make the scene of mayhem pack a wallop.__[An] unusually cohesive and exciting prison drama ...__"Starred Up" manages to be sympathetic, not only because of O'Connell's galvanizing turn, but also Asser and director David Mackenzie's unwavering commitment to portraying his character with as much compassion as brutal honesty.__It's almost as difficult to sit through "Starred Up" as it is satisfying to watch it.__The British prison movie Starred Up has the excitement of a nonstop psychological cage fight, but its goal is enlightenment, not terror or cheap thrills.__It marries ferocious, unnerving violence and waves of profanity to powerful, psychologically acute performances in a way that is intensely dramatic as well as almost unbearable to watch at times.__The raw emotions on display need no translation. David Mackenzie directs the film in a piercingly realistic style.__This is strong medicine, yet it's also exhilarating.__Starred Up is an edgy, teeming thriller, brilliantly disorienting, making strange a world we thought we knew, at least from other movies.__Audiences, the less squeamish at least, will benefit from Mr. Mackenzie's ability to wring white-knuckling tension out of Mr. Asser's intelligent story.__Expect to hear a lot more from English actor Jack O'Connell, who holds the screen as well as his character, Eric, commands a cellblock.__Starred Up has three powerful advantages: a realistic setting, fierce performances and the insight brought by scripter Jonathan Asser, who was an Oliver-like counselor in a tough London jail.__Starred Up is a small indie film in danger of slipping through the cracks at the Hollywood-driven multiplex. Finding it - in theaters or on VOD - is well worth the effort.__O'Connell bristles with terrifying hair-trigger unpredictability. Watching him, you feel like you're witnessing the arrival of a new movie star.__What the movie excels at, among other things, is putting the viewer into the prison life mindset, laying dramatic groundwork that allows the audience to intuit when an unspoken rule-like crossing the prison's strict racial boundaries-has been broken.__As harrowing as some of the depicted incidents are - this is prison, after all - Mackenzie resists sensationalism, preferring to keep his sights on the human element. By the end, he's worked a kind of alchemy.__Turns the complicated dynamic between a young prisoner and his problematic mentor into a ferocious psychodrama that locks you in and refuses to let you go.__Mackenzie isn't attempting to craft a larger-than-life antihero here, but delving into the sociology of this hellish subculture, where prisoners and staff alike coexist in this dehumanizing environment.__Young actor Jack O'Connell is the main attraction in this tough British drama.__For the most part this is furiously compelling stuff, convincingly mounted and superbly acted
Biyi Bandele has excerpted their story from a much wider-ranging narrative, but the action here is still so tightly compressed that this feels like a precis for a movie twice its length.__The best of the movie finds a way to abridge the novel and still allow the scenes to breathe.__Like many a lengthy novel, it might have worked better as a television series.__"Half of a Yellow Sun" winds up being one of those movies in which a pesky event of great historical import keeps getting in the way of a soap-opera romance.__The result is that melodramatic soap opera elements win out over Bandele's attempts at stirring historical drama. That said, it's still a story worth telling.__"Half of a Yellow Sun" deals with human tragedy, but it never really makes a human connection.__It's just not stirring enough as historical drama.__Transporting, well acted, and occasionally powerful. It's also a rushed, maddening mess.__A well-acted, finely wrought epic that nevertheless struggles to balance the requirements of melodrama with its drive to capture a historical moment.__Disappointing, a romance pastiche that muddles the politics of the period beyond comprehension.__Half of a Yellow Sun strikes an admirable balance between drama and history.__This well-acted adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's award-winning novel starts like a college soap opera, before turning into a Nigerian Gone with the Wind.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Somewhere over the rainbow the skies are blue, that's the dream. Some make it, some don't - this eloquent daughter's tale shows both sides.__Gets stuck in a cycle of addiction and morning-after regret while missing a chance to explore the how and why of its characters.__"Low Down" nicely evokes a smokey mood of '50s jazz and Hollywood noir and deserves points for its emotional straightforwardness, but its tired story and deliberate pace never really draw you in.__Whiplash is like one of those Buddy Rich solos the kid idolizes: hot, sweaty and in-your-face. Low Down is like the version of Billy Strayhorn's Lush Life played in one of this film's club scenes: somber, moody and cool to the touch.__The acting makes it a far more compelling ride than it otherwise would have been.__Fanning's performance rescues the film from mediocrity.__It is both stunningly somber and breathtakingly well-crafted, a pure and gripping cinematic love song in a melancholy key.__Low Down is rich in vivid characters.__Glenn Close plays Amy-Jo's grandmother, a nurturing figure in a dingy milieu, and delivers one of her better recent performances, while Hawkes, who bears a striking resemblance to Albany, again proves he's among our most dependable actors.__The squalor alone isn't enough - this would be a more affecting story had if it showed us what was happening beneath the decaying exterior.__"Low Down" serves as a terrific example of how to evoke a given period on a tight budget.__A lovely film that brings great emotion and a dead-on feeling for time, place and recaptured mood to a story that is as universal as it is personal.__This movie from Jeff Preiss is a stream of recollections, but the late-afternoon-light grain of its Super 16-millimeter camerawork and the gestures of warmth between its characters perhaps say more than any rise-and-fall might.__Low Down is a knockout, a candid picture of much of jazz, and one more step for a master actor.__Preiss soaks his movie in a brownish retro atmosphere, which helps smooth over the many dull spots, but only briefly.__Low Down keeps the histrionics to a minimum, but the inertia of a good man failing to be a good father isn't enough to sustain nearly two hours of reflection ...__"Low Down" painstakingly re-creates the look and sound of the gritty life of jazz pianist and heroin addict Joe Albany in the 1960s and '70s, but can't find its rhythm.__The story is familiar, the screenplay never explains the demons that drove Joe Albany to trash his talent, and the life of a reckless junkie eventually grows tedious.__Fanning manages to bring soulfulness to a character who mostly reacts to others; you just wish the whole movie were, well, jazzier.__There are too many notes that, while not false, are neither satisfactorily resolved nor left interestingly unresolved.
Wiig's underplaying, a repressed otherworldly Sissy Spacek sort of thing, has its moments of humor, but this proud, simple woman is never for an instant comic.__It doesn't take long for us to get lost in Wiig's thorough portrayal of a dowdy housekeeper who must soldier on in the face of a cruel prank to find some kind of love in her life.__Liza Johnson's nicely tuned, and turned, adaptation of the Alice Munro short story "Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage."__We've never seen a protagonist quite like Johanna, who on the one hand personifies female self-abnegation at its most domesticated, but on the other embodies the sheer will at its most stubborn.__Short fiction can be a marvelous blueprint for film and revisiting Nobel Prize-winner Munro's story in this era of "catfishing" makes a lot of sense: People are no less desperate for connection than they ever have been.__The buttoned-up, buttoned-lipped Wiig seems to have landed in the Midwest from Mars, as though, like David Bowie before her, she's The Maid Who Fell to Earth__"Kristen Wiig's performance in "Hateship Loveship" is so beautifully muted it takes a while to appreciate the loveliness of the notes she's hitting."__Rather than sifting through the emotional layers of a surprisingly determined young woman, more often the scenes feel drained of life.__The people on screen are all worth watching, as is Johnson's directorial career.__This jumbled drama gets decent mileage out of actress Kristen Wiig but is hindered by a subpar script that fails to translate Munro's characterizations and intricate plotting to the screen.__What's supposed to be guileless and unformed starts to feel like shtick.__This is a movie in which our worst pulp expectations are constantly being upended.__When a script can't give even a drugged-out Jennifer Jason Leigh a tasty scene to chew on, it's playing just a little too nice.__It's amazing how much this film does accomplish, given its modesty of both means and scale.__I hope this is Wiig's last sad-sack turn; it seems a waste to ignore those comic chops in the pursuit of this sort of Serious Acting.__Too bad "blahship" isn't an option. Because that sums it up.__An absorbing, messy, modest story of damaged relationships.__A preposterous wish-fulfillment fantasy with an enormous void at its center.__Kristin Wiig's turn as a dowdy caretaker is the highlight of this contemporary American take on Cinderella.__Liza Johnson makes fine, steady progress with this delicate and absorbing character study starring Kristen Wiig.
This potent Norwegian drama by Erik Poppe, himself a veteran war photographer, opens with a gripping sequence.__The whole cast is good, but as always, all roads lead to Binoche, who is wonderful.__Poppe can't match the stunning opener of Binoche photographing a suicide bomber in Kabul with scenes of domesticity. But Binoche never falters. She's the film's fire and grieving heart.__Poppe crafts some powerful scenes that pose questions not easily answered.__What makes "1,000 Times Good Night" more than a dramatic essay on wartime journalism is Ms. Binoche's wrenchingly honest portrayal ...__"1,000 Times Good Night" has moments of both startling violence and breathtaking beauty.__Moving from sophisticated character close-ups, to dreamlike fantasy, to exciting coverage of the photographer's shattering battle experience, the movie is austerely elegant.__Sadly, this gorgeous-looking adult movie plays out the same theme over and over, never going anywhere surprising.__"1,000 Times Good Night" takes its time, letting the pathos fully soak in. Those who are regulars at film festivals will find the pacing - and the emotional note it ends on - very familiar.__A disappointingly standard-issue addiction melodrama, this one the tearful case study of an adrenaline junkie whose compulsion threatens to push her family and loved ones away.__A self-important art-house film by an ex- war photographer who lacks distance from his subject.__Poppe's closeness to the material ensures a level of passion, but he still fails to create a truly specific dynamic for Rebecca and Marcus's family ...__An affecting drama made more poignant by honest-feeling autobiographical elements, Erik Poppe's A Thousand Times Goodnight examines the choice between family and career when that career represents work of real social importance.__Deftly sidestepping both melodrama and family-values messaging, Poppe imbues the film with enormous emotional resonance, brilliantly grounded by his leading lady.__It's as handsomely shot as any film about an ace shutterbug ought to be, and Juliette Binoche infuses familiar internal crises with palpable pain and urgency.__None__None__None__None__None
Gives a hell of a first impression, but the deeper we delve into the screenplay, the more obvious it becomes that there's not much going on under the surface.__At Middleton is a modest movie with modest aims, but at times it feels like a small miracle.__Some truths about George and Edith's underlying emotional state come out in an unconventional and interesting way, but it's not enough to make us care about the attraction that is drawing them closer.__Both Garcia and Farmiga dive head-on into raging rapids of doubt, pain and recrimination.__None of this is particularly innovative, although Garcia and the elder Farmiga develop a nice spark and a gentle humor in their characters' stolen day together.__A bittersweet portrait of two people, who, in the process of helping their children choose a college, confront the emptiness of their respective marriages.__The actors push too hard to flesh out this whimsical, cliched blend of campus comedy and midlife rom-com.__Pity. A different film might have made better use of Farmiga's breezy warmth and Garcia's velvety charm.__Garcia and Farmiga have such an easy, natural chemistry that their on-screen sparkle helps mitigate the film's weaknesses. At others times, it serves to underscore what might have been. It's a feckless conundrum.__As pleasing as it is to watch these actors at work, they aren't able to elevate the lightweight script behind this classic stolen-moments romance that seems more suited to TV than the big screen.__Though it's fun to watch Garcia let out his inner goofball, the jewels in the crown of At Middleton are the dynamic sisters Farmiga.__It's a lovely film that grows along with the characters. At first, it seems like a pleasing but inconsequential comedy. But it deepens as their connection deepens and opens up into a place of poignancy and insight.__An almost completely inauthentic little romance that is so genuinely pleasant you'll enjoy it anyway.__"At Middleton" is formulaic and contrived. It's also worth seeing because it breathes a little, and because Vera Farmiga and Andy Garcia know what they're doing as they guide this appealingly simple brief encounter of a romance.__Often plays like a forgotten trifle from the Golden Age of Hollywood studio filmmaking, distinguished more by its competence and affable performances than by any formal or thematic potency.__The movie loses some of its focus and turns both silly and implausible. Still, the stars' chemistry works, and so does At Middleton.__Modern-day Brief Encounter benefits from sparkling dialogue and splendid acting.__What starts out mildly charming is mostly tiresome by the time they start doing bong rips in a random student's dorm room.__None__None
The stakes are low throughout the film - even the bullies are mostly bluster - making the big finish an anticlimax.__[Tully achieves] a winning innocence of spirit in which performances and production design are all perfectly synched to his low-key comic vision.__It's so dedicated to the odd textures of its world that it becomes something else - personal, abstract, and strangely honest.__A ho-hum memory piece that could have used a bit more objectivity, not to mention depth and energy.__This gentle comedy, while entirely unmemorable, releases a genuine warmth that deflects harsh judgment.__"Ping Pong Summer" may not be an instant classic, but it knows its time and place. There's a humble honor in that.__A friendly puppy of a movie. It's clumsy and bumbling but disarmingly sweet in spirit.__A sometimes-intriguing experiment in upended expectations, though not a particularly successful one.__This sweet, offhanded but lovingly observed remembrance is a real kick.__Michael Tully's mild tribute to the 1980s - the decade that just won't go away.__There are retro touches that children of the '80s will smile at (remember smelling the liner notes of cassettes?). But ultimately, those are too few and far between.__It plays like a cherished memory, rosy and warm, rebuilt in miniature with such affection and detail it's hard not to be moved by its sincerity.__A fun-but-slight coming-of-age story about an awkward Maryland teenager who becomes, well, not a man exactly, but a slightly more comfortable teenager, on a family vacation during the magical summer of 1985.__Tully seems filled with yearning for the happy side to the story and dwells fleetingly on his hero's struggles and humiliations; neither the problems nor their resolutions have any weight.__Ninety minutes of vapid 80s fetishism packaged to resemble a proper feature film, a memory-baiting time-sink for twenty-somethings eager to mainline nostalgia at length.__Rose-tinted as the film's perspective may be, Ping Pong Summer is still a lingering, entertaining glance back at an era that Americans just can't seem to get enough of, whether in music or movies.__None__None__None__None
To Be Takei is a celebration of a man of great resilience, infectious humor, a voracious appetite for the richness of the human experience, and the best laugh in the history of laughing.__While there's pathos and tragedy here, there's also good humor and human strength.__This is a film blessed with excellent footage and plenty of nice moments.__Another pleasant if disposable portrait.__This could have easily been a platitudinous, self-important mess, but Kroot does a couple of very savvy things here.__What made and makes Takei a powerful spokesman is obvious in the film.__Chats with "Trek" cast members and other Takei friends and supporters, plus a wealth of family and archival photos and footage, complete this lively tribute.__Much more than a "Star Trek" footnote or a standard coming-out story.__[Ms. Kroot's] banalizing documentary is self-defeating ...__The energetic and upbeat actor is also a same-sex marriage activist and social media superstar. But the outgoing man we meet onscreen also has a quieter side.__Like its subject, "To Be Takei" is very likable.__Director Jennifer Kroot's good-natured biography is so appealing that even non-Trekkies may be convinced we needed a full-length documentary about the man who was Sulu.__Takei alternates among admirable but uninspiring lecturing, the usual un-insightfully laudatory talking heads, and the dullest parts of the actor's days.__The doc works best as a relationship study, filled with endearing moments of intimate bickering.__If witnessing Takei and Brad exchanging vows doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you're either heartless, or you're William Shatner.__A unique blend of camp and conviction, "To Be Takei" deftly showcases George Takei's eclectic personality and wildly disparate achievements, from "Star Trek" crewmate to gay-rights activist.__None__None__None__None
Panh fulfills his debts to the dead not just by adding to the visual record of genocide, but also by creating a transcendent work of art.__In narration that is poetic and historically astute, Panh layers his own memoir atop his nation's.__Many films have examined from many vantages the Khmer Rouge's nightmare reign, notably Roland Joffe's 1985 Oscar winner The Killing Fields.__As haunting as it is haunted, "The Missing Picture" leaves viewers' heads rattling with ghosts.__A uniquely subjective account of the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s, "The Missing Picture" is the work of Rithy Panh, a Cambodian native who left his homeland when he was an adolescent.__[It] aspires to a poetry about barbarism that will not let us forget.__The film captures how Pol Pot took Mao's Great Leap Forward to new levels of Marxist madness.__Panh uses the props and eerie clips from Khmer Rouge propaganda newsreels to tell about his family, and his country. Along with starkly poetic narration, read by Randal Douc, the effect is devastating, without a single scene of actual bloodshed.__These miniatures magnify their subjects, and ennoble them. The picture is anguishing to see, but it isn't missing anymore.__Panh believes that those who survive such oppression are obligated to speak about it - and this chronicle is impossible not to watch.__This is a first-person account of astonishing suffering, yet the experience of watching "The Missing Picture" is not punishing.__Panh blends documentary, personal memoir and eccentric artistic experiment ...__As an examination of memory and experience and how they shape us, "The Missing Picture" is meaningful beyond its specific subject matter.__The audacity of "The Missing Picture" - a brilliant documentary about a child who held on to life in Cambodia's killing fields - is equaled only by its soulfulness.__The Missing Picture is so immediate, so vital, it practically breathes. Not all memoirs need to exist. But the gentle urgency of Panh's story is right there in the filmmaking.__The conceit is tremendously daring, but one with a huge payoff, suggesting an evil that can't be fully processed by young eyes.__Panh honors the Khmer Rouge's victims while staging the agony and responsibility of memory itself.__With sober eloquence, the filmmaker lays out the arrival of the Khmer Rouge, the philosophy used to justify their crimes, and the slow slipping away of his family, each member claimed by this horrible social experiment.__I could say the movie requires some patience, but in fact it commands patience with its humbling tale of a boy being cruelly torn from one life and forced into another one of extreme privation.__The film is a brave act of witness complicated by the documaker's decision to re-create his experiences using clay figurines, a tricky aesthetic device that raises fascinating and problematic questions of representation.
The Retrieval's potency transcends its scope. It shows you, in microcosm, the sacrifices that forge the conscience not only of a boy, but of a nation.__"The Retrieval" comes at you like a haunting slip of a memory, one that writer-director Chris Eska retrieves from a mostly forgotten era in unforgettable ways.__It is indeed a beautiful film, but with each horizon tinged with sadness. If it was an Instagram filter, it would probably be called melancholy or something.__The movie's flaws are not missteps, but steps not taken.__Low-budget period indies rarely inhabit their world as convincingly as does this drama, which is set in the South in 1864.__A tough, tender little movie, "The Retrieval" tells a story of divided souls wandering a divided land.__Eska provides ample space for his principals to breathe, wisely homing in on the uneasy gaze of the guidance-starved Will, whose struggle will resonate with anyone charged with an unenviable task.__Equal parts suspenseful road movie, persuasively detailed period drama and emotionally resonant coming-of-age story, The Retrieval is an outstanding example of regional indie filmmaking accomplished with limited resources and an abundance of skill.__A skillfully wrought feature with appreciable emotional and historical resonance.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

More play, less luvvies please.__There is nothing that drives this film except a tone of inward-gazing self-importance, sweetened by the sentimental bonding of the play's cast and crew and Whelehan's touristy location shots.__It's that rare film that captures and conveys the romance of the theatrical experience.__The camaraderie among the players, some of whom have interesting stories of their own, tends to shut out any sense of audience response, aside from the ovation that reliably greets the star as soon as he appears onstage.__Over the course of the film, a sense of the cast's camaraderie comes through, the almost family feeling that takes over among people thrown together in such intimate circumstances.__Spacey serves as an engaging, amiable host but also offers spot-on observations about the demanding role.__"NOW," in the end, celebrates a warm and particular type of family values.__The film serves an effective marketing tool after all, with some lively footage and funny interviews.

Decoding Annie Parker is a movie about resilience, about staring doom straight in the face - with a smile, with hope.__This modest indie with major ambitions is directed by veteran cinematographer Steven Bernstein, making a solid feature debut.__Tears are shed in "Decoding Annie Parker," but they aren't accompanied by the kind of sad, misty soundtrack music that can leave you feeling used and abused. Instead of jerking tears, the movie edifies.__"Decoding Annie Parker," though uneven in its execution, has at its heart two remarkable women and one remarkable performance.__It sticks mostly to one track, taking audience members on a journey that, sadly, via the movies or their own lives, they already may know a little too well.__The film features a wonderfully nuanced performance from Samantha Morton as Annie.__Decoding Annie Parker is a better living-with-disease drama than medical mystery.__[A] well-intentioned, if ultimately underwhelming, ode to the ongoing fight for a cure.__A multi-decade drama painted in the broadest strokes possible.__Hunt and Morton don't appear onscreen together until the end of the movie, which makes this feel like two projects forced to mingle.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
There is muscle and volume in the performances; but had Demme hung back, and kept things cooler and quieter, the mastery of what Ibsen built, and the agon of his extraordinary hero, would have cast a more looming shadow.__For a movie that lasts longer than two hours and is made up solely of talking, it's impressive that the story never seems to drag.__Though the film makes little effort to open up the play, letting it all unfold, as in the original, within Solness's house - if not his mind - Demme's version intensifies the drama into something oneiric.__Surprisingly engaging ...__A film that plays not as a theatrical antique, but as a crackling, profound entry in The Twilight Zone.__Shawn veers away from his usual nebbishy persona here and skillfully suggests a master manipulator and shrewdly controlling womanizer driven by insecurities and guilt.__It doesn't attain the highs of Shawn and Gregory's My Dinner With Andre, but the movie has a jittery intimacy that is appealing.__A Master Builder really doesn't work, hampered by odd casting, theatrical performances and a reductive interpretation of Ibsen's play.__The oddly unheroic Shawn is somehow perfect as Solness, a flawed contemporary man who feels his genius entitles him to run roughshod over those he loves as well as those he works with.__Mumblecore is not a good look for Ibsen.__The film will serve as a solid introduction to the play for those unfamiliar with it.__A modestly scaled but potent film version of the adaptation, which hews closely to Ibsen's original - except when it doesn't.__There's an overall lifelessness to A Master Builder, as if Demme were embalming the Shawn-Gregory stage show rather than making it live onscreen.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
If you want to provoke an artist, try to stifle him.__Ai granted Johnsen significant access to his personal and professional lives following his release, including his tender interactions with his young son, and the film's intimate nature recalls the verite style of Ai's own video work.__Remarkably intimate and astute.__Although expertly edited, Johnsen's film, whose soundtrack ends with Nina Simone's "Feeling Good," presents a less effective portrait of Ai than Klayman's does.__The film quietly and slowly reveals a man struggling internally to find the right response to the restrictions imposed on him and determining that to stop speaking out would itself be a kind of death.__Johnsen intimately chronicles the fascinating push-pull of Ai's daily existence: the man he truly is now contrasted with the man he hopes to become once again.__"If I don't share my voice," he says, "then I am dead already."

An inspiring, educational, highly enjoyable documentary from director Patrick Creadon, best known for 2008's I.O.U.S.A., which chronicled America's less-than-healthy fiscal condition.__The film is about innovation inside and outside the classroom and the transformative power of good teaching.__[Creadon] probably errs on the side of advocacy here.

The best one can say for this troubling, if intermittently fascinating, mess is that it succeeds in raising questions, moral as well as aesthetic, that it cannot answer.__Murmelstein addresses Lanzmann's skepticism and questions with earnestness, passion and -- as if the rest of it wasn't troubling enough -- what seems like total recall.__Lanzmann organizes the material achronologically, presenting Murmelstein's narrative out of order and intercutting it with footage of Theresienstadt shot in 2012; this complex structure evokes a sense of moral vertigo that's nearly impossible to shake.__Those who think this is a black-and-white issue will be surprised, as Lanzmann himself appears to have been, by what is said here.__The Last of the Unjust has a vivid immediacy.__[Lanzmann is] the kind of witness the Holocaust needs: The witness who refuses to leave the stand until the full story is told.__The new film may not qualify for masterpiece status, but it's an enthralling portrait of a man-an exceptionally brilliant and articulate man-who personified the courage, complexity and moral ambiguity of his tortured time.__Murmelstein deserves his own movie and now, more than 20 years after his death, he gets it.__A startling double portrait of the will to endure.__A powerful reflection on the beginning of Hitler's Final Solution is seen through the intelligent, sardonic eyes of an aged eyewitness.__Another demanding and deeply rewarding investigation into the Holocaust from documentarian Claude Lanzmann.__[Lanzmann's] documentary doesn't deserve an audience so much as demand one.__It is a fascinating story, and although one told before - the 2003 documentary "Prisoner of Paradise" also touched on this "model" ghetto - Murmelstein has a wealth of detail at his fingers, particularly the vicious lies the Nazis themselves told.__At three hours and 38 minutes, "The Last of the Unjust," like Lanzmann himself at his advanced age, is ungainly but powerful.__The portrait of an individual whose actions still defy comprehension, and the self-portrait of an artist consumed by the past.__Short, squat and vibrantly pugnacious, Murmelstein at age 70 is a dazzling raconteur, more than ready for his close-up and ravenous for the chance to make his case.__To some extent the film is a thundering riposte to Hannah Arendt's "Eichmann in Jerusalem."__The Last Of The Unjust is demanding but fascinating, both as history and as an intellectual volley ...__Lanzmann's feisty exchanges with Murmelstein, a brilliant talker, become an emotional symbol for the pursuit of slippery truth, while the filmmaker's recently shot footage of Yom Kippur services show a way of life in robust continuation.__As Murmelstein talks, we begin to see the world through his eyes.

Beautifully shot, well acted, and the score is lovely, but the film has nothing to say about the human degradation in which it wallows.

There's simply not enough insight here to make the punishment worthwhile.__Child Of God is a lurid backwoods exploitation cheapie that just happens to be based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy.__"Child of God'' is, like the source novel, loosely inspired by the notorious real-life cannibal murderer Ed Gein. So was Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho.'' Nobody left that classic bored - but they sure will be by Franco's film.__Franco is determined to humanize Ballard in a misguided quest to make him likable, as if likability were a conduit to credibility and not just a pandering to audience members.__[Franco] should get credit for ... possessing the willpower to make a movie that virtually no one is going to see.__What did we do to deserve James Franco?__It could have been so much worse; we wish it was a lot better.__Child of God is brazenly, outstandingly bad, as vague, pretentious, and pointless as its sorry title.__So, did all that industry pay off?

For adults, it may take you back to a time when crayons were king.__This is a pretty lame computer-generated animated movie that will likely not engage kids much past the first grade.__Cheerfully exhorting imagination, creativity and bravery in children while demonstrating none of those virtues itself, "The Hero of Color City" proves to be a dispiritingly colorless feature-length babysitter.__"The Hero of Color City" cannily distills the children's movie to its lowest common denominator: bright colors flashing on screen.__The problem, to paraphrase Samuel Johnson, is that most of what's good is not original, and most of what's original is not good.__The songs, like the script and the animation, are unmemorable.__For parents of very young children looking for a weekend distraction, "Color City" is passable fare - and will at least inspire kiddies to finish what they start, coloring-wise.__A perfectly pleasant pastiche of other movies, the most obvious antecedent being the Toy Story films.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
People are just like birds, this French drama asserts-over and over again, with mind-numbing obviousness, until you might feel like spreading your wings and flying away yourself.__An airport hotel may not seem the most inspiring of locations for a story of life-changing consequence, but French filmmaker Pascale Ferran's delicate, compassionate "Bird People" is just that sort of risk-taking existential adventure.__The vehicle for the message feels haphazard, as if Ferran were trying to create a patchwork of various film types rather than one cohesive piece.__Bird People has ideas about nature, human and otherwise. It's got a sense of romantic wonder.__An artful experiment that only half works.__Viewed from a certain angle, "Bird People" is a very sad movie. But it's also a lark.__The best moments in "Bird People" soar to such heights that you almost want to forgive the parts that amount to mere droppings.__A film that finds beauty and drama in the tiniest places.__Bird People finds new ways to anatomize 21st-century malaise.__It's deliciously risky, though Ferran falls far short of Icarus' folly, soaring low and returning to earth having risked too little.__Two lost souls flock together, sort of, in an ambitious French film that takes flight in some highly unusual ways.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"Abuse of Weakness" is 20 minutes of a great movie and another 85 minutes of nothing much.__With clinical dispassion and narrative elegance, Breillat has constructed what she calls "a thriller about denial."__The film's title refers to the French legal term for taking advantage of a person of diminished capacity. The story, though, suggests other interpretations.__As a portrait of what it's like to be suddenly helpless, Abuse Of Weakness is never less than fascinating ...__[A] chilly, dark portrait of two control freaks locking horns.__Breillat's self-conscious refusal to establish a realistic basis for this deeply mismatched relationship winds up weakening the film irreparably.__The plot, though never less than engaging, occasionally tests believability - until you remember it's drawn from Breillat's life.__Breillat's impressive film is a study of bodies and how we carry them, and it explores the manner in which weakness seeks out strength on an almost primal level, bypassing the higher modes of human thought.__The movie is interesting to think about as another of the Anatomy Of Hell director's power-struggle portraits, even if its conceit-by design-leaves the question of how the filmmaker allowed a known operator to bilk her out of so much money unresolved.__Like in all of the director's work, psychologically reductive readings of the characters are absent, though intriguing performances give audiences a way into the material.__Catherine Breillat's films have always been autobiographical, often painfully so, and yet "Abuse of Weakness" cuts even closer to the marrow than the rest.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The film is at its best when Vargas, like a good journalist, probes the subject of immigration and talks to people about their experiences and opinions.__As agenda-driven as "Documented" is, it also is a deeply engrossing self-portrait. If 11 million undocumented Americans are a statistic, one, if shown in the right light, is a tragedy.__His advocacy is meant to serve primarily him.__"Documented" is obviously a bit of advocacy filmmaking, which is fine, but most of the time it's not compelling enough to reach beyond the converted.__Mr. Vargas's apt formulations come to sound like sound bites. His strategy is political - in a meaningful way - but not cinematic.__The well-told story of Jose Antonio Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who outed himself as undocumented, a situation he finds terrifying and exhausting.__This is unmistakably the work of a journalist, unadorned and straightforward, with Vargas taking a direct and rational stance. But he's not averse to raising hell.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Swanberg's naturalistic, improvised style lets the conflict come about organically, repeatedly putting the characters in situations to which they could react with cliches but instead go with something more empathetic and nuanced.__This semi-improvised indie accomplishes its modest goal, which is to explore the way a vexing relationship between in-laws can yield unexpected personal growth and warm bonds of affection.__I suppose it's because his father in this movie is played by his father, but I've never seen a better performance -- or whatever you want to call it -- from a two-year-old.__The script doesn't just leave things unsaid but unnoticed, and the film's conclusion isn't much more than a half-hearted well, yeah, whatever.__A slightly above average example of a kind of movie - and of a trend within movies - that needs to be encouraged.__A quiet, serious comedy about marriage, parenthood and the everyday strains of bringing up a rambunctious toddler while struggling to sustain a creative life.__If the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decides to add an Oscar category called Best Performance by a Toddler in an Indie Film Directed by His Own Father, Jude Swanberg would easily smoke any precocious competition.__It's not always pretty, and it's not always exciting, but you genuinely don't know from one moment to the next how these characters will behave.__"Happy Christmas" is a lovely example of an undeniably valuable genre.__When a 2-year-old walks off with a film, it's a sign the adults could have used some higher stakes.__Mr. Swanberg is not a total amateur, but he is called "a doodler" for obvious reasons, all of them on red alert here.__Swanberg is good at futzing with our moment-to-moment expectations, but he can't shape all these well-acted scenes into a satisfying whole.__A subtle, witty, wise and deeply compassionate American movie.__The movie is packed with minor incidents, all fresh, compelling, and funny.__Happy Christmas is a jaunty domestic dramedy that covers some of the same territory as Neighbors under one roof, with characters who are smart, funny, endearing and unpredictable rather than boorish and silly.__Happy Christmas examines, in its shambling way, the challenges facing dual-career couples as they become parents.__All in all, "Happy Christmas" is a good deal like cartoon Charlie Brown's classic tree - scraggly, plenty of heart and much to enjoy, especially if you prefer your presents homemade.__A gently funny ensemble comedy that feels less like a movie than a short story.__Unfortunately, Happy Christmas's characters and conflicts are generic compared to Drinking Buddies.__"Happy Christmas" leans hard on the ensemble's exploratory attempts at ad hoc dialogue, so that you find yourself providing alternative snatches of banter in your head, just to speed things up a little.
Invited to sit in the facing seat, we have long minutes to watch, listen and assess, considering who these pilgrims are and what, aside from worship, has really brought them here.__"Manakamana" is simple in conception, but the reactions it evokes in viewers will be complex and multifaceted.__"Manakamana" is a haunting experience, one that requires patience (and then some) but that offers spiritual, philosophical, and aesthetic rewards beyond the immediate power of words to describe.__The directors, Pacho Velez (who did the camera work) and Stephanie Spray (who recorded the sound), condense world history into the confined space of a glassed-in bubble.__By focusing on such a narrow slice of Nepali life, Ms. Spray and Mr. Velez have ceded any totalizing claim on the truth and instead settled for a perfect incompleteness.__Manakamana doesn't answer any questions, yet makes its point: Nepal, like the rest of our planet, is a picturesque but far from peaceable kingdom.__As a theatrical experience, Manakamana is spellbinding.

Stations of the Elevated plays like a time capsule, particularly for having no dialogue or plot.

The Kafkaesque story itself proves more engaging while the narrative illusion is sustained than it does when Panahi's imposed, solipsistic self-regard shatters it.__It doesn't carry the impact of some of Panahi's more conventional films. It's not his best movie, but the fact that he's making a movie at all is remarkable.__Unfortunately, Closed Curtain also indicates there's only so much an artist can say about his own oppression before he winds up in a creative cul-de-sac.__Less satisfying than his previous pic, yet still a bold, melancholy statement.__A complex film-within-a-film structure uses the favorite techniques of reflexive Iranian cinema to assert the need to recount reality.__This is one of those layered, fairly plotless and enigmatic films that comes into sharper focus as it goes along.__"Closed Curtain" is richly allegorical, but the film succeeds even more as an exiled artist's reassurance that the law can't stamp out art.__Closed Curtain can be seen to express something more than the plight of one artist in internal exile. That house on the Caspian, a home that's also a prison, represents an entire country in spiritual incarceration.__If you're willing to roll with the tremendous loneliness, sadness and ambiguity of this tender parable about life and art in bizarrely constricted circumstances, it restores Jafar Panahi to us as something more than a noble sacrifice.__Pahani's films have become increasingly indistinguishable from his complex life, making them a challenging but often thrilling experience.__A spotty meta movie that might leave a viewer wishing Panahi could go back to making films that aren't about himself-which seems to be the point.__On one level, the film ... is a mischievous, Pirandellian entertainment. It is also an allegory, dark but not despairing, of the creative spirit under political pressure, and of the ways the imagination can be both a refuge and a place of confinement.__In a way, "Closed Curtain" is, of and by itself, precisely what Panahi is stubbornly insisting on - the right to make films the way he wants to make them and to say the things he wants to say, without any interference from anyone.__Throughout Closed Curtain there's the feeling that the film itself is unfinished - it is, in fact, unfinishable, because life does go on.__The journey is often challenging, but the rewards-heady, emotional, provocative and invigorating-are endless.__Imagination and reality flow together in surprising and exhilarating ways.__None__None__None__None
"The King and the Mockingbird" just might be the best animated film of the year.__An unforgettable story of love, loss and life's absurdities.__On a basic level, The King and the Mockingbird is a fun fantasy.

A more fitting title for the film would be "Limping."__If "Lilting" was a play, it would run for months.__It is, as the title suggests, sweet - but also slight.__Guilt hangs over "Lilting," a suffocating haze so thick that it permeates every unspoken, non-understood word between characters trying to traverse a frustrating gulf of language and grief.__Hong, who makes his feature debut here, has a masterful command of rhythm, beautifully weaving each strand of the narrative around that momentous opening scene.__Despite a strong start, the filmmaker doesn't exactly know where to go with it.

This tepid indie comedy lacks a consistent tone; directors Tom Dolby and Tom Williams can't decide whether to satirize or sympathize with their wealthy, self-regarding characters.__A flat drama filmed at a house that's more interesting than most of the characters.__The characters flutter about, argue and flirt, but they are simply too bland and vacuous to make much of an impression.__Clarkson embodies the longings, doubts and confusions of such a woman, without judgment or excess sympathy. She is just there, a fact, and completely believable.__All the possibilities of a richly drawn family squabble fade faster than the final days of summer.__This first feature from co-directors Tom Dolby and Tom Williams is too muted in its catharsis and too overcrowded with superfluous characters to be fully satisfying, but the delicate central performance keeps it watchable.__This is one Lands' End catalog of a movie, with woodsy, impeccably appointed interiors; crowded tables of culinary plenty; and a sunny society fund-raiser at the spread of a neighbor.__There's not a three-dimensional character or nuanced observation to be seen here.__Last Weekend is too enamored of this nouveau riche household to be satirical, instead offering unexpected moments of genuine warmth as a calling card for goodness.__Its eventual reach for warm-and-fuzzy emotional catharsis rings hollow among characters that never become more than disagreeably shallow products of unexamined privilege.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Elena is at once a portrait, an autobiography and a history of family trauma.__The movie becomes a defiant reversal of that sentiment, an act of creation in the face of death.__A type of cinematic performance art, with all the self-consciousness that suggests - a sibling love story that's no less heartfelt for being in the form of a first-person poem.__Mysterious and hermetic, this memoir is a collage of home movies, photographs, audio recordings and lyrical narration that reframes a troubled family history through a heartbroken lens.__This haunting and dreamlike cinematic essay is filmmaking at its most personal.__What began in beautiful, intriguing fashion ends up feeling surprisingly dull.__"Elena" unfolds like a cinematic dream whose central image is water, which symbolizes the washing away of grief.__A pained and gorgeous summoning, Petra Costa's haunted doc Elena dances with death, memory, and family, seducing viewers and then breaking their hearts.__Unfolds a story of grief and thwarted promise with expressive urgency and thoughtful restraint.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Adult World does have some smart, funny and wincingly painful things to say about the desire to make art vs. the desire to be famous for it.__Roberts is completely over-the-top here, her frantic, unfunny performance serving only to highlight Cusack's caginess and restraint.__"Adult World" is a coming-of-age story in which the starting age seems to be approximately 9. As a result, it just doesn't work.__It's packed with independent-film cliches, yet director Scott Coffey manages to rise above them, thanks largely to the performances of Emma Roberts and John Cusack.__A smart, incisive comedy about a recent college grad's booby-trapped immersion into real life.__Coffey knows his movie's at its best when Cusack and Roberts collide, and repeatedly uses them to overcome the script's limitations, and almost to dig a pit of chaos beneath it.__Mr. Cusack's sardonic, understated portrayal of Rat, who is not quite what he says he is, grounds the movie in a wistfully cynical realism.__This amiable, occasionally sharp-eyed movie makes us understand ... that lofty ambition often equals an evasion of hard work, humility and the insight that not everyone has what it takes.__There's a lot of juvenile shenanigans in Adult World.__"Adult World" proceeds by fits and starts, but fans of Cusack won't want to miss his performance as the petulant poet, whose resistance is inevitably worn down by his persistent fan.__This is the kind of cheesy, sketched-out idea for prurient adolescents that gives indie-prods a bad reputation.__Adult World captures beautifully, and with a great deal of self-deprecating humor, what it's like to feel trapped in a place you think is too small to hold you.__The story beats are as familiar as they come, and there are a few halfhearted stabs at redeeming Roberts's clueless character when it would have been better to push her feeble-mindedness to Anna Faris-esque extremes.__John Cusack delivers a deliciously deadpan performance in this uneven and self-consciously quirky dark comedy.__The improvisational zeal with which Cusack approaches his role is particularly fun to watch.__None__None__None__None__None
It's not a groundbreaking thesis, but we still get a fascinating tour of a town that may never be the same again.__The film could've benefited from another 15 or 20 minutes of detail and nuance.

Watching the film is like sitting at dinner with a teen-ager who believes that, if he swears long and loudly enough, he will shock the grownups into accepting him as one of their own.__Flamboyantly vulgar and determinedly self-referential, Deadpool has the shape of a superhero movie but the soul of a Danny McBride flick.__Deadpool is obnoxious and puerile and infantile and has an irritating meta tone so snide that it's constantly in danger of nullifying the entire movie -- and I still got a pretty big kick out of it.__It seems less irreverent than self-congratulatory.__Deadpool is everything that Hollywood has raised audiences to believe heroes are not: crass, selfish and with a vocabulary that would have made George Carlin blush.__Reynolds has never meshed as well with a character or found a better outlet for his smirking, smart aleck persona.__This is a different kind of movie. The only rule it adheres to is that tropes are made to be eviscerated, turned on their heads, and trampled over.__You're initially jazzed by his effrontery, but Deadpool, with his relentlessly glib, nothing-sacred attitude, is not an individual who wears particularly well.__this movie's junky feel is part of its charm.

So vividly immersive is Kung Fu Panda 3 - so vibrant, so tactile - it will make you feel as if you've stepped into a fully realized world. And then once you've stepped out, you'll be craving dumplings.__The new sequel lacks the tear-jerking revelations and darker edge that characterized its predecessor. Visually though, it's a candy-colored 3-D treat, from the exquisite sunset that shimmers over the panda enclave to the psychedelia of the spirit world.__I think the secret to the appeal of the entire Kung Fu Panda franchise is the enormous affection we feel for Po, that seemingly bumbling good guy who also can rise to the occasion and showcase true heroism and mystical power.__Another successful entry in this dependably smart and well-crafted franchise for kids.__Kids, especially those who enjoyed the previous Kung Fu Panda movies, will appreciate what the third movie has to offer.__The stunning visuals surpass the high standards set by its predecessors, but storywise, it breaks no new ground.__[It's] mostly like those dishes at my old Chinese buffet - stretched thin, badly reheated and really, best taken in very small quantities.__The animation is still strong - there are some interesting and refreshingly uncuddly depictions of the spirit world from whence Kai springs - but, mainly, KFP3 is too much of a good thing.__It's gloriously colorful, very funny and, better yet, unexpectedly substantive and genuinely moving.__Writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger ... unfurl the narrative with buoyant clarity, gentle charm and much endearing (read: sweetly hokey) humor. The tale's "be yourself" mantra, though nothing new, is also well used.__The main reason families enjoy the series is Po, thanks to Jack Black's frenetic and friendly approach. There's just enough huggable and HiYa! moments to keep the animated film's core audience chomping on their popcorn and glued to the screen.__Waaaaay too talky and overcomplicated.__The whole fightin'-bear jamboree is agreeable enough, but it takes some of the spotlight away from Black being Black, and doesn't jibe with messages about having a sense of self, of what makes you you.__In Hollywood's franchise game, sequels are seldom the best they can be. This one isn't, but it's pretty, perfectly pleasant and good enough.__Like a well-made dumpling, it's not too heavy but not too light, has the right amount of spice, and leaves one with some appetite for the next time.__Unfortunately, looks aren't everything. The plot is plodding and predictable.__It's easy to mistake the simplicity of plot and theme here for simple-mindedness - this isn't Pynchon or Proust. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the economy of a Zen koan, not to mention its inner harmony and wisdom.__The directors ... make sure to let Po stay the charming bumbler he's always been. That's what makes him such an earnest, lovable hero.__"Kung Fu Panda 3" has a moment or two for everyone, but no chance develop any character beyond a single dimension. The next scene has often arrived before the viewer can process the last one.__Kung Fu Panda 3 is often inspired as animation, and tired as everything else.
What it does do - is allow you to park your brain in neutral for 100 minutes, laugh at some silly jokes... and then walk out of theatre and immediately forget it ever happened. And there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's kind of refreshing.__Ride Along 2, which picks up not long after the first film ended, doesn't mess much with the formula, except that everything feels more frayed and tired this time around.__Hart and Cube are too good to settle for hawking leftovers. They deserve better. So do we.__Ride Along 2 - everything one would expect and less - is over-the-top imbecilic.__"Ride Along" was a surprise hit, earning $135 million and becoming Ice Cube and Kevin Hart's biggest starring vehicle. "Ride Along 2" is essentially more of the same, and Hart is its driving force. Ride with it.__Ride Along 2 - propelled by an unintelligent, predictable story line and enough gunplay and explosions to eradicate a small nation - is good for a few belly laughs. But not much more.__A low-wattage sequel to a comedy that wasn't exactly glowing in the first place.__Kevin Hart clowns, Ice Cube growls. Rinse and repeat.__"Ride Along 2," it may not surprise you to learn, is a lot like "Ride Along," only less so.__Eddie Murphy, please come back and show these clowns how it's done.__If you thought the first one was fun, taking another spin won't disappoint.__You'll have to be satisfied with a modest assortment of energetically comic moments here, because the story sure isn't a reason to catch this encore, and neither are who-asked-for-'em cast additions such as Ken Jeong.__As always, Hart unleashes his manic energy on the audience, but his heart doesn't seem to be in it the way it was in the original. Maybe he's getting tired of the shtick, too.__Hart has the talent and the charisma to take it to the next level and do stellar work in more challenging fare. In "Ride Along 2," he's on cruise control all the way.__Hart's willingness to throw himself down the stairs for a laugh pays off when the substandard script comes up short. Which is close to always.__To watch "Ride Along 2" is to get the sense of a screenplay that was never right, that was just pushed along on the faith the actors could rescue it.__The implausibilities, cop-movie checkboxes, and mildly wasted talent make Ride Along 2 lazy, but not downright loathsome.__As cop comedies go, "Ride Along 2" gets the job done. But this sequel to the 2014 hit comes across as a significantly less funny rehash.__At best, "Ride Along 2" is what you've seen in every other comedic cop movie. Nothing outstanding, but mindless fun.__Were the screenwriters hoping Hart would improvise the jokes as he went along? Or thinking that fond memories of "Miami Vice" would guide the audience through?
The final word on this incident will require a more thoughtful filmmaker. But hopefully, that artist will possess at least half of Bay's punishing, peerless craft.__The movie is imperfect and overlong but it's never boring. And, although aspects of its factual accuracy can be called into question, it does a decent job of chronicling what happened that night.__Several critics have given 13 Hours a pass, citing Bay's skill at action engineering. It's his failure at everything else that makes this movie as hard to endure as it is impossible to believe. #helpme__[Bay] does well here what he always does well: He keeps the action at full throttle. This is also what he does so annoyingly: He always keeps things at full throttle.__Bay's action sequences are as riveting and technically beautiful as ever, but his reductive worldview is also on display. "13 Hours" doesn't just lionize its American soldiers, it oozes disdain for everyone else.__13 Hours presents itself as a straightforward war film, but that's the last thing a subject this complex needed.__Unfortunately while Bay has an eye, he's never had an ear, and Chuck Hogan's screenplay is full of clunkers, tough-guy dialogue that seems made strictly for cheap applause.__If they are suffering the fog of war, you are suffering the fog-of-action movie, a phenomenon that Bay is all too well equipped to create, having previously worked on the Transformers franchise.__"13 Hours" is so macho it practically has a Born to Lose tattoo on its arm. It's a military grade war machine, and it comes in the same way it goes out: with guns blazing.__In 13 Hours, Bay is striving for something more realistic, and less Hollywood, than his World War II extravaganza. To some extent, he pulls it off.__A wholly fictitious bus blast had my audience applauding with glee. "That was for us!" a character grins. Yes, literally - it was invented for a crowd that prefers fist-pumping to facts.__The film wants us to feel, as one of the men they protect says, "I'm proud to know Americans like you," but we're never really given the opportunity.__Bay's goal is to put you right in these men's boots, to feel the heat, the fear, the fatigue, the weight of the weapons and the web of camaraderie.__The most surprising thing is how Michael Bay makes 144 minutes pass so quickly.__For Bay, the murky context of history isn't worth thinking about-yesterday's tragedies are today's passable action fodder.__The movie is a pummeling slog - 45 minutes of setup and an eternity of relentless combat.__All the performances are solid and the facts as Zuckoff's evenhanded book lays them out are adhered to. It's the writing that clanks and, worse, Bay's continuing inability to stage action sequences so that a viewer has any idea who's doing what to whom.__A relentlessly intense, grotesquely overblown and numbingly long account of extraordinary heroism on the part of six American security operators in the midst of horrific chaos.__13 Hours is a movie where the questions are asked first and the shooting happens later, the opposite of Bay's usual modus operandi. Bully for him and bravo for journalism, but it doesn't make for satisfying cinema.__This is the story of a fiasco, one made less so by the fierce and selfless commitment of a few good men whose old-fashioned kick-ass attitudes form the crux of the yarn's appeal.
This is a movie that desperately wants to be a raunchy, politically incorrect, gross-out comedy. It gets as far as desperate.__Nothing is rendered in a particularly funny or novel way - it's just crude, shocking statements. Therefore, the film isn't actually offensive because it's trying so hard to be and failing miserably.__Tinged with the sadness of watching a beloved elderly relative making a bloody old fool of himself.__"Dirty Grandpa" is like watching a friend's mediocre improv troupe do an extended spring-break sketch. And your friend just happens to be Robert De Niro.__Crude in nearly every sense of the word, "Dirty Grandpa" is a nasty-humored, poorly made and desperately unfunny film.__Though many of these self-consciously crude jokes don't land, those that do are the life of the party. Late-era De Niro forever, y'all.__It will make you feel bad for yourself, and anyone else who sees it, and anyone else who has to live in the world where it exists as a physical document.__If Dirty Grandpa does anything, it should be to make you stop weeping for De Niro's lost greatness. He brought this upon himself.__Dirty Grandpa feels like spending 100-plus minutes with a scatalogical toddler, proudly showing you what he made in his diaper. Don't look if you don't have to.__"Dirty Grandpa" gets ugly-drunk on its title character's preening smugness: Grandpa Dick is presented as The World's Most Interesting Man, a cigar-chomping hybrid of Sinatra and Statham, but simply comes across as TWMIM's scumbag brother.__Dirty Grandpa does have one distinction. It makes De Niro's previous comedy low point Meet the Fockers look good by comparison.__There's little chemistry between a sadly unfunny Efron and a sleepwalking De Niro, and both Jason's awakening and Dick's plotting feel forced.__It can be definitively stated that Dirty Grandpa is utterly unfunny.__Robert De Niro hits rock-bottom opposite Zac Efron in this atrocious excuse for a comedy.__It's shocking without being truly outrageous, dirty without ever really crashing taboos. And for a road-trip comedy, it pretty much stays in the slow lane. With its blinker on.__None__None__None__None__None
There's only so much she can do once the movie around her devolves into the usual barrage of jump scares, but Cohan maintains her composure even as Greta loses hers.__[It] aims to set itself squarely in the fictional canon of Chucky and its brethren, but it ends up trying to do so much that it forgets to scare us.__"The Boy" didn't screen for critics, but it's actually a pretty sturdy genre effort. Nearly free of gore... [the film] is careful and clever about revealing what Brahms really is, for he's certainly got a mind and will of his own.__It's awkward and strange but never shamelessly over-the-top enough to serve as a guilty pleasure.__It ... has enough scary moments to satisfy horror fans, but you're left wondering whether it might have been more disturbing had it stayed on its original path.__If only writer Stacey Menear and director William Brent Bell took the very real horrors of domestic abuse as seriously as they do the virtual horror of paranormal activity.__Despite game efforts by the cast, this tepid horror opus is never scary enough to overcome its silly premise.__The story takes a couple of major turns, both so blatantly lifted from other horror films that to name their titles would give away the end of the movie.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
"What's the point of any of this?" asks Cassie. I kept hoping, but no such luck. It's a question that is never answered.__Ultimately squashed by a silly and generic love triangle that makes The Hunger Games look like Casablanca.__The storyline is generic apocalyptic science fiction and feels a lot like an uninspired fusion of Independence Day and the TV mini-series "V".__The whole thing appears to have been designed by some crazed Oedipal wing of the N.R.A.__The 5th Wave plays like a Wayans-brothers spoof of movies based on dystopian Young Adult novels. Seriously, it could have been called YA Movie the way it wallows in all the overly familiar tropes of the genre.__The death and destruction in "The 5th Wave" can be highly entertaining, but once that's over, the movie must follow its predetermined formula.__the only standout in the cast besides Moretz is Maika Monroe (It Follows) as a Goth fighter with no patience for pussies. Jeez, if only Monroe and Mortez had been allowed to take over. Instead, here's another dystopian washout.__It's like Lord of the Flies by way of Michael Bay, only not nearly as awesome as that sounds.__The whole thing is just so familiar, so warmed-over.__Topical ideas on humanity, mistrust and alien-as-immigrant metaphors are a plus, but a laughable romance and a ridiculous wrap-up render the film as only a staging ground for the next two parts of the trilogy to come.__"The 5th Wave" starts off strong, but winds up drowning in young adult cliches. It's not the end of the world, but it's starting to feel like the end of this genre.__The action's pretty fair, and fairly violent, though the quality of the digital photography is all over the place, with some key night scenes descending into visual murk.__It's depressing to see Ms. Moretz - so spirited in "Clouds of Sils Maria" and the "Kick-Ass" movies - reduced to constant mooning at Mr. Roe. And yet the source novel is part of a trilogy. Expect sequels.__With two subsequent books in the series, can a movie franchise be far behind? Let's hope not.__This American movie is wretchedly written and badly directed and edited.__A kids-trained-to-kill sci-fi flick that turns mildly subversive right before taking a headlong dive into sub-Twilight soap ...__The 5th Wave makes no secret of its lust to pick up from The Hunger Games and horn in on some of that dystopian Divergent teen love.__It soon becomes apparent that these spunky teens, no matter how much they flirt with each other while brandishing firearms, are only running themselves in circles.__You'll be more than ready to wave goodbye.__This picture stands as the best argument yet that the YA dystopia cycle has passed its sell-by date.
A horrifically bad romantic comedy that serves as a celebration of entitlement, consumerism, and shallow behavior.__This concept of single still assumes that a woman must have a man, that a girl's only choice is between one boyfriend or 20.__Nothing here will blow you away -- think of this one as taking baby steps away from what's formulaic.__It's chickbait for Valentine's weekend, a fluffball that plays like warmed-over subplots from Sex and the City.__It ... exists in a candy-coated New York where everyone has infinite money, exactly six nonwhite people ever speak and Christmas is always gently covered with pristine, powdery snow.__Think of "How to Be Single" as a cinematic Whitman's Sampler: There are enough pieces that work to offset the pieces that don't.__The blandness of the film's execution tempers the praise it's owed for the relative boldness of its themes.__The film has some fun along the way, but it is more traditional than it would like to think it is.__Unsure what kind of movie it wants to be, How To Be Single is a messy mix of everything, burying the final, genuinely felt 20 minutes that could have saved this intermittently amusing, sloppily made rom-com.__How to Be Single is a lot like its Jager-bombing, romance-seeking protagonists: Cute and goofy and kind of a mess.__How to Be Single deserves credit for fashioning a romantic comedy that diminishes romance and elevates independence, even if its vision of solitude is a shallow version of "me" time.__This reheated "Sex and the City" adventure flops, even with Leslie Mann and Rebel Wilson hard at work being funny.__Turning the usual boy-meets-girl conventions topsy-turvy -- and letting women decide whether it is better to be with, or move on from the men in their lives -- is refreshing and interesting.__Being single is a mess. So is the film, and it's almost messy enough to seem authentic.__Much like its characters' romantic lives, How to Be Single is more enjoyable when it's being casual.__Lovely stuff all around.__This charming and frequently hilarious romp jumbles the stale conventions of the rom-com genre to delicious effect.__A hilarious, heartfelt and relatable rom-com, "How to Be Single" explores the struggles of dating, finding your identity and going after what you want.__"Why do we always tell our stories through relationships?" the film asks, then proceeds to tell all of their stories through relationships - except Wilson's, which doesn't merit a main plotline.__"How to Be Single" zips along at a showy pace, like binge-watching a promising comedy-drama series. But while judicious editing would streamline its vignettes, the film's vivid and vulnerable characters are pretty good company.
The silly, hand-me-down scares just don't chill.__With no compelling characters, scares, or plot points to redeem The Forest, the best option for those &#8203;curious about Aokigahara is probably to watch a 20-minute 2005 VICE documentary about it.__Pretty bad, even for a January release.__"The Forest" delivers as a healthy dose of psychological cinematic terror and an impressive first feature directing effort.__Any compelling sense of unease is ultimately undone as the film gradually settles for tedious schlock.__The Forest boasts a promising premise but squanders most of its goodwill as a result of narrative shortcuts and contrivances, horror film cliches, and haphazard editing.__Ambiguity is good in a horror movie, but with this many plot elements elbowing each other for room, none of them achieve enough clarity to be properly terrifying.__At least Dormer can now tick "scream queen" off her list of thankless jobs aspiring young actresses often have to do to establish themselves.__The supernatural thriller "The Forest" begins with an intriguing premise and fun, ghost story-type potential but quickly devolves into convoluted hokum that produces more laughs than scares.__The movie seems to be conceived as a slow burn, but it's more like a faucet dripping lukewarm water.__The only thing good to say for "The Forest" is that Dormer is interesting, that she creates a different vibe and essence for each sister, and that it would be nice to see her in a better movie.__The indiscriminate apathy with which it was made sheds off the screen like a contagion.__These woods are intrinsically terrifying. In filtering those unique qualities through an overly familiar genre sensibility, the filmmakers have rendered them anything but.__The frightening-enough feature has something for everyone: outdoorsy suspense in an exotic location, strange Japanese schoolgirls and beautiful things to gaze upon.__Zada can't manage to build tension or sustain a consistent air of dread.__By the time the credits roll, nothing makes much sense, which is typical for this sort of horror-movie potboiler - the film's trio of screenwriters apparently couldn't find a decent ending between them.__Japan's loony suicide culture seems like an adequately scary backdrop for a horror movie, but the routine horror flick "The Forest" mostly settles for cheap thrills.__The cliches are so thick, sometimes you can't see "The Forest" for the cheese.__By the time the screenwriters unpack the inevitable third-act reversals and twists, it's too little, too late, especially since those revelations rely upon an investment in the characters that the movie has expended too little effort in creating.__Dormer is sympathetic enough in her double scream-queen roles, and Zada shows an occasional aptitude for generating suspense through framing, music and sound design, even if the beats he hits are often tediously familiar.
Their latest, Hail, Caesar!, is their giddiest comedy to date, but it's also hit-and-miss within itself.__This is fairly amusing if you can get past the Coens' erasure of the anticommunist witch hunts, which destroyed hundreds of lives.__An unexpectedly sweet and utterly satisfying confection, a loving sendup of the Hollywood of yesteryear.__Not one of the Coens' major works, but it's a very enjoyable lark, especially for fans of old Hollywood.__The more 1950s movies a person has seen and the greater their love for Hollywood of 60+ years ago, the greater their appreciation will be of what Joel and Ethan have brought to the screen.__The film is often&#8203; sharp and amusing, but it's a doodle in the Coen canon.__"Hail, Caesar!" obeys the first commandment of filmmaking, attributed to the old master Billy Wilder: Thou shalt not bore.__Hail, Caesar! might play better on the small screen, where you can savor its fodder piece by piece.__There are an awful lot of subplots and comic characters but none of the actors in this star-studded cast is allowed to build his laughs and the Coens just abandon several of these vivid personalities along the way.__Rather than adding up to an interwoven story line, it's a long, rambling shaggy-dog story. I know there is a dog in it, anyway. What they intended this confusing tale to be overall, I have no idea.__It's something like a summation of Joel and Ethan Coen's films: Meaning is a missing frame, human folly is the star and only the dialogue is divine.__A hipster mash note to the way things used to be, it will put a smile on your face and keep it there for the duration.__They're not the types to go fumbling for profundity, those Coens. Profoundly funny will do.__"Hail, Caesar!" verifies a suspicion long held here, that the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, really hate the movies.__There are the serious Coen brothers movies, like "No Country for Old Men" and, um, "A Serious Man," and there are the not-so-serious ones. "Hail, Caesar!" is the opposite of their serious ones, and it is delightful.__The Coens have replaced the acid in their pens with honey, for now at least, and the result is an affectionate comedy that is also one of their most satisfying achievements.__If this were anyone other than the Coens you might think that success and a couple of Oscars had mellowed them. Not likely. "Hail, Caesar!" is one of those diversions that they turn out in between masterworks and duds.__Stacked with an all-star cast led by George Clooney, Josh Brolin and Scarlett Johansson, and packed with 1950s details about how the Hollywood studio system operated in all its self-indulgent glory in that era, Hail, Caesar! is a sly satire.__In the dailies of Hail, Caesar!'s fictional Hail, Caesar!, a title card reads, "Divine presence to be shot." To the Coens, is that a promise or a threat?__This is one of my favorite movies ever made about making movies.
I expected nothing special and wound up being thoroughly exhilarated.__Too few of Hollywood's recent offerings can boast such a simple throughline and know when to wrap it up.__A remarkable tale, confusingly told. Impressive storm sequences and a very good Pine almost save the day.__Maybe it's just the History Channel junkie in me, but I would much rather be seeing a documentary about this mission than a trumped-up drama featuring brand-name actors and CGI squalls.__This disaster flick manages to stay afloat largely thanks to the yeoman efforts of Casey Affleck.__There's nothing subtle about The Finest Hours, but much that is satisfying.__"The Finest Hours" tells a noble story of brave men who risked their lives to help others. Yet its good intentions are suffocated by its showboat style that favors effects over humanity.__Gillespie (Million Dollar Arm) and his screenwriters laudably strive to keep true to the film's real-life account from 1952... But history often needs more than just the bare facts to make for a satisfying movie.__The life-and-death moments keep it afloat.__The heroism of that small-boat crew from 1952 deserves a special film. This is not it.__Before scoffers scoff, realize that this tale of nautical derring-do has several things going for it to counteract the inherent obviousness of the material.__This thrilling adventure is periodically interrupted by a feeble romantic subplot.__The Finest Hours is all about action, suspense, and tension, and it rarely lets its audience down on any of those accounts.__It's a movie made for the kind of audiences who feel that movies aren't made for them anymore - you know who you are. If you go, you might want to bring a raincoat.__The drama is almost stillborn, thanks to a slow, deadly dull romantic preface, and it's subverted by incessant switching between spectacular struggles on the Atlantic and generic anxieties on shore.__"The Finest Hours" is set in the early '50s. But did it really need to feel like it was made during the Eisenhower era?__The real reason they don't make them like this these days is that the creators of blockbusters have forgotten that the loss of life is a tragedy, and that seeing it saved is more edifying than seeing it snuffed.__On the waves, the film finally finds its sea legs and delivers an old-school adventure based on a heroic deliverance that deserves its day in the sun.__The Finest Hours... splits in two much like the wounded vessel at its heart. There's the film that's set on the sea and much of that is pretty terrific...And then there's the film set on land, and that one runs aground.__Somewhere in here, there's a pretty decent movie.
Zoolander 2 takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original, and then embellish them in painful-often offensive, almost always outdated-fashion.__The first film scored a few palpable hits, but the new one barely makes the effort, and the poise of a work like "Funny Face," which both mocked and feted a devotion to couture, seems an impossible dream.__There are some clever bits and the satire is at times scathing but, on the whole, moments of hilarity are like oases in a desert of tedium. When Zoolander 2 isn't funny, the silliness strains the viewer's patience.__While all comedies get refined in the editing room, this one feels like it was slapped together there, as Stiller - who also directed - searched for laughs.__How bad is Zoolander 2? It's Batman and Robin bad.__It is merely dumb when it should be knowingly dumb; satirically dull when it should be sharp; and just plain ugly when it should be, at the very least, aesthetically minded.__Amounts to a parade of celebrity cameos masquerading as a movie.__[Zoolander 2] trades its predecessor's absurdist joys for the same derivative bombast that made Anchorman 2 such a disappointing slog.__Some people find Derek Zoolander funny and likable and endearingly dumb. I don't. I find him grating.__This sequel ups the ante so relentlessly that you may find yourself pining for a relaxing night of watching the 2001 original.__Zoolander 2 sweats its silly ass off to please. The results are scattershot. But when it works - oh, baby.__Almost all of "Zoolander 2" is like that draggy last 20 minutes of "SNL," when every half-decent idea has been exhausted and the only reason the show is still going is because there's time to fill up.__Like its title fool, Zoolander 2 wants desperately to be adored, despite coming hopelessly late to the party.__Zoolander 2 seems like the result of a 15-year game of "exquisite corpse," the surrealist exercise where different writers add to a story independent of each other, strand by strand, without full knowledge of previous contributions.__An incoherent and idiotic mess.__"Zoolander 2" is just another lazy grab bag of sketch ideas acted out by "Saturday Night Live" cast members and alumni, each of whom comes up with a schtick and then beats it into the ground.__Some movies keep you in a state of suspense. "Zoolander 2," a dud glitter-bomb of a sequel, eventually leaves you in a state of suspended animation, with eyes glazed over and brain in sleep mode.__Is "Zoolander 2" one "Zoolander" too many? The answer, unfortunately, is yes more than no.__Sticking Derek and Hansel in a world now dominated by smartphones, social media and selfie sticks gave the writers plenty to lampoon, but it's squandered instead on the odd hashtag joke and Netflix plug ...__When Kiefer Sutherland is the funniest person in your movie, you have a problem.
Neither its animation nor voice performances are particularly memorable, but Norm of the North, especially in its early section set in the Arctic, has its appealing moments.__It's got elements of Happy Feet, Madagascar, Despicable Me, Ice Age, and any number of other films. But most of these elements go nowhere.__Think of every trope associated with animated family movies and you'll find them all in Norm of the North, a thoroughly uninspired story of a polar bear attempting to save his habitat from a hypocritical hippie seeking to develop condos in the Arctic.__The animation already looks dated, and it feels as lazy as the bland narrative, which finds Norm traveling to New York City to try stop construction on his home.__Norm of the North is more ursa minor than ursa major.__There is no nuance to the animation or detail in the visuals; the whole thing looks like it was slapped together in time for the crew to hit happy hour at Bennigan's.__Even the trait that should endear the audience to Norm, his infamous " Arctic Shake," in which the bear goes into uncontrollable fits of dancing and twerking, becomes unbearable to watch.__"Norm of the North" feels as if it intended to be a better movie, but got confused along the way.__While the film, with its preponderance of potty jokes, might placate the very young already primed by boisterous singing chipmunks, older viewers will likely find it all harder to, uh, bear.__No. No. Just no. No child should be exposed to this.__If I wasn't already convinced of this movie's obnoxiousness, its rendering of Graham's character sealed the deal.__The title character of "Norm of the North" may be a bear, but the movie is a dog. Actually, that assessment is unfair to dogs - real, anthropomorphic and metaphorical.__The animation and character work is TV-level: so frenetic so that no real artistry is needed, but not so busy that you keep from noticing how the same background humans are repeated throughout. (I know it's a small world after all, but still.)__[Wall's] visually unimaginative style ... may work, barely, in increments of fifteen minutes or less, but fails to engage over 90 minutes on the big screen.__Not since Bratz has this writer seen a screenplay so carelessly written, a sort of "Dear John" letter to Hollywood that goes out of its way to paint actors and directors as megalomaniacal idiots.__Norm of the North seeks to blend a little Happy Feet with a side of The Penguins of Madagascar and a slice of Minions, but this cheap-looking animation studded with unfunny jokes deserves an ice-floe send-off.__None__None__None__None
We the people deserve every nutty coincidence, beautiful disaster, luxurious grief montage, and supernatural final-act reveal. Garbage-entertainment is still entertainment. Why, then, does The Choice almost entirely opt out of its own game?__You feel manipulated, but not in the I-can't-help-but-be-moved way that these films usually work. By the time its finale rolls around, The Choice has completely undone its own spell.__The latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation may turn off even his most ardent fans.__Even when things take a turn, the movie doesn't become more complicated or interesting; we simply start down an equally predictable new track.__The Choice feels like Mad Libs with some of Sparks' laziest cliches - a romantic rowboat, a colorful small-town carnival, a jealous upper-class boyfriend - and the result is a predictable, recycled mess.__As usual, love will be declared, tears will be shed, rain will fall, stars will be gazed at and dogs will be shamelessly anthropomorphized by their owners.__We are told by a male narrator in a Forrest Gumpian drawl that "the whole damn thing is about choices," and that "every path you take leads to another choice," and that "some choices change everything." Jeepers.__If you're looking for a reason to watch pretty people and cry, then, by all means, head to the theater. But it pales in comparison to other Sparks works, especially when it gets into medical-ethics territory.__Some will eagerly dig in, while others are likely to find it too sticky and overly rich.__The Choice is the cinematic equivalent of staring at a Hallmark Card for two hours.__How many times, really, can someone repackage the same generic love story, presented with all the artistry of a travel-agency brochure and affixed with yet another third-act tragedy?__There are no surprises here - okay, maybe one - and you can expect some light welling-up of the tear ducts and a few laugh-out-loud moments, sandwiched between corny dialogue and dramatic acts of love.__The only choice is to make sure a barf bag is nearby.__There is a grating sloppiness to much of "The Choice," both narratively and stylistically.__"The Choice" is the 11th feature film to be adapted from a novel by bestselling author Nicholas Sparks. They should have stopped at No. 10.__The latest, and quite possibly worst, tissue-thin weepie to issue forth from the Nicholas Sparks page-to-screen assembly line ...__Directed by Ross Katz and filmed like an ad for erectile-dysfunction medication, The Choice is almost repellently synthetic.__You might find yourself weeping tears of relief when the credits finally roll.__The film disappointingly, even lazily, shies away from being anything more than you'd expect.__The result is something with all the worst traits of a standard Hollywood romance, predictability, zero drama and, in this case, a misleading title.
It's nice to finally see the Messiah portrayed by somebody who'd probably get extra attention at a U.S. airport by Homeland Security.__"Risen" is a fascinating cultural artifact, but as a film, it's destined for no glory greater than as an appropriate cable rerun on Easter.__For a film that could have easily become bogged down in Sunday School reverence, or culture-war opportunism, Risen presents an intriguing, oblique approach to a Bible movie.__Whatever your religious affiliation, you will come away thinking that if all this did actually happen, it probably happened something like this.__Despite not doing much more than preach to the choir, Risen is still more nuanced than the lion's share of recent faith-based dramas.__It's pointed about how we treat today's zealots, as when Clavius likens the pain of crucification to "sucking air through a wet cloth" - a description of waterboarding.__It's not often that faith-based films, competing in the same marketplace that rewards action, embrace the deeper, more difficult idea of meeting hate with love, but Risen tries.__A fairly ambitious picture tailor-made for that slice of the Christian audience accustomed to the tropes and beats of prestige cable dramas.__The film features a lush historical setting and some satisfying action scenes, but the dialogue is often laughable, a mix of the pseudo-archaic with oddly contemporary lingo.__It's not especially challenging. But it is several steps up from some faith-based fare, and it will doubtless appeal to its target audience.__"Risen" was never meant as anything but a tool for the converted. Talk about preaching to the choir.__While it descends too often into the melodramatic, it's a solid, smart picture and a welcome addition to the genre.__Fiennes sticks with the brooding, stoic performance, even when Clavius is undergoing some major changes. It's not his best work.__The film ends up falling into a loop of abortive climaxes, set against an indistinguishable beige-gray backdrop of limestone, before the inevitable cheap-looking flash of CGI light in a scraggly field.__It's intended primarily for an audience of Christian believers, but genuine drama precedes the preaching.__If you drink every time you're reminded of Monty Python's 1979 Judean jaunt, "Life of Brian," you might just make it through to the end.__Risen is more entertaining than Bible-adjacent stories are usually allowed to be.__Whether or not it triggers a craze for divinely inspired detective stories, "Risen" makes a decent case for itself as the "Columbo" of the genre: It's amiable, creaky and not remotely predicated on the element of surprise.__A low-IQ affair that supposes that the Gospels will sound more convincing if seen through the eyes of a skeptic. Instead, it seeks to improve the New Testament by putting a layer of Naugahyde upholstery on it.__We know how it turns out, but seeing from the point of view of someone who doesn't know and doesn't believe adds more cogency.
The movie's mean-spiritedness becomes even more painful than the dippiness of the source material.__Wayans is ... incapable of limiting himself to parodying one movie at a time, tossing in riffs on Whiplash, Magic Mike, and Zero Dark Thirty to varying degrees of success.__As with other staples of the screen-parody genre, the comic bull's-eyes arrive only intermittently.__Wayans continues his pattern of creating movie simulacra - calling them "parodies" or even "spoofs" puts far too fine a point on it - whereby we're supposed to laugh because we recognize the thing that is being reenacted.__As a piece of cultural criticism, however, it painstakingly eviscerates nearly every scene in "Grey" and skewers latent sexism, classism and ludicrous sexual innuendoes, as well as the original's numerous plot holes.__Mostly, "Fifty Shades of Black" is exactly what you expect it will be.__If comedy is like sex, all about buildup and release of tension, then this movie can't get it up.__At a minimum, a parody should be funnier than the film it's sending up, but "Fifty Shades of Black," a quick-and-dirty riff on last year's S&M romance "Fifty Shades of Grey," falls a laugh or two short of even that low standard.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
The bottom line is that Burr Steers' adaptation is unlikely to please any audience regardless of what they're looking for.__This is a perfect film for our mash-up/viral culture in which short, clever, easily digestible bits of entertainment are passed along giddily from friend to friend. But most shareable YouTube videos run a couple minutes. "Zombies" is much, much longer.__An unexpected and off-kilter treat, thanks to a BBC-quality cast and (un)deadpan humor.__Maybe someone else can crack the code to the ultimate Austen mash-up when the inevitable "Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters" adaption comes along.__Both pride and prejudice still play their parts, but now in service to one tediously repeated joke: the sight of a gentleman or a lady, together or alone, playing cards or ballroom dancing, fatally swarmed by devouring zombies.__Like its source material - a loose term if there ever was one - Steers's movie is a failure across multiple fronts.__As clever as it is iconoclastic, this bloody good satire tickled me by overturning much, but not all, of what we admire in Jane Austen's original.__The works of Austen are endlessly adaptable, and "Pride and Predjudice and Zombies" shows they can hold up to even the most outlandish of plot devices. Talk about a writer with bite.__Steers nails the aesthetics - zombies in ornate period dress are both amusing and chilling - but has his actors playing it completely, thuddingly straight.__OK, so it's not Olivier or Colin Firth material. But writer-director Burr Steers delivers a screen mash-up that's generally done in the right, warped spirit.__Not enough has been preserved from Austen's book to give it any presence, much less gain an exciting new resonance. The only true zombie metaphor here is the impulse to turn everything into fodder for teenage boys.__Not gory enough to satisfy horror fans, nor clever enough for a really good laugh ...__Like its original source material, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies works best as a comedy of manners.__Director Burr Steers... does a nifty job of rocketing from period-piece romance to gory bloodshed, with sprinkles of dark humor here and there.__Austen geeks and zombie lovers will enjoy enough laughs to tip the scales in the film's favor.__Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is: (a) the greatest movie title since Snakes on a Plane and (b) the worst movie with a great title since Snakes on a Plane.__PP&Z is rated PG-13, so the zombie gore is decidedly decorous. But before repetition dulls the party, the movie gets in a few juicy innings.__Fun, funny, gory and yet still strangely romantic.__"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" delivers what its title promises: a little romance and some undead villains, plus a bit of comedy. But this overly busy riff on Austen's winning formula doesn't justify all the tinkering.__The skirmishes and eventual full-blown battle is garden-variety PG-13 violence - clanking swords and grunting - so the action won't past muster for a generation weaned on The Walking Dead.
"The Witch" feels at once sticky with tangible detail and numinous with suggestion.__I would prefer seeing a failed attempt at something different than a regurgitation of every modern horror trope. Yet The Witch proves unable to capitalize on being different.__Helped by along by a great cast, a haunting soundtrack and terrific attention to period detail, The Witch is an auspicious feature debut for writer-director Robert Eggers.__The Witch is wrapped up in its own views of religion, of sin, of feminine power, but more than anything else, it is wrapped up in itself.__The movie's first-time director, Robert Eggers, blends authenticity with black magic, and the result is giddying.__A feature debut of startling confidence, Robert Eggers's The Witch is not only an excellent horror film, but also a captivating study in extreme paranoia and the fragile bonds of family.__The Witch" isn't typical gorehound material; it has an art film prestige and a commitment to period authenticity.__The Witch is a stressful movie to watch, and that's meant as the highest praise.__The first great film of 2016 is a horror flick with Puritans, possessed kids, naked forest women and a haunting goat named Black Phillip.__An unsettling journey back to a time when Satan seemed much closer to our world.__It isn't engineered for hopped-up date-night scares, but its blanket of moonlit dread is certainly form-fitting ...__Like any truly successful horror film, "The Witch" operates on various levels at once and is open to interpretation.__From the very opening scene in The Witch, we are immediately thrown into an ominous journey that conveys pending doom.__With a gentle rap-rapping, Mr. Eggers intensifies the shivers with art-film moves, genre shocks and an excellent cast that includes a progressively rowdy menagerie.__The Witch immediately joins the pantheon of great horror movies, with the caveat that it's just barely a horror movie at all.__This phenomenal debut feature by Robert Eggers has a singular style and tone, and its horror flows from the deepest wellsprings of human nature.__Eggers doles out the horror sparingly and eerily: an image of blood in a milk pail, a moving shape in the shadow of a barn. The movie uses lamplight and hearth light to conceal as much as they reveal.__It's a creepy little gem, and its imagery will stay with you long after you've left the theater.__Building his film on the diabolical aftershocks of Puritan repression, Eggers raises The Witch far above the horror herd. He doesn't need cheap tricks. Eggers merely directs us to look inside. Be warned: It'll scare the hell out of you.__What makes The Witch more than a mere museum reclamation project is Taylor-Joy.
A glossy, superficial biopic set in a historical context that begs for more, Race can at least claim to be one of the two best movies ever made about Olympic hero/Hitler-embarrasser Jesse Owens.__A wallpaper-thin but sentimentally effective hagiography.__The bare necessities are there, the performances are competent, and there are some strong moments but Race suffers from a lack of ambition. It's too safe and that quality mutes its impact and limits its ability to be more than a history lesson.__Race is the most timid, lackadaisical movie that could have been made out of potentially classic material.__Where is Owens in all of this? By the end of Race, we don't know much more about him as an individual than we did when the movie began.__Race follows the pattern of so many other sports biopics in which it's white patronage that makes black triumphs possible.__A handsomely mounted drama about a pivotal moment in the life of track star Jesse Owens ...__Race wants to end, unsurprisingly, on a note of uplift-but for a film with so much dark, unexplored potential, it's an unsatisfying finish line to cross.__Hopkins films all the races with suitable elan - since Owens was a sprinter, accomplishing his feats in a matter of seconds, they are relatively easy to dramatize - but you don't leave the theatre with much understanding of how he did it.__A so-so movie about an extraordinary athlete.__"Race" tells the story of a brave and gifted and determined man who accomplished great feats during a pivotal moment in world history - but it's a by-the-numbers sports biopic with little nuance and a penchant for saccharine-soaked dramatic moments.__It's a saga of unquenchable spirit and fast-twitch muscles shot in slow-twitch style.__"Race" wants so badly to get every last bit of the big picture that it dashes past the little details that actually tell a story. Like an over-trained athlete who pulls a hamstring in the big race, the movie tries to do it all and comes up short.__"Race" is disappointing in parts, but Stephan James makes for an appealing star ...__Owens's story is certainly one that needs telling, although Race isn't as strong as it could be, even if it does include a larger narrative than one man's rise to greatness.__Director Stephen Hopkins plods when he needs to sprint, but Jesse Owens is a great movie subject. His triumph at the 1936 Olympics left Hitler to suck it up and watch a black man shatter his cuckoo theories of an Aryan master race.__"Race" reminds us that long before television elevated black sports heroes into gods, there were athletes like Jesse Owens who paved the way.__The film delivers what it promises - an education and a thrill.__Making a few admirable attempts to complicate what could have been a standard-issue inspirational sports narrative, "Race" is better than it has to be, but not by too much ...__The script and direction of "Race" are both workmanlike and serve the film well, helping us to see Owens and Snyder as ordinary people with extraordinary gifts.
Less offensively nationalistic than the second installment but falling short of the glowing humanity, genial Cantonese humor and visual flair of the first, the pic is somewhat tarnished by its pedestrian plot and limp characterization.__Yen is appealing, the story moves right along, and the martial arts sequences are (to my untrained eye) impressive. In short, a good enough conclusion to the Ip Man saga.__The plot of the film is pretty silly, but it functions largely as a fight-delivery system, and on that level it's relatively successful.__Early in "Ip Man 3," Yip is visited by a young Bruce Lee, and Yip decides he's not ready for training. But if it led to an "Ip Man 4," who'd complain?__The only real spark in the film is provided by Yen's costar Zhang Jin as Cheung Tin-chi, an upstart devotee of the wing chun school intent on knocking Ip off his hallowed throne atop Hong Kong's martial-arts pantheon.__Despite Mr. Yen's impressive physical virtuosity, his stoic, often humorless presence tends to neutralize the emotional temperature.__"Ip Man 3," set in Hong Kong circa 1959, combines the customary, inventively choreographed action with an unexpected emotional depth, proving as hard to resist as its entertaining predecessors.__There have been all kinds of Ip Man movies. "The Grandmaster," which played in Seattle in 2013, has exquisitely lovely visuals. "Ip Man 3" has Mike Tyson.__Acting is of the overdone variety and the dialogue is lousy, making Yen's restrained and quietly powerful performance stand out. Speak softly and pack a one-inch punch.__Be open to the film's emotion. It packs a bigger punch than anything else here.__Any movie that features Donnie Yen going up against Mike Tyson with fight choreography designed by Yuen Woo-Ping at least has a sense of humor about itself. But Ip Man 3...is far more than this burst of stunt casting and pop-culture cool suggests.__The carelessly plotted story consists mostly of setups for fight scenes, nicely staged in such distinctive locations as an elevator, an umbrella store and the hull of a partly built ship.__The bright idea of the first Ip Man was to use a real person's life as the rough outline for a conventional martial arts adventure. That basic premise still has some juice left, given that it's always a joy to watch Yen work.__Stone-faced martial-arts star Donnie Yen does a lot with a little in wuxia weepy Ip Man 3, the rare kung fu film whose sentimental dialogue scenes are just as good as its stripped-down action sequences.__None__None__None__None__None__None
Occasionally poignant but ham-handed and only semi-funny.__Moore, taking on his everyman role, delights in sharing that many of the programs and policies he highlights are founded on American ideals.__a crazy-like-a-fox documentary hellbent on seeing the best in people. Other people. Not us Americans. Turns out we suck at practicing what we preach. It's classic Michael Moore.__Moore doesn't keep things busy enough. Would the documentary have worked better as an HBO reality series? Things would flow better, feeling less cluttered and repetitive.__"Where to Invade Next" is documentary filmmaking gone wrong, a churlish polemic that uses the tools of propaganda to construct its world view.__It's a more impishly entertaining Moore than usual, using comedy and even a bit of fantasy to prove his point.__"Where to Invade Next" isn't only a love letter to European successes; it's a cheer-up note to Fortress America, too.__An upbeat, happy film free of Moore's usual sarcasm and his tendency to upstage the material with his ego ...__Ultimately, "Where to Invade Next" questions whether America has cast aside values that the rest of the world has come to embrace.__Along the way, Moore circles back to a fascinating insight: A lot of these progressive ideas originated in America.__The film is entertaining and disingenuous, which doesn't make it wrong.__Who knows if the ideas and solutions of other countries could even work here? But Moore, at least, offers something to think about.__As with any Michael Moore movie, attention must be paid.__As is too often the case with his work, "Where to Invade Next" isn't really about America -- it's about Moore's version of America, which means putting Moore front and center.__"Where to Invade Next" is blithely entertaining but almost completely devoid of rigor.__Presented as a menu of mix-and-match progressive offerings, the ideas gradually lose their power. They become little more than smug sound-bites.__In the more than 25 years since the bracing brashness of Roger & Me, why are Moore's documentary-making skills and aesthetic interests stuck with such an exasperating case of arrested development?__Moore here makes his strongest bona fide argument in ages, albeit one that still gleefully stacks the deck and avoids examining possible downsides too carefully. He even comes across as genuinely patriotic, in his own way.__Watching it made me feel like a deprived child with my nose pressed against the glass of a magical toy store in a faraway land. On one side is a happy, harmonious land of productive people. On the other is a world of misery, anxiety, war and greed.__The people and policies he comes to know will shock all viewers, not just the Moore faithful, who have come to settle for less.
O'Connor's movie is too sentimental and self-serious to add much of note to the mythos, but Portman embodies her character's grief no less movingly than her forebears.__At times, Jane Got A Gun comes perilously close to staying passive-to becoming A Gun Was Gotten By Jane.__As stripped-down, revisionist Westerns go, "Jane Got A Gun" may not have reinvented the wagon wheel, but it rolls out as a sturdy, well-crafted genre piece despite its rocky road to the screen.__Whatever feminist angle the film might have once aspired to is lost in its listless shuffle.__A Western with potential for feminist table-turning and old-fashioned violence, "Jane Got a Gun" is a major letdown. Despite being co-produced by Portman, the movie sells her character short at nearly every turn.__The Weinstein Company may have unloaded this embattled Western without fanfare, but it should still appeal to genre fans.__This scandal-plagued project overcame the odds to deliver an earnestly felt actioner. ... Thankfully, [it] isn't another historically revisionist, grim-dark bleak-a-thon like, say, "The Revenant" and "The Hateful Eight."__Jane Got a Gun is a slow fuse of a film that burns to a whimper instead of an explosion.__It's hard not to watch the somber Jane without thinking that this is one of those cases where the making-of could be better - and definitely more fun - than the final product.__This poor little movie fires blanks.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Lazer Team may not be a necessarily fresh story, but an energetic cast and some unique sci-fi ideas make it a fun little movie to check out for fans of the genre.__A genial sci-fi action comedy that offers plenty of fun for fanboy types.__The comedy is sophomoric and sort-of spoofy; satire happens here and there.__It's all been seen before. And given that the ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, it may be seen again. But it shouldn't.__"Lazer Team" ends by setting itself up for a sequel, but that's mighty wishful thinking. There's not a big demand for laugh-free comedies.__I think you already know by now whether you feel solidarity with the spirit of "Lazer Team," or whether you are simply no fun at all.__"Lazer Team" is a sci-fi comedy that is somehow getting released into theaters, which is good for everyone connected with it, except audiences.__Given the low budget, special effects-which range from serviceable to amateurish-aren't much of a draw here. Neither is the story, which leans heavily on cheesy formula ...__Begun as an Indiegogo campaign and now a full-fledged feature film, the Austin-shot Lazer Team is never hysterically funny but manages to capture the Saturday morning, kidvid sensibility.__Because it's made by people who understand the importance of a clever script and want their audience to have fun, Lazer Team may just prove to be 2016's most entertaining superhero movie.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Dalio's script doesn't always flow as smoothly as the camera work, but an air of calm authenticity should leave audiences touched, in a good way.__"Touched With Fire" is effective in showing the intensity of a new relationship and the barriers people build up around themselves when they take on an us-against-the-world mentality.__"Touched With Fire" raises multiple topics of discussion, then avoids eye contact when it's time for the actual conversation.__Dalio, who based the film (his directing debut) on his own struggles with bipolar disorder, establishes a gentle, honest tone that never wavers - and demonstrates a knack for vivid imagery that makes him a filmmaker to watch.__[An] earnest and beautiful but occasionally flawed drama.__An odd duck but an appealing one.__Dalio's use of images, particularly "Starry Night," is at first creative and then a little over the top. But his story is intriguing.__The production values and melodrama sometimes seem better suited for a small-screen movie. But the drama deserves points for its measured, realistic view of mental illness.__Writer-director Dalio has firsthand experience with bipolar disorder, and his perspective sheds fresh light on the unique ways in which manic-depressive individuals experience love and creativity.__Touched With Fire has something to say about a thorny, serious subject, but the light it shines doesn't really illuminate anything new.__"Touched With Fire" is an actor's field day, and both Mr. Kirby and Ms. Holmes boldly meet the challenge of playing bright, high-strung artists struggling with depression.__The film has good intentions, straining to allow both the howls of creativity and rational pleas for treatment to ring out. But its insight on either end is unremarkable, and its use of visual metaphors is especially tacky.__As personal, well-performed, and sometimes lyrical as this material is, Dalio also has a peculiar way of making it all play like a public service announcement-like a feature commissioned for a mental-wellness convention.__The film is courageous and accomplished, beautifully acted and moving for long, fitful passages.__[A] sensitively detailed and emotionally compelling drama about the exhilarating highs and harrowing lows experienced by two manic depressives during their ill-fated romance.__Old conventional wisdom about genius and madness resurfaces in Mania Days, a drama that identifies so closely with its two bipolar protagonists that many viewers will feel it promotes even their most flawed beliefs.__None__None__None__None
Shot in black and white with fade-out transitions, the movie harks back to classic westerns. But it's also distinctly modern.__Everybody in Aferim! seems to hate and demean everyone else. And yet, they all seem like parts of the same blend of cultures - not a melting pot, but sort of a stew - that reasserts itself throughout the film.__In subject and style, it's a departure from [Jude's] contemporary satires, but the period story is evidence of the same keen eye for class hierarchy, codified cruelty and the limits of self-deception.__Like many films set in contemporary Bucharest, this is a story of self-styled potentates, small-time graft, and inevitable disappointment.__A funny and brutal costume drama with a potent contemporary kick.__Shot in widescreen black-and-white on 35mm, the film combines the structure of a classic Western with the look of Eastern European films from the 1960s, to reasonably absorbing effect.__The laughs come from our disorientation at witnessing a world that is insanely peculiar, so different from ours in its understanding of right and wrong that we sit in amazement.__Aferim! plays like a sleight of hand, amusing us at a distance with vulgarisms and entrancing us with countryside while the bloody work of civilization grinds on out of the corner of our eye.__The crisp black-and-white photography and brisk panning shots across alluring landscapes capture the cruelty of the times and the pitiless course of history with a bitter majesty.__Radu Jude's most accomplished and original feature yet.__A harsh history lesson leavened by bawdy humor and classic western elements.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Slowly ... something changes, and the functionality of Porumboui's style gives way to an ever-so-slight hint of wonder.__Deadpan, determinedly low key and deeply absurd, the films of Corneliu Porumboiu are very much a particular taste, and "The Treasure" is no different.__This charmer is determinedly mundane and low-key, until an unexpected finale transforms it.__"The Treasure" is like the work of Samuel Beckett's long-lost Balkan cousin - bleak, stoic and suffused with a flinty, exasperated empathy for its ridiculous characters.__Though it almost overplays its hand with a Robin Hood storybook motif, The Treasure manages a tricky balance between low-key social satire and total fantasy.__The film is an unusual mixture of joy and cynicism.__In a manner so sly you could overlook it, Porumboiu invests this tissue-thin premise with the shadows of Romanian history ...__This is a very worthy successor to the director's lauded 12:08 East of Bucharest and Police, Adjective, and a more accessible work than his 2013 meta-movie When Evening Falls on Bucharest.__Treasure still confirms Porumboiu's status as one of the more fascinating minds working in cinema today.__Filming with long, ironically balanced takes, Porumboiu delivers an ingeniously intricate goofball comedy that evokes heroes of legend while bringing sociological abstractions to mucky life.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None
Garrel uses a panoramic frame to stress the characters' closeness (or lack thereof), and the players waltz through his simple, neatly structured script.__"In the Shadow of Women" will appeal to a passionate, but limited, audience.

Offering further evidence to the contrary is the director's latest broody musing on life, art and l'amour.__My only question is why the filmmakers chose to deliver their message so prosaically-so diagnostically-instead of trusting their audience to understand the nuances of the drama.__Garrel may not be saying anything new about the capricious whims of the heart, but he does so with a purity of narrative and tone, and with thoroughly convincing performances from his stars.__Mr. Garrel is always worth attending to when he takes up the rhythms and paradoxes of love, and even though this is a minor entry in his canon of melancholy romances, it is brief, brisk and intermittently affecting.__What distinguishes In the Shadow of Women are its naturalistic performances - especially Courau's - and its elegantly composed shots and offhand rhythm.__Perhaps, having made so many movies that feel like ghost stories, Garrel deserves to take it easy for once.__The sturdy elements of '60s-era French romantic drama -- crummy (yet charming) apartments, horrible breakup scenes and a relaxed sense of time -- come together in this beautifully realized black-and-white throwback.__Filmed in widescreen black-and-white that makes Paris look both decrepit and irresistible, this is a swift tale of what men and women want versus what they settle for.__In so shrewdly exploring the illusions - namely (self-) deception - required to keep a dyad functioning, Garrel shows just how much we all remain, consciously or not, in the dark.__In the high-contrast, black-and-white, wide-screen images, Garrel captures creative and erotic passions with a spontaneous classicism and a monumental poise.__Merhar saves In the Shadow of Women with the simplest of gestures: a smile.__Initially somewhat wispy-feeling, this 72-minute feature transforms in its final reel from an ironic divertissement to a work of considerable feeling and intensity.__Veteran post-Nouvelle Vague helmer Philippe Garrel serves up an exquisite three-hander about life, art and the delusional male ego.__None__None__None__None__None
The plot is even more nonsensical than it sounds, but the monsters' high-energy antics and the humans' martial-arts skills make for a delightfully bizarre adventure romp.__Some of this recalls Stephen Chow's "Journey to the West," minus the brilliance.__The film is far from perfect, but it's certainly ambitious, often entertaining and, compared to the feeble competition from new American films of the moment, a singing, dancing, stomping and chomping "Citizen Kane."__"Monster Hunt" broke box office records in China, but American viewers may wonder why this confused and confusing adventure-comedy enthralled audiences there.__Director Raman Hui mixes martial-arts fights and slapstick comedy (lots of mugging by Jing) into a whimsical, fast-paced monster mash.__[Hui] does not achieve the surreal grandeur of Hayao Miyazaki's animated films, but he has enough imagination and talent to engage his audience on its own level.__"Monster Hunt" has visual appeal to spare, but the allure ends there.__Scene after scene of violent standoffs, narrow escapes, and weird-looking creatures-like Star Wars but with a lot more slapstick and fart jokes.__If you're willing to overlook some monstrously big plot holes and logic gaps, this half-animated Chinese blockbuster is an agreeably bonkers, occasionally disturbing cinematic ride.__Raman Hui's Monster Hunt is a kid-friendly adventure fantasy that may be too slowly paced for its target demographic.__Its technical wizardry and zippy, Hollywood-influenced storytelling smarts dwarf any brand of tyke-skewing entertainment China has ever come up with.__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None__None

Band of Robbers doesn't quite spin its imaginative conceit into comic gold, but it offers some minor pleasures along the way.__This clever updating of Mark Twain finds Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer involved in a comic caper.__In addition to Twain, the directors clearly worship the Coens, specifically "Raising Arizona."
